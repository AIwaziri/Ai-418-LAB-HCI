In this episode we’ll talk about the business of The Vertical Space and discuss how drones, electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL), electric aircraft, and all elements within advanced air mobility deliver value or plan to deliver value to their customers and their investors. We're going to discuss why we started the podcast, why we think the topic is important for so many, especially entrepreneurs, a little bit about ourselves - so you know who's behind the podcast - and we're going to talk about the upcoming topics and the types of guests who will be joining our show.

For those of you who've been listening to many of our last several podcasts discussions, especially those with Rob Britton and Jeff Luckett, you'll find our discussion with Kevin a perfect follow on. After discussing areas where some may disagree with Kevin, we launch into an overview of electric aviation. And the industry that blossomed due to its introduction. Kevin also discusses that the electric-only industry hasn't seen the battery progress that many had hoped, which has pushed back the timelines of many fully dedicated electric vehicles. We also discuss how electric only vehicles especially eVTOL have more limited near term use cases. We then talk about hybrid propulsion versus electric propulsion. We discuss what parts of hybrid propulsion are changing the fastest today, and it's different and unique use cases. We then discuss why an operator in regional air mobility would select an electric vehicle versus what some would consider the more obvious choice of hybrid electric propulsion. We delve a bit deeper into regional air mobility and how overall electrification may increase the use of regional air mobility. We discuss the pluses and minuses of pure electrification hybrid and traditional aircraft on regional air mobility as well. Kevin wraps up our discussion with some great advice for our innovators and entrepreneurs. Kevin, thanks for joining us for a terrific discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Kevin Noertker, as you profitably innovate in The Vertical Space. Kevin Noertker is co-founder and CEO of Ampaire. Over the past eight years, Kevin and his team have pioneered practical, compelling electrified flight through the upgrade of existing aircraft types. In 2019, they flew the world's largest hybrid electric aircraft. In 2020 and 2021 they deployed and demonstrated electrified flight with multiple airlines across the globe. With over 23,000 miles flown hybrid and 12 plus regulatory flight approvals across three countries to date, they're a leader in hybrid electric aviation. Prior to Ampaire, Kevin contributed engineering and program management expertise to advanced aircraft and satellite technology development programs at Northrop Grumman and as a research fellow at Caltech and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An entrepreneur at heart, Kevin is driven to apply the science and engineering disciplines of large aerospace organizations to pressing environmental problems here on Earth.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, Kevin, welcome.

The first is, we're in sustainable aviation and there's a lot of talk about new design planes and new markets, eVTOL and, high speed new design jets. And first is, I believe that we need to start with propulsion rather than airframe design. And there's a whole lot of good that you can do with new airframe designs, but novel propulsion is how we've seen these transformative moments progress in the past, whether that's the dawn of powered flight or the jet age. And I think you need to get the propulsion right before you start doing the transformative vehicle designs. There'll be a lot of people out there that might disagree with me on that one. Number two is that,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, I'll just, if I could jump in. I had a very senior transportation leader call me last week and say exactly\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>that's great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After listening to so many of our podcasts, he called me up and said, I want to talk about propulsion. And then I, as we were preparing for this, I was thinking, Oh, wow, this is perfect timing. So at least there's one person out there who agrees\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I appreciate that. Well, he and I should grab coffee sometime. I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp>great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And to add this strikes me as perhaps more commonly held view than perhaps you are alluding to. All the new technology waves in aviation revolve around or are enabled by new propulsion. So what is it about this particular statement that, the industry disagrees with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's the idea that you need to do the new airframe design with the new propulsion in the first embodiment. Ampaire over the years has gotten a lot of pushback from industry stakeholders about doing upgrades of existing aircraft types. But you can't capture the full opportunity, they say, by upgrading an existing plane, you really need distributed electric propulsion, or you need the new airflow augmentation, or your vertical lift features, and that they believe that those features are going to drive the adoption dynamic, and that propulsion retrofits which is the path Ampaire has taken, is not a sufficient starting place. I think that's where the differentiation comes in. Because certainly eVTOL, let's take as an example, requires novel propulsion. what I'm saying is we can decouple those as a first step. Not to belittle the benefits that you would get from a clean sheet design, or maybe it's ultra short takeoff and landing performance. But the fact that designing a plane around propulsion that is not yet certified, that does not yet exist, is a recipe for having to redesign that plane half a dozen times. And we've already seen people burn a lot of capital going through that path this turn of the wheel. But if you just look in history, I mean, this is new design planes that didn't do it around existing propulsion. That's one of the big gotchas in the, in the design space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And there was another thing that you wanted to flag.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This is going one layer down there for propulsion. Hybrid electric is the only approach that makes sense right now. There are many exciting technologies. Obviously, fully electric is a dream many of us have. There's some corner cases where fully electric might work. There are a lot of people pushing hydrogen, but the reality is just like on the ground. Hybrid electric is going to lead, it is the gateway technology to this future. And I think it's going to be the gateway technology for decades.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I didn't expect a different answer from you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'm talking about, anything with commercial relevance, where operating flexibility, that is range, payload, airports that you can fly to and from, anywhere in the economics, anywhere that matters, and you need to get to scale, hybrid electric is what'll get you there.

Why is it that the industry doesn't think that hybrid is the way to go?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think back to when we founded Ampaire. And I think back to a lot of the people in this industry who have such deep passion for making a positive impact on the world around us. And those core motivations for many are about usually one of two things. Either they care deeply about the environment and they want a true zero emissions solution. And that forces their designs into a fully electric or, a strong hybrid where you're flying fully electric for some period of time, or a hydrogen where they can claim a, zero carbon emissions in flight, if it's a fuel cell. And so what you see is this desire to have a pure carbon, remedy. And that causes people to not prefer the hybrid electric type approaches or these hybrid approaches where, you know, 50 percent fuel savings, 50 to 70 percent in our vehicles is phenomenal, but it's not zero. And if you're here on only principle and unwilling to look at anything but the pure solution, then that would bias you against it. The second is, there are some people who are pushing toward this idea of you have to start with the absolute simplest, simplest possible architecture, even if it's not possible today. And electric is phenomenally simple. And the maintenance costs are super low, and in theory you can get the economics to play out, depending on your battery assumptions. And if you believe, if you have certain optimisms in that area, then you don't want to give yourself the complexity or the crutch of having to do the partial via hybrid solution. And I think that keeps some people away from it because they say, oh, batteries will get there. Like, let's just wait around for those. But I think they miss the point that if you can serve, 10 times the market size by using hybrid electric, and you're saving half the fuel burn on that. That's, do the math, it's five times the positive impact of a few or zero emissions on that one tenth of a market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Let's talk about electric aviation. Zoom out a little bit, catch us up on some of the major milestones in electric aviation over the last several years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, electric aviation has had some pretty amazing progress in the last decade or so. The earliest companies in this industry were founded in the, 2010s but very few were talking about them at that point in time. You had the starting of, the NASA X 57 program. By the time Ampaire was founded in 2016, there still really weren't that many companies that were publicly acknowledged doing work in this space. Since then, we've seen this, this, blossoming of ideas, of concepts, I remember, the first time, I think, Peter, you were, you might have even been there at the, Uber Elevate Conference out in Dallas in 2017. There's this industry that built up around the enthusiasm for electrification. And then you saw hundreds, I believe the number peaked at over 700 different projects in this space. A lot of ideas, a lot of people who really get excited about designing airplanes. And, want to go through the features. So, big milestones. You've had first flights, whether those are the flights of the Pipistrel Alpha Electro, or ultimately that being delivered to customers around the world. You have the first flights of various development program aircraft, Ampaire's first flight in 2019, and, subsequent iterations, for example, our, Caravan flight in, 2022. The industry's also made progress from, simple demonstration of flight capability to very specific capabilities. So in eVTOL, the progress of transitioning from vertical lift to fixed wing flight has been a, a big challenge where still only a handful of companies have safely made that transition or done so with a pilot on board. These are critical milestones that will drive confidence in adoption and ability to gain regulatory approvals on the, on the operations. You've seen some incremental progress along the battery energy density. standpoint, so a lot of folks are waiting for batteries to have significantly higher watt hours per kilogram, so the gravimetric energy density in the lithium ion batteries in particular. And we've seen some modest progress on that and some really amazing announcements. Some groups who are in the chemistry side trying to, get up toward, past 500 watt hours per kilogram, targeting 1, 000 watt hours per kilogram, pretty audacious goals. I think, the industry hasn't yet seen, as significant of progress as many had hoped, and that's, that's pushing back timelines for entry into service of the fully electric, fully electric vehicles. And then from a certification standpoint, some pretty big milestones. Back to 2018, where we were kicking off a ASTM committee around electric vehicle chargers, through all the SAE committees or other industry groups working together on certification. While these might not be the visible milestones that hit the press, there's certainly the milestones and progress that help move the industry forward. And so, watching folks get their first certification bases established, or get a, get means of compliance agreed upon, or special conditions, moving forward, ultimately looking, I think here in the next few years, we'll get the first full, regulatory approvals for commercial operation. And, and each of those are some of the very meaningful milestones that are, happening real time and coming up soon.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the surprises for me was, the lack of certification events following Pipistrel's EASA certification of their, Velis Electro aircraft in the LSA category that was back in the summer of 2020. And then earlier this year, I think in March, the FAA issued an LSA airworthiness exemption for that same aircraft. But here we are four years later and no other electric aircraft has been certified. Why do you think that's the case? What's the bottleneck? about the.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think the, there are a few things. One is, the regulatory basis for certification. And the Pipistrel products didn't fully open up the Part 23 or the vertical lift, certification arena. it was in a different category initially. And I think that while it made progress and maybe others could have taken their products through that same, the, you know, the identical regulatory pathway, many of the products that are out there that we most were paying attention to are in Part 23 or the vertical lift category, which was not as fully opened up through the Pipistrel application. Think second was a bit of the dynamics in the market, so with the pandemic in 2020, I think a lot of milestones were dragged out a bit. 2021, money was easy, and I think that meant that money went to moonshots. So easy money doesn't mean it goes to practical, near term, near term wins. And so I think that a lot of the money that was being invested in late 2020 and throughout 2021 was going toward long horizon plays. So purposefully not aiming at super near term strategies. And I think that overfunded those, and we've seen many get significant funding, but then burning through it, and I think it underfunded the pragmatic strategies. and so what you saw was further pressures on or delays to the timelines for entry into service for those that might not have been as flashy, but were, were just making the, the next increment of meaningful progress. And then we've seen the retrenchment of the markets where now there's a bit of a recoil. I think, the industry's at risk of losing credibility. Given all the claims that were made and failed to be lived up to, whether that's certain timelines, or product performance, or cost metrics for the products. And so, I think the industry, in particular the capital allocators, may be licking their wounds from those moonshot projects that didn't play out, which doesn't help again those that are near term. What it does is it pulls back more capital away from everything, and so if you're looking at that as a lowering tide, each of these dynamics I think is has pressed away from certification milestones that we might have otherwise hoped to see more rapidly after the Pipistrel's early successes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what about the maturity of the enabling technologies themselves and the certifiability of the motors and batteries. What's the status there? And I was recently catching up with another founder and we started talking about this and it was surprising to hear how the regulatory bodies are trying to apply traditional propulsion system requirements to electric motors. So for instance, I think there's a requirement somewhere in internal combustion engines that they need to be able to run for, I think it's five minutes in max rated power, whereas an electric motor reaches its thermal limit, a lot quicker, maybe within, two minutes or so before needing to throttle back. And so that is one contentious issue, allegedly as is the example of having dual magnetos in ICE engines, and does that translate into, you know, double architecture in electric motors, all of that increasing mass, increasing budget, and really not making that cost equation as favorable as initially expected. Do you have any insights into those aspects of how the bottlenecks are being tackled at the certifiability and the maturity of the technologies?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think that this gets to one of the really critical and core risks in the industry, which is the supply chain and the ability to not just invent something, but to produce it reliably many times at a good economics. That's really what builds the markets here. I think the regulatory bodies are trying to adapt to what they know. And, those adaptations, whether it's the Part 23 rewrite, which adapted combustion type expectations to, an opener, larger net for what kind of technologies could actually be used to meet those requirements. But in the details, they're still looking for that familiarity. So what's your mean time between failure? How long can you run at full power? What are the failure modes and effects, and making sure that you're going through the detail on that? This is the, the specifics that you get into when putting together your program certification plan, your means of compliance, or ultimately going through the testing for your, Type Certificate or STC, and it is, it's really where the rubber hits the road in the industry. I don't think that all the answers are there yet. I think there are the early entrance, certainly Ampaire is, at least to our knowledge, the only company working on a hybrid electric propulsion system certification program actively with the FAA. And so this means that we are, we're clearing many of those open questions actively with them and collaboratively with them. It also means that we have, expectations upon our supply chain that, emerge over time if something, for example, with the FAA, brings up or highlights a requirement that we did not expect. As you talked about with the motors. for these questions about redundancy, there's what you could expect as a technologist, like you'd understand the technology and you believe this to be true, some level of safety, let's say, but that does not mean that will be accepted on the first pass through certification. And in fact, I think that the first paths through certification are going to be relatively risk averse and risk managed in those setting a higher bar for redundancy, not giving you credit for levels of safety that you think you might deserve. So, case in point, for the lithium ion batteries, no matter what you do to the cells, no matter how you package those cells into your modules, no matter what physical, interconnect or disconnect controls you have that might mitigate thermal runaway, or physical barriers that might mitigate propagation or software layers that are on top of all of that. The belts and suspenders and layers of safety. At the end of the day, the FAA, probably rightly so at this stage, requires you to show that you have physical barriers that if you force the battery into thermal runaway, the vehicle will be safe. So you don't get, you don't get actual credit for everything below that. You need ultimate safety and then all the other stuff that you thought was going to be sufficient. And these are, again, I don't think it should be surprising to anybody that the earliest, earliest applications, we're going to take a, the most risk managed approach. But what it means is that when you're a battery engineer on your fully electric vehicle, you're now doubling the weight of all these additional systems when you thought you could get there just with a really good BMS algorithm. And so what it drives is the decisions and it drives the, ultimately the designs into corners that might not be viable given some of those early assumptions. This is why we pushed again toward hybrid electric, because with a battery pack, a third the size of a Tesla pack and able to take on the extra weight and the payload hit along with it for all these physical layers of safety, we still have phenomenal performance on our system. and I think that these are, these are areas where the industry is trying to navigate alongside the regulations to mature, the solutions and the risk, together.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, what electric aircraft are selling in meaningful numbers today that you're impressed by?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you say stelling, I'm gonna assume you mean where there's a cash transaction and somebody ends up with an airplane. in their hangar at the end of it, and right now the only airplanes that are selling, are the Pipistrel aircraft at this time. There are many organizations placing orders, pre orders for, eventual deliveries, but at this stage, very minimal on the actual sales in this market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Kevin, what are you seeing as the FAA's thought process for how industry is going to incorporate improvements in hybrid electric propulsion systems into these aircraft in the coming years. These aircraft are long lived assets. Batteries still seem to be improving pretty markedly over the years. Motor technology as well. So if you certify something, on the one hand, you're locked in at that point in time, are they going to use an STC method for bringing improvements in? Or is there something that is even more fluid for allowing that, that they have in mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's a really good point because the technology base is moving so much faster than the time scale of a vehicle life, right? These aircraft last 40 years. And the, batteries are improving on the, on the order of every two to three years, you'd expect people wanting an upgrade of their battery pack to the next generation, a little bit like people might want their new iPhone every few years. The way you go about certifying your product matters. And if you wrap everything into the type certificate, then you need to amend or update the type certificate when anything changes. And so that would require a supplemental type certificate for certain types of changes. Generally, propulsion systems, propellers, or airframe changes require a new type certificate, or a amendment, or a STC, supplemental type certificate. There are things you can change on an airplane without having to go get an STC. You could replace a conforming part with an equivalent part. You're able to show certain equivalent levels of safety. And so there are efforts to try to find ways that these components which would be replaced over time, let's use the batteries as an example. Batteries degrade over the cycles of use, and every few years you want to replace those. You have to go get an STC for the new battery pack are you able to use a TSO type of process? Basically a lighter version of those approvals. And it really depends on exactly how that battery pack was incorporated into the vehicle level certification. So is it part of the engine? Is it part of the aircraft? Is it a safety of flight critical component? And then as technology improves, One of the things in aviation is you lock yourself into the parts that you designed and that an in any change in that part requires a change in your regulatory approval. So as batteries improve, how do you go through that certification pathway? Again, generally, what I think the industry will see is we guarantee equivalent performance while providing improved performance. And that all you're doing when you're meeting the existing regulatory waterline is you're saying we're at least as good as we were previously, and we haven't changed any flight characteristics. The question will be, when do you want to take credit for that? When do you want to allow the operator to plan a longer route? You can give them more energy, which gives them more safety, or maybe it gives them more flexibility on how many, how many flight miles they can perform or when they need to recharge at the other end. But it might not be part of the underlying. certification, performance capability of the vehicle that you've, that you've sought from the regulatory body. Now, this is a nuance, but it's the difference between having to go through the full cert program for the new tech or just increasing performance but taking credit for an equivalent level of safety. One specific point here, in our hybrid system, I have triplicate redundancy in our hybrids. We are phenomenally safe, and I believe safer than a traditional combustion engine would be, where it's a single point failure for the traditional engine. And in our, in Ampaire's system, we have redundancy, two layers of redundancy in the combustion engine. And then also this independent electric system, which is able to carry you further as well. But am I going to get credit for anything more than a single engine capability? Probably not. and that's understandable, at least initially. And I think over time, what people, what you'll get is additional credit for those things from the regulatory body. And in the interim, when new tech, motors, or batteries come out, It'll be at equivalent levels of safety as what was there previously.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What components of the hybrid electric propulsion system are changing the fastest right now, be it the battery systems, the motors themselves, power electronics, or something else? What do you see as the fastest changing or evolving?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, the fastest changing components historically have been those which had the benefit of riding the coattails of other industries. Aviation, as big as we love it and believe it is, is much smaller than, as a market driver, than other forms of ground transportation. And so we have been the recipients of rapid technology improvement across lithium ion batteries as energy density, volume density and cost get brought down. The, the motors have been a, truly the underlying enabling factor in many of these cases. So the power density of motors is pretty phenomenal compared to where it was a decade ago. And we still see companies that are, and we work closely with companies that are pioneering in this space. And you can start, you're getting great efficiencies and really high, power density out of these motors. Where, certainly Ampaire has locked most of the components for our launch product, but we have a flying testbed where we're able to bring in new technologies, where we first flew a silicon carbide inverter, when we have brought in new motors, inverters, and energy storage tech. And it's really in those, the motors and batteries that most people are pushing firmly for innovation, and then a bit in the efficiency of the power electronics, but a lot of that currently is, seems like it's lab scale technology. And while our work with ARPA E and NASA enables us to make that move even faster, I hesitate to, to think that lab technology today is going to rapidly enter commercialization anytime soon. I think we've seen a consistent trend that timelines for those developments take much longer than, than the, the technology teams would, would have originally anticipated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is aviation going to continue to benefit from advances in the automotive industry around the batteries that they use? Or is there going to be a fork in the road where the needs of aviation diverge from what the auto industry is pushing towards?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, the auto industry used to have range anxiety. But then battery energy density got to the point that you can drive hundreds of miles. There's a sufficient charging network. So I don't see the energy density being what automotive is optimizing for anymore. Really, I think automotive is going to continue optimizing for cost, and we've seen that over the last few years. Bringing the cost of an EV down is the driver for adoption more than bringing the range up. Whereas in aviation, we're still in that bringing the range up is the requirement. And so this is a divergence in the optimization goals for the technology coming out of automotive. Now the question would be, even if the goals are different, is the state of the art, the state of knowledge and capability, is that going to improve? As folks go toward lower cost, are we going to also see emergent benefits for aviation? Absolutely. As people do innovation and build new types of electric machines, it's no longer just about what is Tesla using in a Roadster, it's about where the larger vehicles, your mid duty and heavy duty trucks, what are the power requirements for those vehicles. What are the energy densities required for those? And so it's this expanding fringe of requirements that I think will also drive a, an alignment in, in, in emerging technologies with what aviation is looking for. But the core of a ground car is, is less likely to directly align with aviation than it did over the last decade in my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Are the batteries that you would design around for your hybrid electric conventional takeoff and landing airplane, are they the same ones that you would design around for a VTOL aircraft? And the reason I ask is that, an additional difference that I've, come to appreciate with batteries for VTOL aircraft is the power output demand on them, especially requiring high power output at the end of the flight as the aircraft transitions back into vertical flight to make its approach at the landing pad. That's a particularly, stringent requirement on the battery system. For what you're doing, I don't know, maybe that still exists. Maybe it's the same battery. Maybe you, you can, use the same tech, but how do you think about that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a nuance that most of the world, unlike you, Peter, most of the world doesn't catch the nuance between the different types of batteries. The power density versus the energy density needs to be tailored for the application. And what's interesting is you gave two examples. I'll add one more in there around fully electric airplanes. So let's take your eVTOL, which is fully electric, but requires huge amounts of power at a low state of charge at the end of flight, right? So you need a power cell there. Then you have a fully electric airplane, which has a large amount of batteries. And so actually a relatively low C rate, especially if it's conventional takeoff and landing. You're not really draining where, for those listening, the C rate is the rate of charge or discharge. as a proportion of the total pack size. And so that, when you have a really large pack, relative to your pack size, you're not discharging that rapidly. And so those can be energy cells, because you don't really need that high power C rate. But then you go to a hybrid electric plane. And as I mentioned, our pack is about a third the size of a Tesla pack. These are pretty small, actually. When you come through our hangar, you see this battery is big enough to fly a Caravan, really. And that is because in a hybrid, you use the battery differently than you would in the fully electric. A small battery pack, but you still have pretty high power for takeoff and climb. Again, now you need a higher C rate. You need more of a power cell. And so for each application, you do actually have different requirements for the type of the type of chemistry you might consider, the, tailoring of that cell between energy and power, certainly the life cycle economics of the pack, the degradation over time, you might have great power or great energy, but if you only cycle 400 times, then are you useful? There's a, there's, there are all these pieces that go into the details of selecting a battery. And this is the challenge that some companies who are trying to do a one size fits all, cell or module for everybody, need to hit the high waterline or miss the, miss the mark on their, their certain markets. And this is again, why I think it's so important to have a more flexible design where let's say that I need to increase the size of my pack a little bit because I'm not getting exactly what I wanted out of my supply chain, where we can handle that. it's not ideal. We don't desire it, but when you have a, an approach, which is just a little bit more flexible than, the pure heart requirement, I think most eVTOL folks. A lot of the ones who have decided to in house their battery development is because they realize they will not get precisely what they need from anyone else, and they have to tailor it directly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Given the advantages of the hybrid propulsion to electric, why would the eVTOL or the electric plane companies go purely electric versus hybrid? What would be some of their rationale?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Number one is, that I hear from them is on the emissions. They want to be able to say they can operate fully zero emissions. Number two is a statement around, around complexity, the economics of maintenance and that's a, it's an interesting argument which, without being deep into the weeds, it's hard to validate or, dispute. All the weeds that I've been in have shown that fully electric still has a way to go before it's economically more viable. But those are usually why I see, that it can, there are other ancillary features, like, for example, noise characteristics are important for communities. Oftentimes the reason communities get upset with aviation is because of the noise. And hybrid electric does not fully eliminate the noise profile, to the extent that full, that fully electric does. Fully electric planes, if you've ever flown in one, it's like being in a glider a lot of the time. It's really beautiful. and I think that some people have hung their hats on the sound, and frankly, to their credit, if you're an eVTOL talking about flying to the city center of Manhattan, you better be thinking about sound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's not how people are going to scale in the next several years. At the end of the day, regional air mobility most likely is how a vehicle is going to scale in the next, let's face it, 5 to 10 years. And given regional air mobility, given the requirements of the vehicles, I'm guessing that hybrid is going to be the, the limitations of hybrid are not nearly as impactful as they would be if they go into city center. And how many city center flights are going to be occurring in the next five to ten years, and especially at scale. So my guess is a lot of people right now listening are saying, hybrid's the way to go. Why would they not be saying that, especially as we start to talk about regional air mobility?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so it depends on who they are. Let's say that you are an eVTOL developer. We know many. And you've spent the last half a decade, investing how many hundreds of millions of dollars into your pure electric design. That is tailored, that every inch of it is optimized specifically for your fully electric operation. You don't have volume, you don't have weight, you would have to redesign your plane in order to integrate a hybrid electric system. And I know this because I've worked with those groups, and we have shown that you can apply a hybrid electric system in. But shoehorning a hybrid into a combustion plane is one thing, that's where we enter the market. Shoehorning a hybrid into something which was designed for a little battery pack, is a completely different beast. And I think a lot of these developers have gotten so deep into their fully electric application that they don't have the payload and volume capacity to take on the hybrid electric into their current designs. And so,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But let's move on. Let's say, Kevin, sorry, great answer, but let's talk about the operators who are going to be purchasing these vehicles. Why would they consider a fully, let's again, let's step into regional air mobility. Why would they consider a fully electric plane with its, with some of its limitations? Obviously some pluses, but the hybrid I would assume is still less noisy, for example, than a traditional combustion engine. Why would they consider a fully electric plane rather than a hybrid for regional air mobility in the next 5 to 10 years? What's their rationale? Put yourself in the position of an operator who has to make that decision.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so I would ask, what's the risk? Am I, what, truly, what's the risk? The risk that I put down an order? Even if it's binding, I'm sure there are tons of outs that if it, if this doesn't meet my performance requirements, I don't have to buy it. And probably if I'm putting money down, it's going into an escrow that it can come back to me. Most aren't putting money down for the fully electric, type orders that are out there. And so I would look at it and say, I could place an order for a fully electric plane and if it doesn't pan out, great. If all of the Swiss cheese of good things going right doesn't occur, I probably got a boost to my marketing and brand along the way, and I'm not out any money at the end of the day, I could probably still buy a hybrid down the road. Now, the reality is a lot of these groups are falling behind in our order books, so, potentially they won't be as, as, as early as they would like, but if magic happens and the performance is what people would love electric to be, then I get the electric plane and everything that I needed. And so I think it's a risk posture that, the benefit of placing a signaling order outweighs the risk. And the key for me, as Kevin and with my Ampaire hat on, is those folks still place orders for hybrids. Right? Like, when I talk to folks, they're like, Kevin, this is the first thing that I actually have confidence is going to come to market. I'm going to place an order for this. And what's silly is some of those people still say, and by the way, we don't want to talk publicly about this because our brand is still like fully zero emissions, but we know that this is probably going to come in first. And so we'd like to take part in it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, in what way is certifying a hybrid configuration easier or more difficult compared to certifying a battery electric?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah.

The safety case for our system in the, condition where you assume you have an issue with the electric vehicle system, which is really what is the novel, parts of the technology. If you're in a hybrid electric condition like ours, you fall back onto a combustion engine and you fly home safely. We have full cruise capacity. With our combustion engine, so there's no degradation or risk to that operation if you shut off the electric system in flight. You can't say that for a fully electric, or hydrogen, for example, system that, when you have an issue, maybe you have redundancy in the battery packs, but the level of safety that you can, that you can, take credit for in the hybrid is quite a bit higher. And, and certifying that is, is we believe going to be faster and lower complexity and lower cost than going fully electric. The second is around the size and, requirements on each of the subcomponents. So whether it's the batteries or the motors, when you look at the reduced consequence of an issue, you can also, take different or take a different balance on the, the probability of certain issues occurring. And, and so the holistic risk analysis for the, the safety case, we have a little bit more flexibility. And that means that flexibility translates into the supply chain and our ability to move a bit more quickly and getting those, getting those technologies through the certification program.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the expected efficiency gain of a hybrid electric conventional aircraft versus the efficiency gain that we are seeing from hybrid electric automobiles? And is there a difference? And if so, why? And then we can get into efficiency gain that you would see from just like retrofitting an existing airplane versus designing an airplane around hybrid electric. Especially for the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft because going to electric propulsion when you want to do distributed electric propulsion for vertical flight or for electric STOL, okay, we get that, right? There's a capability there that's earning its way onto the aircraft. But if you are going for conventional takeoff and landing, and you are looking for an efficiency gain, what can we expect to see?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the efficiency of these hybrid systems, and I, I see hybrid as this gateway technology that as the underlying technology improves directionally toward fully electric, all of it will first get proven out in these hybrid electric systems, conditions. One of the, one of the great drivers for adoption of hybrid electric is the fuel efficiency of the systems that, that we and have already demonstrated and have been flying tens of thousands of miles so far in our hybrid systems and demonstrated a 50% fuel burn reduction. During takeoff and climb cycle, we're up closer to 70 percent fuel burn reduction. So these are actual measurements, right? This is not just an Excel spreadsheet model. This is empirical data and is the kind of benefit that you can get in certain embodiments of hybrid electric systems. So this is, pretty, pretty significant fuel savings, even when you're looking at the, the opportunity of hybrid-electric on the ground, where, call it maybe a 40 percent fuel savings, to 50 percent fuel savings on the ground. And it's all about the specific architecture of the system that drives the beneficial economics. Fuel is one of the largest, if not the largest, operating cost for most airlines. And so the fuel burn reduction then drives a positive cycle for the economic viability of new routes and market growth and higher frequencies of service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What phase of flight are these efficiencies realized the most?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, if you're just looking at a pure percentage basis of fuel savings, takeoff and climb is where you're getting the biggest boost from the electric system in our current architecture. There are lots of different hybrid architectures, and we've got a few of them, but what we're launching into product, into market with is a integrated parallel hybrid architecture where we use the electric system effectively as a boost during the high power phases of flight and the combustion engine as a baseline load of power for the cruise and, and across the rest of the flight. So you get up to 70 percent fuel savings, during that takeoff and climb cycle. And then it levels off toward about 50 percent fuel savings during the cruise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I see. What's the state of the art in some of the metrics on the battery side? We talked a little bit about, well, we didn't talk numbers, but gravimetric specific energy density, both at the cell and the pack level, the cycle life that state of the art batteries are achieving, and the, battery pack cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the, the batteries, so watt hours per kilogram is the metric that we in the industry normally uses to measure the energy density. The target most are aiming for is right around 400 watt hours per kilogram at a pack level. We're not close to that today. When you're looking at the packs today, you're at, right around 200 watt hours per kilogram really depends on your cooling system and where you draw the dotted line on the battery pack itself and what you include as weight versus don't include as kind of wet versus dry weight for the pack. The cells themselves, are, I remember a few years ago seeing cells that were cresting through the 200s of watt hours per kilogram, and then you get folks who are talking about 300, even into the 400 watt hour per kilogram cells. I think I've seen announcements about cells that are even significantly higher than that. Unfortunately, I'm not an expert in the kind of the lab type chemistry that goes into these batteries and the art of understanding where along the long tail of getting from lab into production you are and in measuring the number of years remaining is very challenging. And so it's hard to tell what, like, state of the art for, for the development of new technologies sounds like it's pretty far ahead in these high watt hours per kilogram. I think the reality is the first battery packs that get adopted into market are going to be at a pack level, maybe even sub 200 watt hours per kilogram, when you're looking full scope, full scope weight of the system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And in terms of cycle life and cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Cycle life and cost are, generally tailored depending on what your application are. So if you've got a more exotic cell, a higher power or energy density, it'll probably have a lower cycle life. I've heard some of our industry peers talking about cycle lives less than a thousand cycles. I don't see how that makes a whole lot of economic sense when you have to be replacing the batteries so, so repeatedly. We think that a 2, 000 to 3, 000 cycles, maybe it's 2, 000 full depth discharge, but you're looking at, you know, that might give you 4, 000 or 5, 000 actual flight cycles on a, on a vehicle, that's not unrealistic when you're not working with the most exotic type cells. And from a cost, I think, we're pretty conservative assuming costs are going to be pretty, pretty high, and it's hard to tell what'll come out in full production once you actually get to scale, but being at$500 per kilowatt hour, I think would be a great outcome for the industry if we were able to get there. And, I wouldn't be surprised if the very first battery packs that came to market were quite a, maybe a multiple higher than that. So maybe a thousand dollars per kilowatt hour. Which gets pretty expensive, especially when you're looking at the very large packs for, for the fully electric vehicles, but is still somewhat manageable with the, with the hybrid electric approach.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to put some business perspective into the conversation and if we use, uh, maybe we can get to ultimately the use case that you are pursuing at Ampaire, but one of the common near term use cases for electric aircraft is often thought of on the conventional side as a flight school trainer aircraft. Now, putting aside that the current range restrictions do not enable flight schools to use electric aircraft for the entirety of the curriculum for flight training, but for most, missions, it's good enough. What I'm interested in is when you actually go down into the weeds that you've been in, how the business case for an electric, fully battery powered aircraft pencils out when you consider the fact that, conventional piston engines are an industry that's been around for decades, benefiting from huge economies of scale, exceptional safety records, it's in the several thousands annual units, a lot of the development and R&amp; D costs have been recovered already. I mean, you're going after a relatively low cost. And I think the engine, replacement on, in this type application is in the 30, 40, 50. maybe 70, 000 per engine, correct me guys, uh, if I'm off. Uh, but at any rate, uh, you have that on the one hand, and then you have an electric, aircraft with a motor that, needs to recover the certification costs and development costs, and is one that every, you know, thousand cycles needs to replace the battery, which can be, I don't know, 80, 000 or whatever the cost is. So when you bake all of these different things, does it really become an attractive option?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So this gets back to your first question around what might the industry disagree with me on, and it is this principle that the economics must make sense in order for people to adopt the products. There are a lot of people out there who assume government subsidies will get us there, or people willing to pay a green premium. And while certain cases that might be true, to hit the scale of adoption that's required, you can't achieve it without really compelling economic benefits for the end user and buyer. So this example that you gave around the, the training, especially in these smaller airplanes, is a great one. The market makes so much sense. The direct operating cost seems so low when you're only taking into account the industrial power that you're using. It's cents on the dollar for OpEx. But when you look whole scale and you're comparing yourself against a, sub 100, 000 airplane with relatively low cost of capital, it's probably fully depreciated, and you're comparing that to a quarter million dollar new build plane that has these unknowns around the cost of batteries over time, or the cost of the infrastructure to charge. The economics are really called into question, especially before you get to full scale. And I think that's, rightly should be acknowledged as one of the big risks for adoption. The performance of the systems, especially in training, I think a blended fleet where, cross country flights might have to be in a hybrid or combustion, but fully electric can be done for the, a few touch and goes here or there, or just familiarization. That's, I think that's completely reasonable to solve the problem. But the economics, especially in smaller airplanes, are pretty challenging. When you look at the economics as you scale to larger planes, it similarly, anywhere that it's not an operator of, high frequency becomes challenging because to earn back the capital cost of the system, you really need high utilization. And, you're not generally going against an option which is a premium priced combustion versus a premium priced electric. It's probably a relatively low cost combustion versus a premium priced electric, and I think that will be a friction point for adoption for those types of applications.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, if you were to argue for a fully battery electric aircraft, what is the right initial use case that will generate this flywheel moment where it makes sense and it also is a good path to get to scale, which will have benefits down the road with economies of scale and the supply chain, et cetera, et cetera. What use case gets the industry going, if not flight training.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think the use case that gets the electrification industry going is using those technologies in full scale applications. So it's taking the exact same batteries, the motors, the power electronics, These certification bases, taking those and by applying them into the hybrid electric applications, you build the industry base. You build the production volumes. You solve those economic challenges tied in with the supply chain and the certification and the market's readiness to adopt. Tying in with the economics of the full scope view, you start to bring those costs down to a point where all of a sudden those same technologies, those same suppliers that are making batteries for the hybrid or making motors for the hybrid, when the economics of scale get to a point, those same suppliers will be the supply base for the fully electric applications where, the opportunities are vast for, where you might want to fly a fully electric plane, whether it's short hop island hopping for commercial cargo flights, commercial drones, or for eVTOL cargo, or for pilot training. There are a lot of areas where you might want the fully electric. And I think the way to get the industry to scale is by scaling the underlying components rather than scaling the end solution of fully electric. And that's when I talk about hybrid as this gateway technology, I truly believe I'm helping all the electric, maybe even helping some hydrogen out there. Like because we're maturing the industry, we're maturing the supply base and we're getting up to good economics, full scale marketability of these underlying technologies that ultimately can be packaged in the fully electric. And that's I think that's how you get there. In eight and a half years of every waking and sleeping moment thinking about it, this is the pathway that makes sense to me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We just had Rob Britton on a couple weeks ago, our last podcast, and he was talking about regional air mobility, and he was saying that it's conceivable that hybrid or electric aircraft will allow us to be able to get to locations that today are less profitable than using a purely combustion engine aircraft. Talk a little bit about that. I'm guessing that hybrid would be the only solution today, although he did mention, I believe, guys, a 30 passenger electric plane as a potential solution in the near future. But talk about the capabilities for hybrid electric for regional air mobility. What's the near term, long term solution from your perspective, Kevin?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I really enjoyed listening to the episode with Rob and his enthusiasm for regional hybrid electric. You can hear it coming through in the conversation. Love it. And the folks over at Heart who you mentioned a few times, you know doing some really interesting work in trying to open up the regional space. Also in that episode, he had mentioned that this regional space is kind of eroded over the years. I mean, with deregulation and things having to compete just on the economics, economics really didn't make sense to serve a lot of secondary or tertiary markets. And so the service to those markets has gone away. And, that demand still exists, it's just being served by ground transportation, people jumping in their cars instead of flying. If you were able to give an economic alternative, lower cost of operation, being the key adoption driver, then people would potentially choose to fly those routes instead of drive those routes. And I think he was spot on with that and the enthusiasm around regional air mobility. Two areas that I would disagree with the approach, though. One is there's a phenomenal difference between a 19 passenger plane and a 20 passenger plane. While it might look almost the same, it is categorically different, in the literal sense of it, is a different category of airplane between Part 23 and Part 33. And the idea that somebody will open up regional air mobility with a Part 25 plane that is something over 20 passengers, I think, is faulty logic there. I don't think it's going to be, Part 25 is not going to be ready for hybrid electric, fully electric, any novel system for quite some time. Now, I want it to be there, and we're certainly helping the industry get there, and there are companies betting their, livelihood on it, but this is where I would disagree with the approach because we believe Part 23 is where it has to start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, explain for the audience the nuances of the differences.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So there are two major categories for conventional airplanes. One category, which is under Part 23 of the regulations, governs all planes up to 19 passengers or the equivalent weight. Part 25 governs all airplanes, 20 passengers and above. And so when regulations are updated in the industry, they're updated for one category or the other, eventually both. The smaller aircraft category, Part 23, is already positioned with all of the legislation and regulation in place to adopt novel propulsion technologies. The larger category is not in that state yet. It takes a decade of work to make a significant change to regulation in aviation. And I think we have years ahead of us before the large aircraft is ready to adopt novel propulsion technology from a regulatory standpoint. The technology might be there, but I think the regulations are going to lag in that case. So entering market with Part 23, or airplanes that are up to 19 passengers, I think is the fastest way, and frankly the only way we will see commercial adoption this decade. And that maybe in the next decade we'll see, through the proof points of these Part 23 smaller airplanes, we will see that technology leapfrog up into and enable the conversion of those certifications requirements in the larger Part 25 airplanes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Speaking of regional air mobility, wanted to get your thoughts on whether you think that electric aviation is what catalyzes regional air travel, or is there a, simply a thickness of the demand that's an issue that needs to be addressed somehow first. You know, we can take a brief look at history prior to the 1978 deregulation, point to point was the, airline network model, and regional travel was subsidized by the government mostly. Post deregulation, we saw the emergence of hub and spoke and a lot of regional routes were abandoned because they did not make economic sense anymore. So you can look at that to draw the conclusion that, well, actually the demand is there is just a matter of making that air travel economic. And so, that's an argument for the technology's role in disrupting, again, this, segment of the industry. If that's the case, well, first of all, do you think that's the case? And then second of all, do you think that electric aviation is the technology that will make economics appealing or you need to start layering additional things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I absolutely think, electrification is the pathway to making the economics make sense. And the improved economics drives this elasticity, this growth in the market. where we will see increased frequencies on the existing routes, decreased ticket costs as competition goes up on those, and increased accessibility or flights to fringe airports, either in a hub and spoke extension or a point to point model that, that allows more people to have access to air travel. I think adoption will also be driven by in similar economic driver but through cargo. I think the cargo market will be a rapid adopter of good economics and will be serving maybe even before the passengers choose to fly to these areas. Same day and next day delivery of packages is a growing expectation for our global economy and I think that what we'll see is as the economics improve the cargo operators, so, think your, your FedEx's, UPS's, DHL's, and similar around the world are going to be adopting these both to serve the high end communities who, want their Amazon packages in the next day, but also to open up these billion people markets that don't currently have access to the global economy efficiently, whether that's moving agricultural goods or other products, the economic drivers of increasing accessibility for them. So it's not just about U. S. states and cities. I do actually think on the global scale, these economics open up countries, entire regions of the world that are currently isolated from the global aviation ecosystem and economy. And when you look at that as a driver for scale, it's not about you know, 10 percent increase in the people who want to fly to Fresno. It's about a going from a market of zero to a market of again, hundreds of millions of people being served for the first time ever and what that drives. And so I wholeheartedly think that the economics of electrification is what gets us there. It is also on those principles that I think some of the exciting features aren't necessary to get us there. So vertical takeoff and landing, important in some areas, but probably not important for the vast majority. Fully electric and important and beneficial, but not useful if you can't land on that dirt strip in Kenya. Like, you have to have full flexibility, and this is part of the reason why I have such conviction around the regional air mobility being opened up through hybridization, where we don't have any of those infrastructure, range or operational limitations, but give that great economic benefit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Kevin, let's say we had a Part 23 aircraft and we wanted to be able to get more aircraft to cities that are not being well served today. And you're saying Part 23 was the way we'd have to do it today. What's the cost per available seat mile for a conventional aircraft, hybrid and electric? Assuming the three of them, could meet that capability today, what's the relative cost difference between the three?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the difference in CASM between conventional and hybrid, we're looking at really depends on, on exactly how you're operating the plane, right? So it's going to be a range. We're looking at a 20 to 40% savings on your cost per available seat mile. So think, again, depends on how you're flying the plane, going from a dollar per available seat mile down to, 70 cents or there's 60 some odd cents per available seat mile. that kind of a transition in certain cases. Electric's harder because right now when I run the numbers, depends on how you assume battery costs, because batteries are the big replacement cost there, but the, right now it does not in my mind, close economically to go fully electric. Also, it's hard to do the analysis because most of the routes you can't even operate. And then the question comes in on, do I count the grid infrastructure upgrade costs and capex and costs of that capital over time in the analysis, or do I not? So it gets a bit muddy. I don't have numbers specifically on the electric in isolation, for those reasons.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you talked to airlines, who today say those routes are not profitable because of the traditional aircraft? Have you talked to them about your operating costs? Are they saying, if you can get me a 30 to 35 percent reduction, that's a route that becomes profitable?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Yeah, the numbers I just talked about are from a very specific model with a very specific airline that I can't mention the names of, but yes, we get into the weeds with our customers and look at their actual operations, their actual frequencies, and how they actually fly the planes. And look at holistic costs, because it's not just about how many miles or hours you fly, it's about pilot costs, it's about outstation staffing, it's about infrastructure upgrades, and if you're serious about this, you need to look holistically at every, down to what is the interest rate on the loan that you take out in order to, or the financing that you get in order to buy the system in the first place. Like there are, all the holistic view on the economics, and making sure that is, economically positive for our customers is how we get through it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I really want to underline the holistic approach because I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. There's a lot of enthusiasm about quoting direct operating cost reductions with electrification, but if you look at it in the context of regional air mobility, where you're really competing with cars and rail and when you are accepting the fact that electric motors are not in their prime time to address this need today, and you start talking about, okay, well, what really do customers care about other than price? They care about frequency and the reliability of the schedule. And that means that you have to be able to, honor a, a service that will be available in all kinds of weather or most weather. So now you start talking about IFR capability and now you start introducing IFR reserves on top of an already small range budget. And it's only when you look at things holistically like that, do you really get a clear perspective on, okay, how really competitive is electric aviation in this particular use case today or over the next couple of years. And I think that, you know, there needs to be a little bit more realism.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I agree, because I think that realism is going to be what builds credibility. It's what enables adoption, it's what enables all of these other factors, many of which we haven't even touched on, whether it's the insurance companies or the lessors, we have to worry about residual values. the holistic view is the only way you actually get a full ecosystem to buy in. And, I just recently had a deep dive with one of our major customers, on IFR, speed, and Flight into Known Icing conditions, because these are the realities of their operation. And we need to know, hey, if we choose to fly five knots faster or five knots slower, what are the repercussions? If we are, like, flying, like, guaranteeing IFR, or if we are, if, what happens if you're not flight into known icing conditions? You're hardly useful, because it's not just Alaska where you have to deal with icing, right? It's everywhere that you have to be confident in your aircraft's ability to operate. Otherwise these mission critical operations have to ground the plane. And if you ground a plane in one of these operations, it destroys a whole network. It has a residual ripple effect through the operations, until recovered. So, so it's important to have these capabilities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So here's a thought, Kevin. What if after all is said and done, the, 30, 40, 50 percent improvement really becomes something more like 10 percent? I'm talking hypothetically here, right? At what point does it make more sense to incrementally improve the efficiency of a turboprop or a conventional aircraft that is certified, well known, all of those things, and perhaps kickstart the electrification supply chain on the unmanned side of things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It makes a lot of sense to, to find wherever you can build the efficiencies into the operation. from the airframe design, there's some folks out there who, with traditional engines, are looking at cutting 30 to 50 percent of the fuel burn out of your 7 37 class planes by bringing, blended wing body type airplanes to market. So there, there are ways that you can, by creating a new aircraft, even if you're not changing propulsion, you can get some meaningful efficiency gains as well. At the end of the day, when you achieve fewer economic benefits, it reduces the addressable market for the technology. So, or inverting that, for every percent cost that I save, it opens up more and more market opportunities. So, there's a old story in the industry about a major airline that removed a few pages from their in flight brochure to save a few pounds because that mattered, right? And these are fractions of a percent saving. So in your example of saving 10%, still transformative. For many operations. Now, is it going to be as transformative as saving 40? Nowhere close. Will it still be meaningful? Only if it's economically compelling. And so this is where you look at the conversion. You know, so maybe somebody struggles to retrofit their plane, but if you're buying a brand new plane and you get to choose between, CapEx neutral across the two, the combustion or a hybrid, and that hybrid saves 10 percent on your OpEx, you might still go with the hybrid system because economically that still makes sense. So this could be a factor that delays adoption if the economics don't work out. From an unmanned standpoint, we're already seeing from a drones, eVTOL, or like a Department of Defense type applications some fully electric, uh, or places where the economics don't matter as much, where you know, they're willing to pay a premium for the mission capability. Those are certainly additional early adopter areas where I think, the industry is likely to get a boost, regardless of the fuel savings, a boost in market applicability because of the performance characteristics of these new vehicle types.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is the drone propulsion supply chain overlapping into the propulsion supply chain that you deal with?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, a year and a half ago, we acquired a company's assets, called, the company was named Talyn and Talyn was developing a, effectively a cargo lift drone, and various types of payloads that it could carry. Our propulsion systems fit straight into that cargo drone, straight into traditional, conventional takeoff and landing drones, or eVTOL, for a whole variety of applications. Ampaire's focus is, again, the disagreement place number one. Propulsion is where you begin, and I want to put propulsion across everything. And, yeah, so the same engine types, I mean, there are flavors and variations of engines, but, the major families are applicable across. across the industry, whether it's manned or unmanned.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, tell us a little bit about Ampaire. How do you make money today? How do you make money in five years and 10 years? What's your special sweet spot?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Ampaire is focused on the electrification of aviation, focused on propulsion, specifically hybrid electric propulsion, upgrading existing aircraft types as an entry point into market and using that as a gateway to transition the industry toward lower carbon and better economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Give examples of the type of aircraft that you're converting. I saw a Skymaster as\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>so back in 2019, we flew our very first aircraft type, which is a upgraded Cessna Skymaster push pull configuration. We call that an independent parallel hybrid architecture, where you have one combustion engine, one fully electric. We've also flown the Cessna Grand Caravan, which is with an integrated parallel hybrid architecture that uses a, mechanically coupled electric and combustion set of engines to be a hybrid electric aircraft. That same engine that goes into the Caravan is what we just finished our CDR on the King Air for integrating there. We've got the Twin Otter is a 19 passenger plane in the same category. And there are thousands of planes in market that use this category of engine. So this is our half megawatt class system. We also have a quarter megawatt class system, which is used as a, either a genset or propulsion system for general aviation, drones, and eVTOLs. Now, as a company where we're focused is around the certification of that launch product and the Caravan. The market that adopts that is both passenger carrying and cargo carrying for the commercial industry, but then also we've got a number of contracts with the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Energy. So our money today, our revenue, which is really just offsetting NRE costs, or non recurring engineering costs. We've brought in about 25 million of government contracts. For these, through these government customers, for the development of our propulsion system and the application of that system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're making$500 million in 5 years, who are your primary customers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we scale commercial revenue, this comes from the regional aviation market. These are folks who are currently buying turboprop engines and would instead of overhauling their engine or buying a new engine, would be buying one of Ampaire's hybrid electric amp drives. These amp drives are the ones which save 50 percent fuel burn, and we believe will save on maintenance cost as well. So it'll be good economics for people to switch over to our systems rather than run on their traditional combustion system, and this is where we see the earliest adoption for technology. So begins as retrofits of the existing fleet of turboprops, but then quickly moves into partnering with OEMs, the aircraft manufacturers, for when they build a new airplane, giving it a hybrid option. The next phase is, of course, working on clean sheet design planes with OEMs who are optimizing planes, new designs, around the novel propulsion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Tell us a little bit about your, you have a great history of being an innovator and entrepreneur. Give us some lessons learned to our innovators who are listening today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, it's been eight and a half years at Ampaire. The number one and biggest recommendation I can give is choose something that you deeply love and that you think you can actually achieve. The days get challenging over the course of years as an entrepreneur. It is not easy. It is oftentimes not even fun. But when you know that you're doing the right thing, when you're tackling the most meaningful, challenging, visible problems that you possibly can, it gives the motivation, not just for you as an individual innovator, but truly, these are things done by teams. And when you have meaningful work, and you're thoughtful about it, it enables you to pull together teams of really great people to go do these audacious things. I think the importance of setting tangible and tractable goals that you can actually achieve in the near term is very important. It's not just about moonshots, it's about the steps on how to get there. And, and ultimately, it's about building long standing relationships and not looking for what do I get now or, being short sighted in them, because truly the world is built by people and, and supported by relationships that are built over years or decades. And so, being a good actor in the industry is so important.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, you've acquired companies, you were almost acquired yourself. What advice would you have for people who might be going through a similar process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so always be open to opportunity and thoughtfully assess it. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the opportunity to go public via SPAC was pretty exciting, and there was a whole lot of money on the table, both from company valuations and from operating budgets. But you also have to be willing to change course when it's clear that the course you're on is not the right one, which we did in early 2022. Ampaire pulled out of a deal to go public because we realized that it was, the higher risk path and it was not worth, continuing down that path of going public and getting acquired. These are hard decisions that you need clarity, you need good advisors and mentors to support you on, and ultimately you need to set the ego aside a lot of times and go on good first principles when making your decisions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, thanks a lot.

Rob has five decades of experience in commercial aviation, and I guarantee regardless of who you are or who you work with, you'll love this discussion. So how to describe this talk? It's a blend of the history and promise of aviation and commercial aviation, the role of hubs and why they started and continue, a reality check on aviation and sustainability, the challenge and opportunities for advanced air mobility with the necessary dash of prudence, and a thorough discussion of regional air mobility. It sounds like a lot, but there's a constant theme, the value and promise of aviation, the power of market forces, the need for innovation and not just in technology with prudent optimism laced through the entire conversation. I had lunch with a few friends last week who loved the podcast. Thanks to you both. And they encourage us to keep the introduction short so our guests can get to the meat of the podcast. So for at least this podcast, we listened. So many thanks to Rob for this uplifting and serious conversation and to our many and growing number of guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Rob Britton as you innovate profitably in The Vertical Space.

Thank you for inviting me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>First question. Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I think that I, because I've been around for so many years, most of my perspectives are fairly well aligned with the industry. I think the one place that sort of jumps to mind, and I'm not sure that it's a disagreement necessarily. I think the industry, is, with respect to, sustainability, climate change, emissions, all that stuff. I think the industry, fails to, in their zeal to talk about how, what they're doing with SAF and what they're doing with, fuel cells and all this other stuff. I think that they really fail to tell what I think of as the balanced story and the way that I would explain what I think of as a balanced story, I is this way when I'm in the business school classroom and I, that's where I spend a lot of my life and I give a lecture, particularly when I'm in Europe, and inevitably in Europe, somebody's going to ask me about climate change and airlines, and they may even be quite pointed about it. and I always like to say it this way. I start out and I say, look, commercial aviation is responsible for two to three percent of climate change and gas emissions. It's not 20 percent. It's not 10 percent. It's two to three. Now that's a small percent, but it's a big number, and nobody's in denial. But what, I like to say is I like to think of it in cost benefit terms. Okay, if we own up To 2 3 percent responsibility for climate change gas. What do we get? And the answer is we get an enormous amount of good. Both in terms of all the great things that commercial aviation enables, whether it's adding value to other economic sectors, allowing businesses to grow, providing a foundation for tourism. All of these, all these things. And I think if you frame it in those terms, it's a good way to frame it and I think that the industry seldom kind of puts it in that direction, I think largely because they're trying to put a happy face on it. And I would rather put an honest face on it to say, okay, yes, we own that, we're trying to make it better, but at the same time, we're adding enormous amounts of good and people want to fly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, what is it about the narrative that you're hearing from airlines that is particularly maybe frustrating is a heavy word, I agree with your point we've poked around this topic in our previous episodes, talking about, whether the allocation of capital towards that goal is really going at the right places and will have the desired outcome when you consider the 2 to 3 percent overall, but also when you double click on it and see, what segments of the market are responsible for most of the emissions. And then you end up with a, 15 percent of a 2. 5% Type of problem on and on. So, so that's one side of the conversation, but the airlines are entities that have been around for a long time. They're smart people. They know the business yet sometimes feel the narrative is out of touch with reality. How do you explain\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, it's a great point and a great question, Luka, and I think you're right. It does seem to be a little bit, out of touch. and I think what my basic complaint about the way they frame it up is that, it's all this sort of, fluffy good news, and nobody's really willing to, put some caveats around it. I'm a, I'm a believer in honesty and I think somebody should You know, I think the airline industry needs to say, yeah, we're, we believe in SAF, but let's be honest. It's not scalable at this point. Right. And even if it were scalable, it's going to be expensive. And so, I think a more forthright discussion, at least in some circles, I mean, they don't have to do it, Scott Kirby doesn't have to talk about that when he's making a presentation to the Sierra Club, right? But at some point, there's got to be, I think, a greater amount of honesty, in the debate. whether we're talking about alternative, whatever it is we're talking about, alternative fuels or, whatever else is going on. And, I mean, at the end of the day I think where I, when I really get pushed into the corner, as I would be, for example, if I'm in front of a bunch of students in Sweden, right, home of Greta Thunberg, if I'm really pushed against it, You know, I start to rail about this idea that it's okay for them to fly, right, if they live in Stockholm, and in December and January it's cold and dark and wet. It's okay for them to go to the Dominican Republic to go on the beach, but somehow it's not okay for, a family in India that has just become middle class to take a journey. And so, I'm wavering a little bit, but I get really cranky about this because I think at the end of the day there's a lot of hypocrisy that surrounds all of what we're talking about here. So all I'm saying is let's get rid of the hypocrisy. Let's get rid of the fluff and let's have honest discussion about what we need to do. Now, having said all that, I mean, the arc of things, as an optimist, and I've been an optimist all my life, the arc of things is moving in the right direction. I mean, people are doing the right things. And Luka, you rightly point out, when it comes to capital allocation, that sort of thing. I mean, it's not a perfect world, but we're sort of, maybe it's not correct to say we're moving in the right direction, but we seem to be lurching in the right direction.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Another thing that we brought up in the past in the podcast is that it feels like the airlines are under pressure to innovate where in fact they are the users and the operators of the technology. Do you see that as well from your perspective, right? People are pointing fingers at airlines and say, well, what about this new, more efficient, aircraft or propulsion system Where in fact, they should be turning to the Prats and the, Rolls of the world. Right. And the same, well, what do you have that I can use so that, we can address some of\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I agree with that completely. Yeah, I mean, I think, I agree with you. I think that's a, I think that's a solid point, Luka, but I, in, in the end, it's one of those things where if an airline were to do that, they would end up just getting dragged through the mud. I, so I think that, it's the sort of sense that, we're all in it together, I think is where we need to be. And that, again, that's, one of the points that I always make. to my students, and that is that everyone in the commercial aviation ecosystem understands what needs to be done. No one is in denial. there's nobody that says, this is not an issue. This is not a problem. And so, we all collectively own the problem, but you're exactly right. The people who are distinctly in a position to fix the problem are the people that manufacture engines, and to a lesser extent, are the people that make airframes. and, I mean, and I want to be sympathetic to them because I think, they're working on all these things. But in the background of all this is what I keep saying, and that is people want to fly. And, if you look at, sometimes I see these sorts of, these sorts of interesting collision courses, if we take, the global scale, I look at, the, I look at the, the order announcements At Farnborough last month, for example, and Indigo, in India, I don't know, it's, I lose track of how many hundreds of airplanes they have on order, but that's the reality, right? India is emerging. People are become more and more Indian people are becoming middle class. Their business sector is sort of growing in spite of itself. and people want to fly. And so what we're going to say to them, no, you can't. yeah. I said, anyway, beaten that horse to death, but it is, it's something that I feel really passionate about in that. And so, come back to answering your first question. I think that's what I would say. I think I have a slightly different, maybe not slightly, maybe a fairly significantly different take on the discussion around sustainability and, and climate change.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. and Rob, I would say that this is also, we talked about, oh, it's a propulsion problem. It's an airframe problem. That's where the work needs to be done. I would say it may well boil down to being a petrochemical problem because the most effective path to actually achieving this goal, if that's what people want to do, is to be able to preserve all the existing training, all the existing airframes and create a fuel in a new way that works directly in those systems starting tomorrow. And in that case, then, it's a petrochemical problem and it's, it's those people that we need at the table doing this. And then, oh, by the way, if we solve that, if we find a way to create a sustainable, renewable liquid hydrocarbon fuel, especially if we do it without bio based feedstocks. We're doing it from electricity and water and a carbon source. Well, and that's way bigger than just SAF. That is a new energy storage medium and an extremely powerful one, and one that's so differentiated from batteries that we have anchored ourselves to with the entire renewable energy matrix. That would be literally a massive step forward for civilization if we could do that cost effectively and\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It would. And I've, and again, in keeping with my, my, my realism, but sunny optimism, I think that, we are, everything that I read, and I'm not a, I'm not a physicist, but everything that I read is that, the research is very close on, for example, to being able to sustain a controllable fusion reaction and be able to then take that and scale it up. And if that's, I don't know, I'd love to see it in my lifetime. I'm 72. if it happens in my lifetime, I'll be dancing in the streets. but, if we have a time frame that says it's 20 years off or 30 years off, I think absolutely those kinds of breakthroughs are doable in that sense, whether it's a fusion reactor that generates enormous, virtually unlimited amounts of hydrogen, or it's a breakthrough with other kinds of energy sources that will not, add enormous amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere. Let's bring it on. and, there's, it's clear to me that lots and lots of people, way smarter than us are working on this. And the more that we do, the better and the closer we'll be. So I think, we'll get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Your answer to the opening question is, let's have some realism with some sunny optimism, and let's understand the value that aviation is providing. Let's start the answer to sustainability of, let's first of all remember that these are the things we do for society. That you all take advantage of and they play a very important role while understanding that sustainability is something we, we're only two to 3%, but we're focused on it, but it's not something that's gonna happen tomorrow, but you want a balanced, realistic approach while answering the question. That's frankly a little refreshing. So is there anything else you want to talk about on this topic before we move to the next\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I, I think now, I think the only last thing that I would say is the other thing that makes me absolutely crazy, is when we're singled out, right? When we're thought to be, the only evil polluters that exist in the world. I teach a lot in, I teach a lot in Switzerland, and as they have an enormous dairy industry, right? And as you also know, the world's cattle, have about a 5x impact it's somewhere around 10 percent of climate changing gas, largely from methane that the cows burp. But nobody's going after, the dairy farmer, right? I mean, they are to a, to be fair, there, there are some, green extremists in the Netherlands, which also, they also have a large, dairy industry that are going at this. But I don't want to be singled out. I don't want to be held to be the only evil people around. And particularly in, in the US marketplace where, people still seem to be more than happy to buy enormous pickup trucks, right? And just so you know, we've got a Ford Escape Hybrid that gets 46 miles to the gallon. I ride that bicycle to the grocery store. So, we can't be singled out, and we've got to get back to what you so eloquently say, Jim, and that is this idea of all of this good, and I think to maybe wind this up, that's the part of the story that we're not telling. All of this good.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We should have an episode on those bastard cows, coming out.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what I always say, what I always say to people is, I love milk.

Let's figure out a way to, to redo their biology so they don't burp methane. And we can probably do that in 10 or 20 years, right?

But Rob, give us a perspective, in order to predict what we should be doing in the future we want to understand the past a little bit more. Give us a history of the airline industry, just from a historical overview and lessons that you think may apply\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's great, and I'm looking forward to this little history lesson, if you will. So, I mean, and the thing that's interesting about the airline business, and in fact I was teaching this morning, at Georgetown, where I work part time, and I had to explain that it was a group of MBA students, and I had to explain to them that the airline industry, for the first 50 or 60 years of its existence here in the United States and other parts, will look very different from what it looks like today. So here in America, as you guys know, at the dawn of commercial aviation, in order to stimulate the growth of this new technology, the federal government handed out contracts to carry mail by air and then that slowly worked towards carrying people. And somewhere in the late 1920s was the first effort to create a, essentially, a regulated utility model for the airline industry. They were not going to allow the market to do that to make decisions. So what emerged from the Civil Aeronautics Act in whatever it was 1927 or 28 modified through the 1930s was a regulatory regime that was not just operational regulation but economic regulation. And so for 50 years until 1978, a group of lawyers in Washington made all of the commercial decisions for the airline industry. Most fundamentally, could you start an airline? And the answer was almost always no. So they regulated the most fundamental aspect of the business, and that was market entry. Once you were lucky enough to be licensed to be an airline then the federal government, through these lawyers in the Civil Aeronautics Board, which was the name of the entity, told you where you could fly. And so they doled out, essentially, you could think of them as route licenses, right? And those licenses were doled out to two different types of airlines. There were the so called trunk airlines the remaining survivors are American, Delta, and United, but back in the old days there were brands like Eastern, and National, and Continental, and Northwest, and a whole bunch of them. There were the trunk airlines that carried people longer distances, so from Chicago to San Francisco, or from New York to Boston, just from New York to Miami. And then there was a whole network. Fascinating, vast network of what were called local service airlines. And these were brands like I grew up with in Minnesota, North Central Airlines, or it could be West Coast out on the Pacific Northwest, or it could be Allegheny. Or it could be Piedmont, or it could be Ozark, these kind of funky regional names. And these were companies with smaller aircraft serving smaller markets, generally with a nice subsidy from the federal government. So this Civil Aeronautics Board controlled licensing. Once you were licensed, they controlled routes. Sometimes in the case of local routes, and we're probably going to talk about regional mobility sometime in the podcast. So there was a handsome subsidy that, for example, North Central Airlines collected from the federal government to operate a route from Minneapolis St. Paul to Brainerd, Minnesota, to Bemidji, Minnesota, to International Falls. Small communities, 8, 000 people, 9, 000 people. And this network of these local service airlines really, you can, there's a fascinating map that I actually have on my computer, which I could, if you remind me, I'll share with you. That showed you this vast network. So they doled out market entry, they doled out the routes, they doled out the frequency, so they control supply. If you were given what was called, it wasn't really a license, it was called a route award. If you won the route award for new service from say Minneapolis, St. Paul to Denver, which North Central Airlines got that route award in around 1969, the government told you how many flights, not the marketplace says, there's demand for six flights and we're going to meet the marketplace demand. But the government said, we think it's three. And that's what North Central got. They got three flights a day from Minneapolis, St. Paul to Denver. And they were, of course, happy to have the route, because the, the previous incumbent Western Airlines, now part of Delta, had no competition. So they were, they nibbled a little bit toward the end in the period, sort of roughly 1965 to 1978, with a little bit of gentle competition. But the last thing that they controlled, the fourth thing that they controlled, was price. And they set price in a very interesting and comfortable way if you were a producer. They basically set price at whatever the average cost of production would be, plus a guaranteed profit. So for years, the mantra at the Civil Aeronautics Board was I believe that they were going to set fair levels at a point that would produce a 12 percent return on assets, right? it was just bizarre. And so what, so if, and the, and All of that fair setting was done against average cost of production. So if you figured out, if you were a bright guy and you figured out how could I produce this product, Below the average cost of production, you made your investors very happy. And in fact, interestingly enough, cause I come from Minneapolis, St. Paul, that's exactly the model that Northwest Airlines for years pursued. Now they were very clever about that because the long time CEO, this is maybe more detailed than your listeners want, you can just edit it out, but the long time, here's the fun thing, the long time CEO of Northwest Airlines was a guy named Donald W. Nyrup. I actually knew his son quite well. Don Nyrup's previous job, before he became head of Northwest Airlines, was he was a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board. So he, this is classic revolving door, right? He knew exactly how all this worked. And he said, if if I can produce the product cheaper than anybody else, my investors are going to be really happy. And that was exactly the model that they pursued for a long time. So even, with that idea of average cost of production and a nice, built in cushion, companies still found themselves in financial trouble. They couldn't manage the business. And so, for example, in the, I believe, late 1960s, the CAB, went out and engineered, by leaning on Delta, engineered Delta's acquisition of an airline called Northeast. Northeast was on the verge of running out of cash and they said they need help. And, Delta takes over. And there were a couple of other episodes that were like that, in that. So, so this whole thing is micromanaged by a bunch of lawyers on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D. C. And there was this enormous, I mean it was a big, they took up the whole building. And there was, they had economists and they had all kinds of other people, and obviously an army of lawyers and they, this, all of this, all this whole thing set up to make the decisions that would normally be made in the marketplace.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And who were some of the more successful airlines\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I've already mentioned, I've already mentioned Northwest. Northwest was a good one, a Continental. did very well through most of their, through most of their years. Delta was always very astutely managed. and had, they really had a, very, the government basically gave them a very nice route network. So those are sort of three that, three that, that come to mind. So what happens over 50 or 60 years of intrusive government economic regulation? Well, Costs just keep going up and up because there's no competition. There's no Southwest or JetBlue or Spirit placing downward pressure. And all of the older companies, more or less have the same cost structure.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, it's remarkable that this economic regulation of air travel got put in place so early in the infancy of the industry. And my question is, what was the motivation for that? Who was advocating for this economic regulation? Was this coming from the airlines themselves? Was this to protect their profits? Or was this coming from the government? Or was this just an outgrowth of how society thought about regulation at that point in the 20th century?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The principal issue at hand was in the 1920s and even into the 30s, the planes were falling out of the sky and it was not the safe industry that we, the astonishingly safe industry that we have today. And so the impetus for regulation originally was all driven around safety. And the logic that was able to be sold to politicians in Washington, to the media, to the person in the street, the man or woman in the street, was if we allow the market to decide, if we allow competition in this industry, some company is going to get into financial trouble and they're going to cut corners on maintenance. They're going to cut corners on pilot training and the plane is going to crash and everyone's going to die. That was the kind of logic of the 1920s. Then what happens in October 1929, the stock market crashes and there's this massive meltdown and there's this massive, through the early 1930s, loss of confidence in the genius of the market economy, right, and the, suddenly the market economy is no longer able, the skepticism, both, driven from FDR or whoever else it is, even from, for that matter, moderate Republicans are saying, they can't, we, the marketplace is a good place to be, but it's not perfect. And so certain industries are going to need to be controlled. And so that actually added a layer of legitimacy to this whole regulatory, impetus and it just carried on. And so what's happening? So costs are going up, prices are going up, costs are going up, prices are going up. And essentially the, the reality was, as I said, all of the older airlines, whether they were in the, local service category, Piedmont and Ozark and North Central. Or they were in the trunk category, National and TWA and Western, whoever they were. All of them more or less have, in a range, the same cost structure. Their costs are all going up sort of in lockstep. And so when their costs go up, for example, when the pilots union, and as you know, unions have been a reality in, in, in the transport sector in general, and in, in aviation in particular for decades, the pilots union at United, let's say as an example, in the, 1950s, say, we need a new contract we want to raise. United's management just gave it to them because they knew that they knew two things. First of all they had to do was go to Washington and say our costs just went up. You need to raise fare levels. That was reason one. Reason two was they knew about pattern bargaining. The same reality that exists in automobile manufacturers. When the UAW gets a contract at GM, they take it to Ford. Ford. They take it to Stellantis, and off they go. So the United Pilots knew that the Airline Pilots Association, once they got a deal at United, they were going to shop it to every other airline management group, and all, it goes up and up and up. Then what happens? Boom! Mid 1970s, a nice boom, actually. Mid 1970s, a group of influential economists, led by Professor Alfred Kahn from Cornell University, travel down to Washington, and they say, they meet with the Civil Aeronautics Board, don't get much response. They go up to Capitol Hill, and they say, this is nuts. The technology has been perfected, flying has become safe, planes are basically not crashing anymore, and this mode of transportation, which has essentially been perfected, is available only to the rich. Guys, I've been in this business for 55 years. I started in 1969. as a travel agent to pay for college. My parents were broke and I had to pay for it myself. I was a traveler. When I went out to Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport, the only people I saw at the airport were the well to do. So Alfred Kahn says to the Congress, to whoever will listen, if you deregulate the airline industry and you allow competition to come in, prices will come down and more people will be able to travel. So the impetus was entirely pro consumer. And that's exactly what happened. That's exactly what happened. And so the Airline Deregulation Act is passed on October 24th, 1978, all of this intrusive government regulation starts getting phased out. There's open entry into the industry, provided that of course, you satisfy the basic operational requirements. You get a license to operate. And new airlines are starting up. Routes are opened up. Prices are opened up. Prices and fares immediately come down.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, do you think that early period of economic regulation of air travel was unnecessary? Was it a mistake? Could they have started with regulating safety but not routes and ticket prices?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes, I fervent looking back basically on what I know. They could have created a operational regulatory regime that said, here's what you need to do and then put some teeth into it. That if you fail to do this If you fail to do this and you have an accident that turns out to be traceable back to your negligence, you lose your license. Easy as that, right? So, we can't, you wish that you would have had that kind of mentality. And by the way, guys, as this was not just in the United States. This was global. In fact, it was even, in a very real sense, it was even more intrusive than most of the rest of the world, because the model of the rest of the world was state ownership of the carriers. Now, there is a bad idea, right? Let's put government in charge of Air France or The predecessor of British Airways or just about any airline in the world. But, so it's a great, I mean, I love the musing about, what would have happened and how we would have had far less pain than we have today. Because what has essentially happened since 1978 has been an enormous amount of pain, variably defined, visited upon the older airlines. Because they have, in order to survive have had to figure out a way to lever their costs down in order to get, into a situation that sort of approaches equilibrium with the new players that are coming into the industry. And as you guys know, that lever has mainly been Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which is a very blunt instrument, painful for the workers, painful for retirees, but it has allowed the older airlines, the three remaining older airlines to survive and, to get on with their business. But the fruits of this were evident from the beginning. I mean, you could go back, to the early, late 1970s, early 1980s, and you could see, and I was around back then, and you could, I, you'd see a full page advertisement, in the New York Times for People Express, one of very bold start up carrier saying, we're going to fly you for 59 peak and 39 off peak and people are going, wow, this is really great. And so it has been a remarkable achievement. A democratizing a mode of transport that was only available to the wealthy. And I'll tell you guys to put a sort of a fine personal point on it. I think that reality for me spending my career in the airline industry, that's been to me the most satisfying aspect working for 50 years in and near airlines is that we have made it possible for everyone to fly. We're cheaper than the Greyhound, we're cheaper than Amtrak, and now people can fly. And isn't that a great thing?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to ask you a question about deregulation, but before, I'd like to rewind a little bit and ask whether there were any milestones in the pre deregulation days that you think is worthwhile to call out, whether this is the emergence of the jet age or the point at which air travel became a mass market, perhaps when the contours of today's hub and spoke model\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>35:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, well, there's no question that the advent of a jet powered aircraft, with turbine engines that are far more reliable than, than piston engines, was an enormous breakthrough. And so that dating to, 1958 and being perfected then on and through the early to mid to late sixties with not just, new bigger airplanes like DC 8s and 707s flying, but, the emergence of, smaller jet aircraft that could serve smaller communities. That was, that was a huge breakthrough, from a technological standpoint. and there were probably, there were, not probably, there were certainly, smaller, more subtle, things that changed along the way. I mean, I, one of the, one of the things that we sort of, we take for granted today, is, is the emergence of much better weather forecasting, and just, think about that weather forecasting that was really the methodologies and to a certain extent, the technologies that, that were developed during World War II, particularly in, in the European theater of operations, to allow, good weather forecast to enable the B 25s and B 29s to, to bomb strategic targets in, in Germany. So all of that stuff, right, that found its way into the civilian sector. In fact, one of the great early adopters of that technology, that wartime technology was actually, my hometown airline, Northwest. They had a meteorology department, in the late 1940s, that was the envy of the airline industry. They were like, we're on top of this and, we're going to figure this out. So there were those\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And that was the envy of the industry until they merged with Delta. They always had a premier weather forecasting capability. With meteorologists,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Brilliant. Yeah. And, so there were those kinds of things. Now, over on the economic side, I mean, I think it's worth calling out so that I don't sound like I'm, dumping, just enormous amounts of, of bad stuff on the Civil Aeronautics Board. There were people that were around back then that saw what was going on. People like Will Rist, for example, America's former Government Affairs Senior VP. There, there were people at the CAB. as early as the 1960s, mid 1960s, late 1960s, through the early and mid 1970s, they could kind of see that this was a little bit silly. And they could kind of see that maybe we should allow, maybe we should tinker around a little bit with some experimentation. But It was really just nibbling around. So, you had the emergence, I mean, this is going to sound incredibly quaint to us in, in, in 2024, but, we, you had the emergence of family fares, right? Where, husband and wife, and of course it was a traditional nuclear family, husband and wife, and the kids could go along and the wife got, a one third discount and the kids flew for half fare and, off they went to Disneyland or, go see the Empire State Building. Again, to make this personal and a little bit fun, I first got smitten with the airline industry when I was a teenager, and around the same time that I was smitten by the industry, the Civil Aeronautics Board allowed airlines to offer what were called Youth Standby Fares. So, I could join, and I did, United Airlines, they called it the 12 to 21 club. You were minimum age 12, maximum age 21. If you were in that age window, you could fly for half fare, standby. You couldn't make a booking, but you could fly standby. Oh, and I flew to a lot of places, for half fare. Flying standby, and we know we got stuck once in a while trying to get home or whatever, but for the most part it worked out. So there was a little bit of nibbling along the way, but, nothing, like the, the, what needed to really be.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At what point do you consider the airline industry became a mass industry and when did the hub and spoke\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, well, it's so, it was so, I mean, I'm being, I'm being a little bit, a little hyperbolic when I say that, in the, 1960s and 70s, the only people that could afford to fly with the wealthy. I mean, middle class people were flying and, travel was increasing, travel as a, as a component of discretionary spending was some, was there, in the, in the, in, in the post war boom, as the economy expanded rapidly, what, what did middle class people do? They, they bought a bigger house, they bought the wife a car, and then, once that was all sort of fixed up, they started to travel, so people were traveling and, and it was becoming, it was on its way, to, to becoming, a mass business. Now, around that time, a number of very forward thinking, not a large number, a small number actually of forward thinking companies started saying maybe within this constraint of the federal government of the Civil Aeronautics Board handing out routes, maybe we could organize a route network in a way that enabled the evolution of the hub. Right. And of course, the pioneer in this was Delta Airlines. I mean, you go down to Atlanta, Hartsfield Jackson Airport today, and you see this massive hub, the biggest one, essentially the biggest one in the world. But that hub, it really existed even in the 1960s, right? And as early as the 1960s, people in the South said, when you die You might go to heaven, or you might go to hell, but you're probably going to get through Atlanta. So they had that idea down, and that's what they had. Now, interestingly, and to be fair, United did a little bit of that hubbing at Chicago and Northwest did a little bit of that hubbing at Minneapolis St. Paul, and Continental did a little bit. Nobody had anything quite as well developed as Delta. Now, fast forward to, October 1978 and the deregulation of routes and the idea that now an airline could configure their routes in a way that made business sense. And the hub and spoke model then emerged very quickly as the way to move people around a geographically vast country. People say to me, why do we have these things? And people oftentimes ask that question living in a place like Chicago or Washington or New York where they can fly non stop to anywhere in the world. But if you live in Medford, Oregon, or Tuscaloosa, Alabama, or Traverse City, Michigan, you don't have a non stop to even to Boston or to San Francisco. And so, the hub and spoke concept became, an enormously sensible way to move people across a geographically vast nation like the lower 48 of the United States. And from across, a place where population was pretty broadly distributed. It was, of course, an urban population, but not everyone lived in big metropolitan centers. You might live in Birmingham, Alabama, or in Portland, Oregon. And if you lived in Birmingham or Portland and you were on your way to Sarasota, Florida, there was probably not an airline that could operate that route, even without the constraints to operate that route, go in and make money. I always like to explain it. I was going to actually bring them up today. I was, because I oftentimes bring props to class and I talk about how hub and spoke airline model is really like two funnels where the narrow end of the funnel faces each other and the hub is in the middle of the funnel. So they're collecting traffic from all over, flights coming in. Say Delta, flights are coming in from the west. And they're landing at Atlanta and they're going off to the east or coming in from the south and going to the north. And these hubs are, for the most part, directional. because that's, logically the way that you would organize. So these things end up working really well,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is it a fair observation that once the government control was removed over routes and fares, with the deregulation act in 1978, the major carriers focused on the most profitable routes, which ended up being these trunk routes. And with easier access to the market, you had this emergence of regional airlines that started with code chairing with major airlines and started connecting smaller communities to these larger hubs. And so, is that a point where we really start to see, the concept of a regional airline emerge, and can you talk about how that segment evolved and how they then later ran into\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's Absolutely right. and so to use an example close to home, before deregulation, so in the old regulated environment, an airline called North Central Airlines based in Minneapolis, St. Paul, operated a route, with subsidy, up to northern Minnesota, up to the smaller communities in northern Minnesota. The subsidies, for the most part, went away with deregulation. There was this thing called the Essential Air Services Provision, which was put in. but for the most part, the, airlines needed to find a new model for collecting people from smaller communities. in the old days when there was, when there were aircraft suited to this and there was in some cases subsidy, in some cases a cost structure that allowed airlines to serve these smaller, that was what happened. Very quickly, a company like Northcentral, which now had the freedom to grow, ended up actually merging with a couple of smaller airlines and became an entity, a brand called Republic. They could no longer, and I was around, this is when I got in the business in 1984 they could no longer serve these points economically, these small communities economically. And so they then began, they then turned to these regional airlines that operated on a franchise model, right? Paint your airplanes to look like ours, sign a contract to conform to service standards. We'll take care of of setting the prices, we'll take care of running the commercial side. You get involved with the operational side. And as in the regional airline ecosystem, there's a bunch of different models for how those companies get paid. But for the most part, nowadays, it's what's called fee per departure where the company, whether it's SkyWest or whomever, Air Wisconsin, they get paid. For every flight they, every flight they run and the airline takes care of collecting all the revenue and managing it. And that model got built out. That model really starts to be built not long after deregulation and in, and in fact, some forward thinking, larger airlines like American with their American Eagle brand, and United, with, I think they called it United Express from the get go, starting to franchise with these independent operators, to provide service to these smaller communities, and the whole thing takes off and, 40 years later, we now have this network, that, has evolved, works pretty well, but, as you guys, as you just suggested, has some problems related to the economics of small jet aircraft related to, the salary structures for these smaller companies, so on and so forth. I, again, my sunny optimism says that, a lot of these issues that were being talked about with a lot of vigor five or eight or 10 years ago, about pilot shortages in the regional sector, are for the most part being sorted out and the way it gets sorted out is by raising their salaries. And these companies are able to do that and continue to provide, the kind of service that people want. So the, in the regional environment, I mean, if you think about, if you think about small cities, small communities, small and medium sized communities in the United States, my sense is that the system works pretty well. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well. And there are just for all I've, while I've got this, there have been a number of different models. that have been tried. I mentioned, the so called essential air services model that the federal government administers, which basically is, for the most part, a failure. To me, when we're talking about regional air service, the most successful model in my view is something called the minimum revenue guarantee. And this concept was actually pioneered in resort towns in the Mountain West that were seeking to have a greater sense of reliable air service. And so I believe that the first resort towns that pursued this is winter resort towns, were Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Vail, Colorado. And this goes back to the late eighties or early nineties, and they contracted with American and American came up with this minimum revenue guarantee concept. They said, well, how much service do you want from where? And they said, well, you know what we want one flight from Dallas, one from Chicago, blah, blah, blah, blah. So American came up with it with a number that they needed, which was basically their costs probably with, and with some baked in profit. And they gave them the number and they said to the resort and it was usually done through a chamber of commerce or a local economic development authority or some either private or public private partnership. They said, look, here's the number. we'll market the flights. We'll sell the flights. And at the end of the year, we'll just do the numbers. And if you meet the revenue threshold, you're golden and if you don't, you write us a check to make us whole. The interesting thing about those, the way those structures are is that, as I recall, the airline didn't give anything back if they wildly exceeded the guarantee. So, and they started, so they started out doing this for tourism destinations, and then they widened it out and, for example, one of the more recent just ordinary communities was a place called Roswell, New Mexico, town of, I don't know, 20,000 people in eastern New Mexico. This goes back about a dozen years, and at that point, rather than American doing it with their mainline, because their, those planes would have been too big, they did it through their Eagle Regional Airline, and it was the same concept they said to the city of Roswell or whoever it was out there that was doing this. Look, here's what we need. And off they went, and it has worked spectacularly well. It's worked so well, in fact, that the initial service pattern was from Roswell East to the big hub in Dallas, Fort Worth. And I believe, and you could check the schedules, but I believe that they've since built it out to it, to have at least one or two flights from Los Angeles of all places. So, here's this little town and the dusty high plains of New Mexico with pretty nice connectivity. That model has been very successful and has in fact been used by a number of other airlines. And just to finish that concept off, you guys may be aware there's actually a number of consulting firms that work with local communities to try to build air service. And this minimum revenue guarantee. concept is just one of the many things that are in their arsenal. And these are both for sort of tourism dependent communities, as well as, as well as just sort of ordinary places. So that's an interesting concept. What I like about it is it's a market based concept. It's not something, where the government's going to come in, where there's going to be a lot of political shenanigans and pork belly, pork barrel stuff. And so it's a nice solution and it has been very successful for the communities that have pursued it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>How prevalent is the use of that mechanism today?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, it's still, and so the other, so carrying that forward, one of the interesting things is that in a number of these, resort communities they started off with the minimum revenue guarantee and they were just able to be weaned off of it because, you know, the market, the route got built up, the service got built up, so on and so forth. In addition to American, I, quite honestly guys, I don't know who else is pursuing it besides, yeah, I'm pretty sure that Alaska Airlines has, I don't know if they're still doing it in the winter from, I believe, Seattle into some of the interior ski destinations in British Columbia, a place called Kamloops, which has a couple of, smaller, but growing ski resorts. And then the other people that are using it, I believe in Canada, in Eastern Canada is Porter. You may know about them, Porter Airlines. they, they're, historically a Q400 operator, but now they've just recently taken delivery of E195s and are building out their service pattern. But Porter was running, I believe, a minimum revenue guarantee into a number of ski resorts in Quebec and in Eastern Canada.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So we talked about regional air travel, how they came to exist, and the kinds of pressures that they have started to feel over the last maybe two decades or so. What's your assessment of the current state of regional air travel, and are you seeing opportunity in new technology, whether this is electric propulsion or increasing autonomy to remove some of the economic pressure that caused the contraction of this segment?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>My sense is that if we think about conventional small jet technology, I think the service patterns that, companies like SkyWest or Air Wisconsin or the owned subsidiaries like Delta's, company Endeavor. That whole thing seems to be fairly stable. And again, I'm, I confess I'm a little bit removed from some of the to and fro on that, but I'm not seeing, for example, in the airline, trade publications, the industry publications like Aviation Week or Aviation Day. I'm not really seeing, people squawking about pilot shortage and so on and so forth. And as I suggested earlier on in the conversation, I think that, a lot of the pilot shortage of 5, 6, 10 years ago was really related to money. Once they've given these guys a raise and a signing bonus, they don't seem to be having much trouble attracting young pilots into the system. And I know for a fact that all of the regionals recruit very heavily in those universities that have ab initio pilot training programs, like the University of North Dakota or the University of Nebraska, Omaha, and. there's a handful of schools that, four year universities that do that. So I think that's, so full stop, let's shift now and, look at the new technology on the horizon. And, even though some of it seems, a bit further out, it's pretty clear that, companies like Heart, Aerospace in Sweden, building out these 30 passenger hybrid, aircraft. I think this is very exciting because my sense and I haven't seen any data, but my sense just maybe in a very simplistic sense as an owner of a hybrid automobile my sense is that the economics of a hybrid aircraft with a, 30 passenger and, I'm sure once they're successful with that, they'll build it up to, 50 is very exciting. And so you've got that as just sort of hybrid propulsion, the, and again, my knowledge of the players is small, but there's, I know that there's a handful of people that are building out, a pure battery solution, in a, in a smaller package. And that stuff, I mean, that's all very exciting because I think that, that will at least start to attack the, fuel related part of operating into small communities with, with RJs. The interesting thing, if we take this sort of long view of regional service, long being say 40 years, if we go back and look at the operating economics of a, of an airplane, like the Saab 340, that was a very economical airplane to operate in terms of fuel burn, 30 passengers, as I recall, something like that, and then, the, the pure jet aircraft that Bombardier was delivering started to come on and Embraer and, you know, all of a sudden those became very popular. But you know, What happens when oil spikes up? A lot of those aircrafts start to get a little bit marginal, especially in the 50 seat range. So, so the new technology, whether hybrid or pure battery, I think will at least address, some of the energy related issues. And if that's addressed and the labor issues are sort of sorted out, then I think, the prospect looks pretty bright. And indeed, depending on, where things go with, with autonomous, operation, you could start to see something looking very attractive in terms of being able to serve smaller communities. I mean, to me, it's not entirely impossible to foresee a regional airline map that looked more like what it did in the regulated period when all that service was so massively subsidized. So that let's say a city of 10 or 15, 000 people in the Great Plains could expect to have connectivity to a major hub.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, do you think that the hybrid or electric capability why should they better serve those communities in the future? If they're profitable routes, today they could be served from a gas turbine engine. Why do they have to be electric or hybrid?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>no, yeah, I'm not, yeah, I'm not sure I was clear enough. No, what I think I was saying is that for example, a hybrid airplane might be able to provide, supplemental service to, a city that has jet service, so imagine, I don't know, I'm going to take an example. Let's take, let's take Bismarck, North Dakota, the capital of North Dakota. They probably enjoy, I haven't, I'm looking at a schedule, but Delta Connection flies to Bismarck, probably four times a day, five times a day from Minneapolis, St. Paul, from their big hub there. Maybe with a hybrid aircraft, they could serve, they could add some trips in the middle of the day. Alternately, there might be the possibility that the attractive, energy economics of these newer, of this new technology might allow a service to places that don't have it today that would very much like to have it. And you could conceive of a combination of what we spoke about a moment ago, a minimum revenue guarantee. So now let's go down to a, a very small city of say 15, 000 people, and maybe it's just an ordinary place. Maybe it's a resort place or a tourism dependent place. Now they could contract with SkyWest or Air Wisconsin or whomever to bring in a 30 passenger hybrid airplane into a very small place. So you might actually see more dots on the map. And again, hard to know where we would be, but at least what I know about the, the potential economics of these things, that would be, that's not infeasible. So I hope, does that help a little bit?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>does, thanks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, has Heart announced what their efficiency gain or operating cost will be for that 30 person aircraft? I mean, I'm curious as what is it relative to like a narrow body jet, like a 737 or an A320, and what is it relative to another 30 person aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I don't know what that is, but I would encourage you to look. I just, I remember about four or five months ago, I was actually, I was teaching over in Europe and somebody mentioned, they said, there's this Swedish company that's working. So I dug it out and I looked very briefly at their website. So I'd encourage you to, they're called Heart Aerospace and they're in Gothenburg, Sweden. and I bet they've got some, I mean, there's probably some promises there, and as you guys know, it's always once the aircraft is in service that where you really see whether it's actually performing to the promised economics, and I could tell you a lot of funny stories about that, in conventional aircraft, but, I suspect it's going to be a pretty significant, efficiency gain and especially vis a vis, anything in that category. And, the problem guys is that basically that 30 passenger, aircraft size has basically gone away. There's nobody, there's almost nobody flying something like that anymore. I mean, there's a couple of small operators that are keeping, Beach 1900s in the air that are about, 20 passengers. So, they might find a niche is\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is it because the market doesn't exist?

I mean, I think that, you could look at the small end of a regional aircraft and there's really nothing there anymore. And so I, I think that they're onto something. With a, with a 30 seat airplane. And I have to believe that they'd, once they prove that they'd build it out to a larger capacity. And if they do that, I think they're going to have economics. it's a turboprop as I understand it. and if it's a speedy turboprop, the block times into a, you know, on a 200 or 300 mile service are going to be pretty comparable to a pure jet.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp>CHAT GPT says it's a 30 percent reduction in operating cost compared to traditional regional jets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, there you have\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>true, then it must be\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, that's exactly right.

Assuming that new technology comes online and now we have electrified aircraft that, lower the cost per flight or a per mile, whatever is more relevant for regional air travel. And, and this value generated for airline, how does the airline get to keep that value? Do we end up in a situation where the business model changes, where OEMs become the operators, and now they have this privileged access to this cornered resource, and they get to keep the added profits. Or will it be, everybody has access to these aircraft, so now we're back to the usual, low profitability airline models. How do you think that this will change the structure of the network and the overall profit distribution along the value chain?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, that's a super interesting question, guys. and, the, I was smiling when you, and when you introduced it, because, one of the things that I tell my business school students is that if we look at the commercial aviation value chain, once you get to the people that actually operate the stuff, there's not much left over. It's all the other guys that are taking, their generous slices of the pie. but you throw out a really intriguing idea, that, I mean, you'd have to go back to, almost to the dawn of commercial aviation when there were in fact OEMs that were the operators. That model does not exist, has not existed, and it's an intriguing idea. I suspect at the end of the day, and again, who knows, I've never been very good at prediction, but at the end of the day, even though the concept might be there, the notion that the manufacturer would actually then become the operator, I don't know, it's a little tricky. Just because I think, the OEMs, they could conceivably go in and say, okay, we're gonna, we're going to operate, let's take, let's just muse for a moment, since this is a thought experiment, let's just muse for a moment and say that these guys Heart they're building airplanes in Sweden. And Sweden is a geographically large, but empty country central places, there are small cities of 10 or 20, 000 people throughout the country that want to get to Stockholm to go shopping or see a show or whatever, do business in the capital. So you could conceive that Heart would say, we're going to make the airplane and we're going to operate the airplane in Sweden, right? And so, they get an operating license from, the Swedish government and they start flying. It's conceivable they could make that work, but at the same time, they're going to want to sell that airplane globally. And I can't foresee that, a relatively small company is going to want to ramp up. There's nothing that would keep them from doing that, but would want to ramp up and become, if you will, a global operator, all over with, with operating licenses and, 20, 30, 40 countries, but it's not out of the question. I mean, but it's a interesting possibility. If we look at the history of commercial aviation, though, I think we see a situation where, the, what was that, the wonderful phrase that one of the, business savants of the early 80s, always talked about, maybe it was Jack Welch or somebody like that, always talked about stick to the knitting. In other words, let's focus on doing the things that we know how to do best. And so, the OEMs make the airplanes and the commercial airlines operate them and there's not much in between. But again, nothing to keep them from trying that out as a model.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What do you think, needs to happen either with technology or the market side that would enable and accelerate the point to point network topology as opposed to the hub and spoke?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, well, I think that I think you're already seeing some successful business models here in the United States, airline business models, where the point to point, is the nature of the route structure. and it's, it's basically David Neeleman with Breeze and, and the guys at Avelo both of those companies, which, I always like to point out to my students, my Either in a moment of incredible bravery or stupidity, both of those airlines took wing during the pandemic and they're growing like crazy, right? And, they have picked out opportunistic places like New Haven, Connecticut and Burbank, California, Hollywood, Burbank Airport for Avelo. Neeleman is getting as big as he can in, in Westchester County, but as that airport is constrained, but he's finding these places where, you've got a pool of, a pool of, middle class, upper middle class, well to do people that want to travel and that they don't want to drive to and get stuck in traffic, making their way to LAX or JFK or whatever. So, so you're seeing some of this going on. Now, the reality is that, as the hub and spoke behemoths, Delta, United and American, every time they get a new regional jet or, either it's one of their owned companies or a franchise, every time one of those new aircraft are delivered, the economics of a hub say, put it into the hub and add another spoke. But these point to point guys are out there in the thing about, and where Breeze and Avelo are different is Avelo is, strictly single aircraft type 737 800. but Neeleman has found the sweet spot with the astonishing economics of the A220. and that plane has just astonishingly low seat mile costs. My friend, Ben Baldanza, who is on the JetBlue board we were having coffee a couple of years ago and we were talking about the A220 because JetBlue is now putting it into service, replacing their E190s. And their, the seat mile cost of the A220 is like 50 percent of what the E190 was. So with economics like that you're probably going to end with the capability of that airplane it's not just low seat mount cost. It's the fact that airplane has the range capability to go coast to coast. Neeleman is flying Breeze airplanes from Westchester to San Francisco and and Los Angeles. And so you can conceive of people looking at, at flows, traffic flows in the United States and finding, and this is what, I mean, Neeleman is doing this right now with the A220, finding, what's the next opportunity? And I think you could probably foresee some other people wanting to jump into that business with that particular airplane, because it is so capable and so economic and, we're, we're, we could conceivably see some additional sort of conventional, if you will, jet, turbine powered jet aircraft like that. But, we're starting, as you guys know, we're starting to approach, the laws of thermodynamics in terms of how much more efficiency can we extract from a gas turbine engine but, it's conceivable that somebody might get in and, build an airplane that's maybe even smaller than an A220, maybe it's a hybrid airplane, the, people are, people are clever and they're finding new things to do.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, I'd like to get your thoughts on the viability of the on demand airline model. There have been many attempts in the past, none really successful, yet entrepreneurs continue to try. Do you think the assets can be utilized enough to make these on-demand routes possible? Are new, cheaper aircraft the solution, or is it a structural problem that's tough to fix?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think it's a, I think it's tough to fix. I think you could see a way to have a limited success in, a small array of markets. And the problem with that is that, you then need to find demand that only needs to go in those limited numbers of markets, so people traveling up and down between Los Angeles and the Bay Area, I don't even know if that on demand outfit is still flying out on the way out in those markets in California. I mean, it could exist. It's limited. And you get other kinds of, you get other kinds of on demand models. I mean, if we're talking about, for example, Wheels Up, that Delta has just sunk a bunch more money into, you just wonder about whether they can, whether they can actually make that work vis a vis, the other kinds of, models that, that exist in, if you will, business aviation, the NetJets and the rest of those kinds of things. I mean, Wheels Up, if you look at their, if you look at their concept, if you look at their website, you look at thinking, well, there's got to be a market for that. And yet, they've struggled. I think to be honest with you guys, just not to, I know a little bit about them because I was working for a couple of years with a marketing professor at Wharton that I know very well. And we had, he was wanting to write a, Harvard case study about Wheels Up. And so we had a bunch of conversations with their chief marketing officer. It was pretty clear that even though they might have had a pretty good concept, they didn't really have an idea of how to go in and tap the market. So I, I think that, I think what ends up happening, and I think maybe to your question, Luka, about sort of structural issues. I mean, I, I'm a, most of my career in the airline business has been on the marketing and planning side. And I just, I think to myself, there's just, there's something about these on demand services that it just somehow, it's not a question of awareness because the people who are very affluent, that can afford to, travel this way, know about these things, but they've never been able to really get traction. So, I don't know, but having said that, if you put that, if you put the on demand concept together with, the array of new technology that's coming at us at a fairly rapid clip, you may possibly see in the future, some of these companies beginning to get traction, depending on how they do it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So given that you're talking about regional immobility, you're talking about on demand, how do you see the next 10 years playing out? What's a high probability occurrence as it relates to the commercial airlines, the introduction of electric hybrid, potentially eVTOL, STOL. And, what do you think is likely to occur\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, yeah, step one is that all of this stuff that's being developed, has to be built, and it has to be certified. And you guys know that, certification is not an easy task, these guys will get there. And so once the stuff is built and certified, I, I think you're going to find buyers. I mean, there are, as the big players have made token investments in a lot of this new technology, and so, they're, people are ready for this stuff. If we take it down to the scale of the regional network, I think it's, it's, it's my sense is that it's sort of field of dreams if you build it, they will come if somebody is out there and I'll just come back to Heart for a minute because I'm much taken with this idea of a hybrid. if they start delivering this airplane and it's, it's fulfilling the economics that, that they're doing. I think you're going to see some interesting stuff, but, I don't know, guys, I, maybe it's the function of fact that I'm 72 years old, but, 10 years, it strikes me that things in commercial aviation tend to move fairly slowly. So, I could foresee that by 2034 we're not going to see revolutionary changes, and especially, if we start to look at, you know, UAM and stuff like that, where there's just so many institutional barriers, so many political barriers, the, as you guys know, the pilot union is already spending a lot of money in Washington saying, we're never going to, you guys can never allow a commercial aircraft, no matter how big or small, to be operated without people piloting it, right? So there's just, you just, I tend to be, and maybe it's a function of the fact that I live 10 miles from the capital of the Republic and all the regulatory and political apparatus, but I'm a little bit skeptical about some of that stuff. So, I don't know. I think we're gonna, I think if I crystal ball 2034, I'm going to see some interesting changes on the margin, but I'm not seeing anything really revolutionary.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, decarbonization aside, what are some of the most important challenges that the airline industry is facing and grappling with today that, we'll need to find a solution to in the coming years?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I think that, for older companies, whether we're talking about the three legacies in the United States, and certainly all of the older companies in Europe, the labor cost issue, has been, for 50 years or longer and continues to be, a big deal. Right. And, you've got powerful trade unions, that, that have a lock, and institutionalized and guaranteed through law lock on contracts with legacy carriers here and in Europe and, they all want more money. And so you've got, that, that is, to me, again, as a long time observer for older companies, that's absolutely where it is, it's the cost pressures continue to be there. What else has gone on? I mean, we've, we simply have to, and I don't want to minimize this because it's huge. We simply have to find a way in the United States to split off, as they have done in most other industrial countries, the air traffic control function. the whole ATC system is held together with duct tape and bailing wire. And it's just, it's just got to be modernized and it will never be modernized under the current regime of being operated by the FAA. Now, you got Yeah,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:16:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp>separate podcast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:16:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>it is a problem. Yeah, absolutely. And I'd be happy to come back and yak with you about that. But that's a, that's a huge one as well. and then, what else is going on? I mean, you've got infrastructure challenges in, all of the big airports, there's not enough runway capacity, there's not enough terminal capacity, and so, the, Pete Buttigieg's solution to that is, well, let's, let's constrain the legacy carriers from continuing to grow at O'Hare or Kennedy or whatever, rather than the obvious solution is let's build more aviation infrastructure. But of course, politically, they can't do that because, there's, all these people whining about carbon emissions and all the rest of that. So, it's just, to sort of conclude, it continues to be a fascinating industry because there is just so many moving parts, not the least of which is the continued intrusiveness of national governments and the operation of the industry.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You've been given a hundred million dollars and you have to invest it in the industry. The return has to come within 10 years. What's going to get the bulk of the investment? What's not going to get any investment?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Wow. I, I get it. I think it depends, I think that's a really hard question to, to answer because it depends on who's holding the wallet with the hundred million dollars in it, right? I mean, if it's a, if it's a legacy carrier, they're gonna buy, they're gonna buy increasingly fuel efficient and capable new aircraft at the, at the larger size of the spectrum. So, the A350 or whatever, they're gonna buy A321s in the middle size. They're probably gonna start to build out more of these A220 smaller aircraft. if you're a, if you're a startup, and you're holding the 100 million wallet, you're gonna, you're gonna be buying, A220s, and you're going to be buying, these, these new, these newer propulsion technologies, hybrids or pure battery to the extent that they're able to be demonstrated to be effective and safe and stuff. And so, I wish I could be more, I wish I could be more articulate there, but as you guys know, I'm not a finance guy.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, but you're a lot. Listen, there are a lot of people listening, Rob, who may not know you, who are thinking, this guy's unbelievable. And they're, they think this podcast is a great discussion. Talk, tell a little bit about what you're doing today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I still do, a little bit of consulting in the sector. And I think that the companies that come to me, are people that want a holistic understanding of how the airline business works somebody with some gravitas and gray hair, and I have a gray hair, not very much of it. But I, I'm, I'm a person that when I approach a, a challenge when I'm given a business problem by a big company like Delta or a smaller manufacturer or a startup software company, I try to look at the problem holistically and I try to bring together, marshal together all of the experience that I have, in understanding how the airline business works. So, if somebody comes to me with this, what they believe to be an absolutely sterling idea about to, bewilderingly new technology. I have to give them a cautionary tale about certification and how long it takes to get stuff done by the government. So, so that's the sort of put over on that side. The other thing that I really do apart from, what takes up a lot of my time and that's being a invited guest lecturer in business school classrooms because I derive an enormous amount of joy from that. But the other thing that I do on the consulting side is, people hire me to explain how the business works to newcomers. And so just as an example of that, one of the big legacies, brought me in a year ago because they had just brought some new VPs on board that had come from outside of, the airline business and they needed to get up to speed very quickly. And that's what I do. I can explain how, airlines work. And so I sort of can deliver an Airlines 101 to an airline company, to a supplier, to an airport. I'm doing, that's, yeah, so that's kind of what I do.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>do it, you would do it very effectively, just based on our talk, Rob.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>thank you. so much.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You've been doing this for a while, as you've reminded us. Who are some people that have knocked you over in the last 50 years who you think are the top couple in the industry? And then who are some people today that you pay a lot of attention to?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I think, look, I don't know either. I don't know the Avelo guys at all. I, the guy that's the CEO is the former chief financial officer of United. I don't, but he, those people are obviously very brave people. They're knocking me over right now frankly, the whole decision to build out New Haven Airport is just, to me, is just a total stroke of genius. Neeleman with Breeze. I mean, here's a guy that started off in Utah with a little company called Morris Air, sold it to Southwest, started JetBlue, built Jet blew up, left JetBlue, started Azul in Brazil. I mean, this guy's a, he's a, he's a complete, clever guy. And, and there's a lot of other people that are like that, that, that are there that, some of the, the older guys that have been around for a long time, all the, the senior guys at Indigo, have an amazing track record. if I, to be honest, and maybe this is a good place to end, without getting myself in trouble with them place where I used to work at American. I look at Ed Bastian at Delta, is, and his leadership team, are absolutely building, a remarkable company. And, the, yeah, they had a, they had a huge, set back with the whole, the whole cybersecurity blow up with CrowdStrike a month ago. But that's a, and that was painful and it was a ding on their brand, but by and large, their trajectory has been forward and they are producing, probably the world's most consistent airline product. So those are guys that, that I look at. And again, those are all people on the operating side, because that's kind of where I spend most of my time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What have we not asked that you would like to answer?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think you've covered, we've covered a lot. and I've really, I've really enjoyed it. and it's been, it's been a great conversation.

Where would you advise them to go and innovate in the aviation value chain?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I would advise them to go and innovate in places that are realistic. I mean, you guys know that, billions and billions, have been and continue to be invested in, in these new technologies and not all these guys are succeeding. And so we're starting to see shaking out in, in eVTOL and a lot of this other stuff that's there. So if you've got entrepreneurs that are looking to invest, my, my guidance is just be very careful about this and don't believe, the pitch deck, and when you talk to the people and listen to the pitch deck, ask some really hard questions based on the fact that, we're already seeing, a lot of the companies that have attracted billions in venture capital, going belly up. So I, I'm a, I'm a believer in prudence. And I think prudence is a good thing when you've got money to invest.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Maybe that's the headline.

And this is where I come to Israel. I invite companies, first of all, to come see what's going on here. We have been very open and we invite everyone to come and witness with their own eyes, not Zoom, not video calls. Coming, meeting the companies, being in our control center, and then come fly because you're gonna hit that problems at one point or another. So start that early. Sure, you're taking a bit more risk that your drone might have a malfunction. But if you do it over an uninhabited area, then come on, start flying. Let's put up a USSP first in a remote area.

This discussion has layers of value to include what makes Israeli aerospace unique, which includes that it's one of the more threatened airspaces in the world. We also discuss the Israel National Drone Initiative. A very impressive program, how it started, who started it, which may surprise you the program itself and the results to date. We discussed costs and profitability of drone operations, and how costs may be different in Israel versus other parts of the world. Listen to Libby's 1, 10, 100 and how it relates to profitability. It's amazing to hear about the use of drones and the management of the airspace in light up the current war in Israel. And how Israel managed the use of drones in the first minutes and hours of the war. Simply amazing. We spent a fair amount of time discussing the different impressive evaluations that have taken place. And what parts of advanced air mobility may be at scale today as a result. And what elements of advanced air mobility Libby sees scaling in the coming years. And what do you think he's most impressed with with advanced air mobility today? The answer may surprise you. I'll give you a clue. Listen to one of our more recent podcasts for the answer. So many thanks to Libby for his entertaining and important conversation. And to our listeners we hope you enjoy our talk with Libby Bahat as you profitably innovate and The Vertical Space. Libby has been working in the Israeli CAA for the past 15 years as the Head of Aerial Infrastructure Department. Libby is a qualified ATC, an instrument flight procedure designer, a Lawyer, and he holds an American private pilot license. Within the Israeli CAA from 2020 Libby is also in charge of the UTM/ U-Space implementation within Israel. Libby, welcome to the Vertical Space Podcast. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Thank you. Thank you so much. It's an honor being here.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What do very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I wouldn't know where to start. as we're following the European regulation. the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority, was in a good position to have a choice, to which regulation do we want to follow? Do we want to make one completely from scratch on our own? We're not a part of EASA. We're not a part of Europe, of the EU. Obviously, we're not under the jurisdiction of the FAA. So, we were in a unique position. And we looked at a couple of sets of regulations. Obviously, the European set and the American set, when again, we're looking at the ATM part of, of UAS, of, UTM, Unmanned Traffic Management. Eventually we chose, the European set, the EASA set of rule regulation 664 and it's, all, its, cousins, 665, 666 and so on. And as you recall, the basic, architecture is referring to a couple of U-Space service providers. So, a USPACE, let's say, over a city or over an urban airspace, and then the unit that will manage the traffic will be the USSP, UAS Service Provider, and a USPACE Service Provider, and it is supposed to give four basic services, ATM, conformance monitoring, geo awareness. Flight Authorization Services. So, even with that basic architecture, we had many debates.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm going to interrupt real briefly, if I may. Thank you for that introduction. But what's controversial behind what you just said? What does somebody not agree with you on based on how you've started this process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the basic infrastructure of four major services, just as a first example, we had questions, whether traffic management, the fourth service, you might say the fourth, obligatory service, mandatory service. We were not sure, we're still not sure, I'm not sure that's why I'm having a lot of debates about it in Israel, is better than having conformance monitoring, which is considered not a mandatory service. So we have questions about which are the correct, the better, you might say, four basic services. That's one thing I'm in discussions, let's say, a disagreement is a strong word. The second thing is having multiple USSPs in one UAS airspace. Again, there are many people, I'm one of them, that thinks this is so far ahead, and this is not the way that the average city will develop. So I'm not really sure that everyone is focused on, in these projects, in the our initiative and in many other projects, that there should be multiple, uSpace service provider in every uSpace. I'm not sure this is the architecture that we'll see at least in the the next couple of years, maybe 10 years from now, for sure, five years from now. So, so that's the second thing. I'm, you could say in disagreement. A third example we can talk about is, who will enjoy UTM? Will it be the average citizen? Will I get, like everyone expects, their coffee and sushi and hamburger and pizza? I don't think so. And I started many conventions with a picture of the soup Nazi from Seinfeld that says, No soup for you. Because I don't think, based on the current business case and looking at the cost, that the average citizen will receive a delivery by a drone in the next couple of years. I think it'll take longer than that. I think the public as a whole, municipalities, Police, different government offices. They will be the main users, of course, emergency services and health. So the third thing I might say is that, I don't think the average citizen will enjoy it, in the next year or two. Fourth thing I thought about mentioning is the conspicuity devices. So, how do we integrate crewed traffic into, the U-Space? Which technology would we use as a conspicuity device? Europe is very focused on ADS- low, ADS B, many different kinds of, new technology. And again, I'm in a lot of conversations with our colleagues about using things that are more common. I know about the Israeli, GA industry. Aircrafts are very old and, I don't see people installing new technology new devices in there. So I think people will use what's already in there. For example, Mode S, and then enhancing the capabilities of Mode S. or, and again, these are things that, that came up. Cellular devices. So, using our cellular phone as a tracking, as a conspicuity device. So, this is just a short of four topics that I'm, I have difficult with,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's terrific. I have to first say, usually pulling this answer out of people is not easy, but you gave us four things that people disagree with you on. Let me ask you on one of them. We had a terrific podcast last week, with, Bobby Healy from MANNA. I came away,a real believer of the initial value of the drone delivery being the high volume, now with MANNA, profitable coffee delivery is kind of a foundational start, to home delivery. You may not disagree with that. What you may be saying, I just want you to give a little more detail here. A little more light. Are you saying that the emergency services, the police services and all are taking the first priority for a reason, having nothing to do with economics or capability or delivery or profitability? You're just saying that for whatever reason, with your experiences, you feel the emergency services and the police will take priority.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I have to make, two different views on what we're talking about when we're talking UTM and USPACE. To have a segregated area and deliver, a cheap item from point A to point B, that's not what I'm interested in. I'm interested in managing large scale operations, multiple companies over urban areas, with a nice and good competition, and how do we manage the traffic, how do we maintain the skies safe. I don't call having a segregated area around a mall or around Starbucks and serving a couple of villages around it. I know that's profitable and that's being done and the costs are much lower. But when everybody's fantasizing about the pictures from the Fifth Element of taxis flying one over the other in Manhattan, And, through large scale operation over big cities and UTM U-Space, that's what, where I'm saying, this is not coming very short. And, the costs are high, are very high, be behind every flight. We'll talk about it soon. We made around 25,000 flights during this. Israeli National Drone Initiative. We'll talk about it. The costs are very high behind every flight, there is an ARA, an Airspace Risk Assessment. There is talking to multiple, government authorities. It takes a lot of time, a lot of people, there are people that are maintaining and, taking care of the computers in the USSP systems constantly because there are still bugs. So behind every flight, there are a lot of people and it's simply very expensive.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, it will be interesting if you could share some of the numbers on these cost drivers, because again, referencing Bobby's, recent episode, he was very open book about the costs being, currently,$4.27 per delivery, trending down towards,$3 by the end of the year. And they're not flying in segregated airspace. They're flying in controlled airspace. And you have multiple, delivery operators who are now flying in the same airspace under the Mode C veil in Dallas Fort Worth, for example, with MANNA and WING just recently showing how they are, coordinating their own internal UTM systems, or actually they're using an external partner. But that reality that you describe is really happening already. And with MANNA doing it profitably, don't you see that this is an early use case. Isn't that enough evidence?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">First of all, I'm a regulator, I'm CAA. I don't have deep knowledge, of the exact budgets that every stage is taking. Yes, the Dallas and the WING and MANNA cooperation, first of all, is something new. We all remember that we've been talking about UTM U Space at least for four years now. And only now, in the last couple of months, we see something, profitable. To my knowledge, they are the only one in the world that actually reached some sort of, of commercial profitability. I don't know of anywhere else it happened. I was at the Air Force for many years. And there are many ways you can count, one hour of flight of an F 15. Is it just the fuel and oil you replace? Is it the time the pilot was, instructed and qualified? Is it the maintenance that's after, I don't know, a hundred flights? So, don't know if they counted in the cost that it took to do the airspace risk assessment and the cost that people invested, the time that people invested in talking to, Dallas, to Dallas Airport, to, insurers to municipality, to the public, so I'm looking at everything to have one of our demonstrations. We still probably do have one demo, let's say every two months. So we're taking over a city, bringing there, let's say, 10 companies, now they're a bit less, but 10 operators to operate in the same city. And before such a week, we have 10 people, at least, just from the government, from the initiative management, working on it, I think, two full weeks. And, so I don't know if you measured just the electricity it costs to, charge the battery. and I'd love to hear, how it was done.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, you should check out the episode because, not to belabor the point, but, they do have a fully loaded figure that includes, variable cost and depreciation of the airplane, et cetera. But, what are those numbers like for the companies that you are working with in Israel? How much is their cost per flight?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I don't have exact numbers, Sometimes it's a simulated delivery. So the drone is flying from point A to B, but without the actual ice cream, hamburger, sushi, but$50 a flight. this, cause it's doing the actual flight and, we take over, an airspace over a city and we have, let's say, six, five locations spreaded in the city and drones are flying from point A to point B. They're being given, a destination that we're picking in advance. Which is, I don't know, two, three, five kilometers away from their departure point, going to that location and coming back. So this is what we've been doing. We have other missions that are not only deliveries, so we have cooperation with municipality, with the park So we did cooperation with the train, with the post office, with during COVID 19 pandemic. with the health administration. So, we had many profiles.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We're going to talk in a minute about your introduction to the Israeli, National Drone Initiative, but before we do, I'm sure there are people would like to know what's unique about the Israeli airspace? And then we're going to ask you about the INDI and, what it is, why it is, and the results you've seen so far.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">so, Israel is pretty small. Israel, if you Google the distances, so we're 470 kilometers long and 135 kilometers wide at the widest point. So, it's a very small country. I think, again, the square kilometers is around the 22, 000 square kilometers. However, we do have one of the largest air forces, at least in Europe, so either, even though Germany or France or the UK are 10 times larger than Israel, we have pretty much the same air force. You can, so you can imagine 600 aircraft squeezing in one aerospace. So it's small to begin with, we have a very large air force. It's very active. They're training a lot. Every pilot, in the Air Force does at least one flight a day, sometimes two. So the airspace is constantly, occupied. So these are first two things. Of course, we do have a very active, general aviation community and helicopters and light sport aviation, gliders, balloons, UAVs. We'll talk about that, in more in a second. So it's a very congested airspace. other thing is even before the war, it was a pretty threatened airspace. Everyone is very much on alert constantly for hostile drones. You can, see now that we're dealing with tens of drones a day, right now during the war. But even before that, we saw at least one attempt per month, even at what you call so called peace time. So everyone, is really on high alert from hostile drones. Theoretically, I know every country says they are on very high alert from hostile drones, but I think again, the volume here is obviously, much higher, I think we have many authorities with actual capabilities to deal with a hostile drone. And you have to make sure there will not be misidentification between a hostile drone and a friendly drone. So again, that's a bit different, because I think in many other countries, not every policeman, but not every senior cop has the ability to actually take down a drone. And in Israel, it's much more common. So, so the actual ability to deal with the drones is different. The last thing that most of Israeli airspace of that small airspace is not civilian, is not controlled by civilian unit. Most of the airspace is controlled by a military unit. The airspace are shared. So air aircraft, civilian aircraft can use military airspace, but the units that are controlling, are Air Force units. And, I'm a controller at Reserve Service at one of those units. Uh, and this is something unique, but we learned to use this sometimes as an advantage. So to make a lemonade out, out of this lemon, there are things that, civilian ATC, are pretty reluctant to do. and that's different with military ATC. So we take the advantage of each situation. So, so that's what's unique about the Israeli air space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So tell us a little bit about the, INDI background, use cases, participants, results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, around four years ago at the beginning of 2020, we were approached by, to our surprise, our highway authority. So, Ayalon, Highway Company, it's the equivalent of the highway authority and by, the innovation, authority they approached us, and we very soon, we set up a meeting with our director general. And basically, what they said, listen, us, the highway authority, have a mission to make the roads as clear as possible, to make the traffic flow. And we want to look at the possibility of removing small trucks and, scooters and making the roads a bit clearer and safer. Our innovation authority said we have the budgets, it's innovation, it's high tech. We have a budget. We want to start with a big initiative. We want to experiment, we want to try, we want to get our feet wet. Have companies fly over urban areas, let's say Tel Aviv and we will learn from this experience. You, the regulator will learn, which are the laws that, that you should do, which regulations you should change. Everyone would benefit. And to everyone's surprise, you can say, our Director General gave the thumbs up, and says, I'm good with that, Ayalon Highway Authority. You may take the lead. You have my green light. You have my people. That's me and my colleagues, Ami and Liron. Please help them with whatever they need. So this is how it started. And the basic structure says that us, the three authorities set up a tender. And we say in a one month, there will be a USpace and a UAS airspace over Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, just name a city in Israel, we've done it in that city. So there's going to be an airspace that we're going to experiment with deliveries. So, let's say for the first demonstrations for the first two years, about 10 operators, 10 drone companies, applied. Every company was checked and double checked by the innovation authority to see it's a valid, good company. And, you should fly every day, 50 missions, 50 flights will give you on every morning where you have to fly to, and everyone has to be connected, obviously, with the control center. So one of the, the bullets of that tender was also applying for, uh, USSPs, companies that will run the aerospace. And, we have two companies in Israel that joined right from the start, Airwayz and High Lander there. And they remained until now. We didn't have a third company joining so far. And this is how the structure was built and after a month, and that continued for 25 times, a headquarter or a control center is being built in that city. Airways and Highlander are two USSP companies sit together, connect their computers, set up the DSS, we'll talk about it. The companies equipped their drones with remote ID and we start flying. This is the basic structure. Besides those dedicated demos, I think the European term I like using is VLD, Very Large Scale Demonstration. So other than those something VLDs, we also used some opportunities we had outside of these organized demos. So when COVID 19 meant a complete lockdown of movement, actually, in Israel, curfews and so on, though we offered our services to different hospitals and the Ministry of Health to deliver, covid, samples, and to deliver, something to a building that's isolated. But we can land our drone on top of the, on the roof of that building in that hospital, drop the supplies that the nurse required, and that would save a nurse to dress up, dress down. It takes about 15 minutes. So that's one, way we did during the COVID-19, when there was a security situation in Beersheba. And we needed to scan the roads, help assisting the police to track down a suspect. We used to have a crisis in construction site with people falling down because they didn't, harness themselves correctly or they're doing their duties with no helmet. So we had a ad hoc cooperation, to see the, we can, control the safety in those sites. So, I can name a couple of other, corporations, but, the basic structure is the VLD and then jumping on different, opportunities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So Libby, I'm curious to understand a little bit more one of the first things that you mentioned, where your views, diverge from the rest of the industry, flight management versus conformance monitoring. Do you mind exploring that, thesis a little bit in more detail, including, arguments in favor of each.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, the four services that are mandatory according to, the European regulation, are four, they are network id, geo awareness, flight authorization. And the last one is traffic information. And this is, something that we dealt with, during the beginning of the war. I'm taking you to October 8th, okay? Or let's say October, 7th, noon, when everyone knows Israel is under attack. And we know that the war started with drones being sent from Gaza towards Israel, and there was a very big fear that, hostile drones are still, within Israeli airspace. Very soon, we pushed the 9/11 button. Everyone on the ground now, after a couple of, minutes, all the villages and all the, security managers of cities, of remote villages, of settlements, called us and say, listen, we have to fly our drones because this is the way we take care of the perimeter. We patrol the fence. So, you have to withdraw this restriction. So we have, and again, it's not only a fear from drones, it's a fear from terrorists that penetrated Israel. Eventually, what happened, and I'm cutting a long story short, we can get to that later if you wish, is that we declared the entire Israeli FIR as a demo or a semi U-space. That every settlement was allowed to fly in its own territory, only if they're connected to the USSP. Very fast, we, we built the control center. Have Airwayz and Highlander, our two USSPs, sit together, and we gave the possibility for each settlement to connect to either one of them, just as, theoretically you would, the European regulations sees that could happen eventually in a city. And it became clear to us that we are giving, actually four services, but not the ones that the regulation is referring to. So we're giving a network ID, obviously, no one was allowed to take off without, a network ID. The companies were giving these, operators geo awareness service. Before they would fly, they would file a flight authorization request. But, there was no need to, for traffic information service. There was a need, however, because everyone was flying within his own settlement. And many of these flights was anyway VLOS, because these were the guards having their drones within line of sight, doing their line in their territory. It doesn't have to be the full settlement, but their part that they were responsible in that fence. But it was very important to have a conformance monitoring because we wanted to make sure that if these were, on the border of being amateurs, these were not professionals, again, guards and volunteers for every settlement, for every village, including from my kibbutz where I live. Volunteer told the management here, listen, we have a drone we have good camera capability. I can guard this part of the fence from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM So many people volunteered and we wanted, it was very important for us to give them some sort of an alarm if they're doing something you're not supposed to do.. If they're getting away from the area that they are, they're allowed to operate. So conformance monitoring was very important. Traffic information was not so important. Now, when I try again to learn from this experience, and this is, getting close to what I was talking to in the first part of where people disagree with me, I think the average development of a shopping mall with one company serving the villages around him will happen much faster than 10 operators over Tel Aviv, a couple of, USSPs will give their traffic services. I don't think we'll reach that amount of traffic that will, it will make it profitable for everyone. I think we'll start in many places with one company giving services to the areas around it. And the services that are important are the ones I mentioned. The traffic information service is for a later stage. Even that, again, I'm in a couple of teams in Eurocontrol, in EASA. Including the ones, Andrew is so active at, and the way that traffic information service will be giving is questionable. Theoretically, the operator should get an information about a drone that is approaching him that is, not monitored or, a man crewed vehicle or, under the the, dynamic crewed, traffic. He's supposed to, take care of that. He's supposed to land, move his drone. There are many questions on how it'll be actually implemented and, I think it's a very good. philosophical or not discussion, but this is some part I'm, first of all, I'm imagining the development, the chronological development, as a certain direction. I might have it all wrong, but assuming this is the way evolution will go, I think the weight on each services will get clearer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's an interesting observation. And one thing that comes to mind is, if you're suggesting that there will be one operator per region serving a certain amount of airspace and the people underneath them, it becomes very difficult to then, arbitrate who will be that one provider in that area, right? Obviously as a government, you cannot say, no, we already have one operator in this area, so nobody else can come close in a way you're then promoting a monopoly in that particular area. So I don't think that's the way to go either. So at some point, the market forces will drive operators into a certain area. And now the problem is, okay, let's say that we have more than one, does that create the need for traffic information service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>32:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. Definitely. I wish, and I truly hope that I'm wrong and that I would get a request from four companies or even two to start deliveries in Tel Aviv. And then I would say, okay, guys, how do you, manage the separation? So I really hope I'm wrong, but until that situation comes, I think we will see more and more situation when we have, deliveries by one company because no one else wants, you're very right. I truly wish that I will get a request just as we start with multiple operators to operate in a certain airspace. However, since I know the costs right now, at least in Israel, are very expensive and the service will be very expensive, I'm not sure it will happen. I was starting to say that I'm looking at many problems in my life, in aviation, let's say, from history. And I'm looking about, how expensive services and new technology started. And I'm looking at the helicopter, taxi services in New York. And when I was a kid, I looked at the helicopter and my dad told me, oh, this is so expensive. When you're old, it'll be cheap. It'll be a 10 helicopter. It didn't happen. so I hope this will happen much faster, but for now on, since this services are expensive, I don't see a very large market and so many customers, so I hope I'm wrong, but that's why I think we won't start off right from the beginning with multiple operators because of these costs. When the first company arrives, starts delivery, as soon as the second company arrives, that'll be a good point to tell, okay, and, and we can set that off from the first contract with the first company. Okay, guys, you knew this is gonna come. I told you that when another operator comes, you will have to find a solution for safety, and you will have to have someone to manage the airspace. Guess what? As the Europeans like to say it, an acceptable means of compliance would be a USSP. By the way, do we need at that point two USSPs? Maybe we need just one company to manage the airspace. So I'm talking about scalability and costs. I have a good fault in that we've been working very hard in Israel on how to, and I'm going to get to that right with that question. What are the bottlenecks? So we've been working extremely hard in Israel on making this work. So making two USSPs cooperate perfectly, having no bugs, having restricted areas going back and forth. Having the flight authorizations, whatever is needed, and, it is very hard. And now, or let's say, as I, you could say, grew up a little bit and learned the costs, I'm thinking we might have made a mistake and we might have focused not on the most important and urgent thing. We've been focusing very hard on making a couple of USSPs work together perfectly in a U-Space. And what I'm telling you now, how sometimes I view things, it doesn't correlate with that knowledge now. But I was the first one to promote working on cooperation between a couple of USSPs. And that brings me to a question. Having two USSPs, or three, or fifty, working together is extremely hard. It's extremely hard because of emotions that competitors have, and, you can, assume a perfect utopic world, but we're talking about people. And when two companies have to work together the atmosphere has to be good. And when it's bad, and he's not working according to criteria, no, that guy's not working according to criteria. And unlike other topics that I'm in charge of in the CAA, I'm not a coding expert, and I don't know all the algorithms on the ATSM by heart. And, so, so that is a major, bottleneck, having two companies cooperate, so that's one stage. And then there's the actual technical difficulties. There are hundreds of commands and hundreds of orders and code is switching from one place to another. And hundreds of questions arise. And to some of them, I would say even many of them, there is no one answer. And, we had to answer many questions. And, this was the second and third, bottlenecks. The actual technical difficulties of running such a complicated mission. And the third one is the criteria that is not yet existing. So these are three, bottlenecks, I would state that these are going to be a big headache for me when we start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so is it fair to say that most of the challenges are, a step beyond simply assembling the information of the traffic picture across the different operators, but the challenges are really in using that information, how to coordinate the flight operations and keep them deconflicted when you're dealing with competing operators. Is that what you're saying?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think so, and this is just looking internally. So having two companies cooperate. Having, two companies, both software, you could say, working, that's the, second issue. Answering questions that are not, or getting answers that are not in criteria, that'll be the third. and we haven't even started talking about, different issues that are coming from outside. So, police, so Air Force, and many other government authorities want to have a say and want to make you do something for their needs. So, just looking at the internal difficulties, these are the major problems I stated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The National Drone Initiative has been ongoing for a few years now. What are some of the biggest insights that came out of it? And I'm curious, how come after so many years, there is no regular commercial operations of drones.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">On a private or commercial area for one single company, we have a lot of drone activity. Drones have been flying in Israel for more than 50 years. I was working on the first AIP chapter that incorporated them into the Israeli airspace 15 years ago. The first AIP chapter, on routes corridors and training zones was published in Israeli AIP in 2010. So we have around 300 companies registered, 300 operators, and around I think 3,500 drones have a registration number, meaning they're doing commercial activity. It sounds, doesn't sound like a lot, but if you look at Israeli size, that we are only less than 10 million people. If you look at the scale, it's pretty okay. So a lot of companies are having very successful commercial activity in the drone industry. So we're looking at agriculture and we're looking at photography and different IR scans and security. You name it. I think Israel is pretty known for being rather advanced. And there are many, companies that are working very successfully. We think generally, we're looking at, uh, a formula that says 1, 10, 100. So one operator operating 10 drones doing 100 missions a day. We generally say, as a very generalized, formula, when we were at that point, then we can be profitable. If we have one guy operating one drone, again, we might have get, got the math wrong, but we don't think this is, profitable again for the average citizen. So that's why the main, areas that it is worthwhile is the areas that, that I mentioned that are for public. I don't like, you can say the police example, cause, cause that's a wholly, a totally different, ballgame. That's first responders, that's emergency, let's say getting a defibrillator, serum, and they have, again, looking at manned, crewed traffic, this has been like this for ages and there will be no difference in drones, if a police helicopter used to have priority, then the police drone will have priority, and the same goes for medical operations.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you see the same concept of separation minimums of the traffic for drones that we already have with helicopters and other aircraft operating in the airspace? Will they be kept apart by the same distance? Do you see it as being something different for drones and, what is the capacity of the airspace for these different drones to operate alongside each other based on that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we started off, with a very basic, number, you could say, before the initiative, the basic number for, BVLOS separations was a separation of, five miles from IFR flight 2000 feet. And from, in Israel we have what we call controlled VFR route, or in short term CVFR, controlled VFR, and from VFR routes we allowed five kilometers but still, 2000 feet. That's, with the very basic certification process and before, dedicated the risk assessment. So, this is how we started the initiative after, when we started with the first demos we knew each company went a very detailed certification process and testing of their specific drones. So after we did that process, then the basic separation, got down to 500 feet. And, it was still, five kilometers, but 500 feet, vertical separation from, VFR traffic and man, the crewed, VFR traffic. And this was, fair enough for the, these, demos by the way, between the drones themselves within a U-Space we experimented with 60 meters between one drone and another. The initial altitude for the, U-Space was, 400 feet. That was the initial, number and that's around 120 meters, so we thought, again, looking at the traffic volume, we actually need to have two drones passing at the same second one over the other. So we experiment a little bit with, two actual, levels. So one drone flying at 60 meters, the, the other at 120 meter, again, very soon we realize it's working. We have to work a lot and very hard and the cost of having one drone do 360 or hold for 15 seconds and letting the other one pass, it's just so much simpler, and the traffic volume doesn't really justify getting into all that very hard work. I do see a very, big difference from manned traffic and that eventually every drone, the USSP, that unit would know its specific characteristics. So if I know that the regulator authorized for Matrice 300 for a specific type of drone, that we know that it was proven to us the accuracy levels are 60 meters by 60 meters, and another drone is less accurate. The other drone is cheaper, and that's, we could prove, or someone could have proved to us, that drone's accuracy level is 100 by 100, then the USSP systems would be able to tailor a separation for each drone. And it's a very big issue if I was a controller and I would known 737 800s have this level of accuracy, Airbus 320 have that level of accuracy and so on and so forth. But when a computer is running the thing, then I have no big issue of having a tailor separation between each two sets of drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And if you get down to, 60 meters by 60 meters type of separation, even in work you're doing today, and that still strikes me as a high number, but even if you stay there versus what you might achieve in the coming years, to me that seems like that would minimize the impact on the other drones that are operating in the airspace is type of separation would leave a lot of capacity, in the airspace system for drones. Is that the right read, on this or do you see it a different way?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I see it, the same way exactly. I was at a webinar or, it was even, a, of a conference that I think the Spanish authorities, I believe, were investigating a much lower number. Just as you said, I don't think it's a realistic, number. the second issue I was coming to is the reference altitude. The how do we, make sure that the drone that took off from one place but lands on the other has the same reference altitude as a third drone that took off from a totally different place? And that's another thing that you could say is you, it's not only unique to Israel now, but GSS interferences. So GSS interferences are a big thing in Israel. I know not only in Israel, now entire Central Eastern Europe and many other areas. Unfortunately, conflicts are not only in Israel right now. When you take everything into account, I think 60 meters as just, as you said, is it, is an ambitious number to begin with, I'm not sure how quickly it will be absolutely necessary, and I if I have a better solution of separating traffic, if it means one drone will, slow down for 30 seconds, I prefer the easy and simple solution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As I understand the operations that you have trialed so far are mostly VLOS, correct?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, I would say, something between, a third or even a half were BVLOS.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What's involved in obtaining approvals to fly BVLOS?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm not in the, airworthiness department, so I'll have to have a assistant from my colleague, Ami, from, airworthiness and engineering. But again, it's not something, new, of course, beyond visual line of sight operations have been in Israel for many years. And it's not something new. I could say just one thing without getting into the technical specification of what it takes to take a BVLOS. First of all, it doesn't require detect and avoid. So, drones that were manufactured, Hermes 450, for example, they're manufactured in a factory next to, uh, which is in the north part of Israel. And then those, had to fly to test their engines to instruct a foreign, customer, their BVLOS. obviously, they're flying, in an unsegregated airspace with other traffic, but without detect and avoid. The second thing is that we required a very well trained operator that's very well, knowledgeable in IFR flights, in, different malfunctions, obviously communication problem, navigation problem, just almost as an IFR pilot. And I know we were approached many times being told, Hey guys, what's needed to fly a Hermes 450 from the north of Israel to the south part of Israel is different than what it takes to fly a Matrice 300 or an Autel, over the margins of Tel Aviv over a large central park. So, these are a couple of requirements.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, so IFR expertise is not really a factor if you want to fly a small UAS up and down the coast beyond visual line of sight. So, is the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority using a SORA like framework to try to assess air risk and ground risk and then based on that assigns a SAIL level and later approvals for operators. Would you describe that process as very much similar to a European process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, it does. Again, not in my department, it's Aerial Infrastructure Engineering. I get to the part of that assessment that involves the aerial infrastructure. Again, this has been going on, for more than 10 years in Israel, you might even say, 50 years in Israel, and I get, into the picture when we're looking at the aerial infrastructure. Do we get next to an ILS and next to a SID from Ben Gurion? From a VFR route, what we call the controlled VFR training zone, and so on and so forth. But generally, yes, we didn't invent anything new. We're following a European regulation. I think we have some combination with the FAA regulation. I know for sure with licensing, we're following part 107. And I think historically the Civil Aviation Authority was very well connected 15 years ago, much more to FAA regulations. And we have a couple of relics from that period, like licensing, but, we're following either European or FAA regulation very strictly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I see. And I'm curious about your comment about not requiring detect and avoid for some of these larger UAS BVLOS flights. Is that because the entire airspace is so very tightly controlled that, there's less emphasis on detect and avoid.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, that's because all the airspace is controlled by a military controllers that have, very good sometimes too, strict control on every vehicle, on every aircraft. That's why we don't rely on the eyes of, of the operator. We don't need the eyes of an operator on the vehicle itself. They do not share the airspace with VFR. So in VFR traffic, theoretically, there is no such thing as separation and as instructions of ATC, but we rely on visual flight rules. So I won't get a drone in those routes. I usually I rely on both pilots. Either one of them will have to see the other traffic. Even if one is delayed, the other one will catch it first.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So general aviation VFR flights can only happen in certain corridors in Israel?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">When it's a bit complicated, if it's unplanned and you just want to hop on your Cessna and take off, to train a little bit, then you can do it, yes, only on certain corridors and on certain training areas, normally close to the, the airports on weekdays. Weekends, it's a bit different. There's much more freedom for the civilian low aviation to go about, wherever they want. And even during weekdays, they always have the possibility to request a special, request. they ask these, they file these requests and hundreds a day, to do this or that activity. Sometimes it's authorized, sometimes it's not. Mainly because. the airspace is packed with the Air Force training or doing operational missions. So, it's kind of a special situation in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just out of curiosity, at what altitude does controlled airspace start?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's basically you could say from zero to 5, 000 feet, but looking at very basically, there are some sections it'll go to 10, 000 feet and some that'll go below 500 feet. And even, it's a topic for another podcast. Even the way the controllers are controlling VFR traffic is almost close to IFR. They are giving them very strict instructions and separation, and they are very worried if two Cessnas come in a converging junction. But 5, 000 feet is a fairly good number.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So considering all of these factors, airspace and otherwise, is Israel an attractive region for drone operators from other countries to come in and do business? How often does that happen?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, we started the initiative, and I think we got a little bit famous around the world just a couple of years ago, let's say three to two years ago. And a year ago, nine months ago, the war started, just as before the initiative, getting a operator to fly in a country and not his own there's a paperwork involved. If I were to come with an Israeli company and start doing business in the U. S., It's not so simple. I think that again, Israel is a very attractive, or let's say should be a very attractive place for foreign companies to come because we took all these lemons and made them into a lemonade. So the fact that most areas are not controlled by civilian ATC means that we have, to do the coordinations with the Air Force and they apply very good logic, they are not obliged to look at some of the separation laws that the conventional, the historical, separation laws that came from a certain history in a certain context that is not relevant today. So we can execute to some extent logics that we cannot, demonstrate with civilian ATC units, unions, you name it. Now, the second thing is that again, I think we, the Civil Aviation Authority, have demonstrated that we are pretty flexible and that we are very helpful, that we are very approachable. You don't have to take my word for it. You can ask people from the industry, but me, Ami from Airworthiness, Liron that works with me, the SWAT team that was established to take care of UTM U-space. We are really doing our best, and sometimes an operator, it's very important for them. They might give up some profits, they might look at different problems they have getting a responsive and active regulator is a very big bonus. Now, the last thing is that I think, like the famous song, if you made it in Manhattan, you can make it anywhere. Well, if you've flown in Israel, no one can tell you that, you can't cooperate with authorities. No one will tell you that you cannot fly in places that have a hostile drone threat. And no one can tell you, ah, you, you probably can't fly in congested airspace.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I like your analogy. If you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere, right? But you're not at scale, though. So even though people are operating in Israel, and you can say, well, if you could do it here, you could do it anywhere. But nothing's really at scale. Or am I missing something?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think, having, around 25, 000 flights, let's say half or third of them in BVLOS in four years, in 25 very large scale demonstrations over people, over, the most major cities in Israel, over Jerusalem, the most sensitive place on Earth. With the size of the Israeli airspace, I'd say we're at scale. I didn't hear of any other country that ran a demo or a project with 25, 000 flights. It's true that the market. in Israel has its limitations. We're 10 million people. Let's say the more, more attractive parts of Israel with the major, customers, that is the big cities, the major urban, areas. Let's say our half of it, so we're looking at 5, 4, 3 million people. And that's true. The market is not very large. I think we have our advantages. someone can grab the opportunity and if our advantages are exactly fit that this or that company that can make good use of it I think they will be very unique So again, I think our attractiveness is true. It's not size and the market, but it's the other considerations of, and other special factors in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, on a few different, dimensions, you've mentioned the impact of military drone operations in the airspace and how that shapes the scale up of commercial operations. Looking at what you've seen in the Israeli airspace relative to this, and then also what we're seeing from the growing use of drone operations in wars like Ukraine. And if we project ahead to the future, what do you see as the implications of all of that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We had, this question being slapped on our face on October 7th, and we had to answer it right away. So we had about 24 hours to understand that we are in a highly threatened, new state of Israel, a new situation, yet we also knew in order to save lives, we have to allow friendly drones to fly. So that question was thrown in our face pretty aggressively on October, 7th. And right away. By the way, it went, we made an emergency regulation. We went to the parliament. Our two, units, our two USSPs were licensed according to Israeli law. So it wasn't, something that, that went on, without thinking it went through the entire, legal process in Israel. And basically what we did right away is mandate a remote ID to every small drone that's taking off. We mandated, that either company, that the entire Israeli airspace would be covered by companies that knew that's their responsibility and that they would pick up any RID Signal that that shoots up in that airspace. By the way, we contacted very fast DJI to open up their, RID broadcast services and they did it pretty fast. They understood the situation. So basically every drone that people are buying right now is transmitting, broadcast, RID right now. So, so these are a couple of, the solutions we found right away. I can say, from my experience, also in my, as, as my, with my reserve hat on, even the way that the Israel has dealt with the drone issues, even within Israel is very different. You hear about a couple of drones a week entering the northern part of Israel But although there have been a hundreds and hundreds of attempts from Yemen and from Iraq to send drone to the south part of Israel, no one succeeded. I don't want to get too much military here but even within israel, there are parts that the solutions that were there work much better. And obviously there are places where the solutions are much harder. There's no one solution. And we will have to build on many small solutions and try to make an impact.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, you've gone through many successful years with the INDI.

What's going to be at scale and why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I, I'm in a bit of a disagreement with my colleagues, as you heard. I wish that I would have, in three years from now, At least two USSPs in all the cities of Israel. I hope the bigger ones, obviously more customers, more people will enjoy more to the public, all these USSPs will be coordinated with the different defense organizations in Israel. So the Air Force, the police, other security organizations will have that. Picture so every police officer could have two swipes on his iPad and see if the drone above his head in the middle of Tel Aviv is a friendly one or he should take it down. and that goes, to the unit, to the Air Force unit. I know we're focusing for very good reason on urban airspaces and how do we provide the services in urban airspaces, but I want cities to be connected. We've been having a lot of flights between U-Spaces, long distances. Vehicles with the eVTOL, you just have to have a wing and it's, and you can call it eVTOL, another multirotor. So, larger vehicles. We've had, the EHang vehicle, both the 216 the passenger version and the cargo version flying in Israel. So I would want to have, some sort of taxi service. It won't be cheap. that's what I think, But I'd want that to happen.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But that's unlikely to be at scale in a couple of years. Clearly what you're describing with the drones, for the police forces, for the security forces, that it's seamless, that probably will be at scale is what we're hearing. And I'm guessing there will be some kind of drone delivery services, whether it be for, coffee, hamburgers, or medical delivery. It sounds like that may be at scale based on the excellent lessons learned. My guess is a little bit from what I'm hearing, passenger carrying vehicles, probably not at high volume scale, right? In three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I absolutely agree. We have, stations outside the city, you can park your car and take a bus. So if I can for 10 kilometers, even less so, if, if I can have a, EHang for$100 a flight doing this, seven minute flight the next central station in that city, I'd be very happy. Just as you said, I think the operations that will be of scale are those that have some sort of public value. So, I think municipalities will be a good place. Heavily using drones. I think government offices, environmental, looking for, construction garbage that, that, truck drivers throwing their, the dump from their trucks at illegal places. So I think, a general public, usage will be, at scale. I know we've been in contact with many offices and municipalities, court authorities, of course, the health industry. So I think in three years from now for that, I can, I'm pretty positive, unlike what I said at the beginning, that there will be a very long time before I'll get my sushi with a drone. I think it's different with public use, and that I can bet.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I do want you to give two minutes to the USSP providers out there. Let's say governments who are going to be deploying the USSP's and service providers, commercial organizations that are part of this process. What advice would you give to people? It's not, you have a lot of practical experience with really complex airspaces. What advice would you give to countries or providers for USSPs?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The first advice is having a very good knowledge in aviation and in regulation. We had high tech companies, very smart people, but without previous knowledge in aviation, they're having a very hard time understanding the logic. Look, I have a perfect solution. Yes, it's not STM, mine is better. No, you don't get the picture of the way things work. So, so this is, one advice. The second, that's more for countries and organizations. Don't do anything alone. Get cooperation for, I would say, the ideal number is three to four organizations. More is too much, and doing everything on your own is too little. So I would say join hands with other government agencies, other government offices, and don't do everything that one organization leads the entire thing. it's a, I don't know, it's an obvious advice, but you have to get people that are really into it, that really love it. You have to find that guy in the right organization, in the air navigation service provider, in Regulator and have that SWAT team being set up. Be sure that these guys get the authorities, get the approvals, get backed up from their managers. that's true in, in, in many issues. You have to get the right people really enthusiastic about it. And again, having, personal, connection with everyone on board. So meeting a lot, understanding the other guy's problem, not making decisions on your own. For sure you don't understand the full picture of your partner. And you have to have ongoing, very good, relationship, personal, and only then you will get to a much more educated, decision and it will save you time, in the future for granted funding goes without saying again for every problem in the world. And get the regulator on board and making sure that he's giving some sort of flexibility and that he has the ability and the will to help you. If a regulator wants to help you, they have ways. Every regulator has its ways, so you just have to get him on board. These are the top advices for people just starting a national drone initiative.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">When you look around the world and you see drone operations, being conducted, where are you most impressed?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right now, Dallas. Obviously, Dallas is very impressive because that's commercial. We've seen a lot of activity around the world, But Dallas would be the first. I hear a lot, I think I hear most of the things that's going on in Europe, but from now on, I have to say, if you're looking at actual flights and actual activity, it's low scale I'm, again, I have the pride to say we've done a lot of activity in Israel, I didn't see anyone get near that. Ireland, a lot of good things are going on in Ireland, thing that's really impressive in Europe is the regulation, the way they do regulation. We're very good, you could say, at practical experience. We, we hear of an idea and we run away and fly it. We want to experiment, to play with it, with our feet wet. That's one approach. The Europeans, I think, have a different, more strict approach, looking at the problem from one hand to the other, back and forth. And for me, with another approach, it's impressive to see the way they work. Very organized, very structured. And I'm impressed from that part in Europe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But the at scale operations in Dallas is a standout for you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, definitely,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What would you like to leave with our listeners? You've done a lot of years of very effective initiative here. What would you like to leave with our listeners that you think is unique based on your experiences?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think that you should get your feet wet. I think that the main advice I have. Maybe that's because it's a kind of an Israeli approach. It has some disadvantages, but I think staying too much time at the offices and drilling too deep into a third class, and remote scenarios in your risk assessment, it sometimes gets, not very effective, and I would suggest to put a limit on that and go out to the field and get your feet wet, get your feet wet, in not in the most, favorable environments. And this is where I come to Israel. I invite companies, first of all, to come see what's going on here without, without coming with your drones yet. But I do invite countries to learn from others experience. We have been very open and we invite everyone to come and witness with their own eyes, not the Zoom, not video calls, coming, meeting the companies, being in our, a control center, and then come fly, and because you're gonna hit that problems at one point or another. So start that early. I think the risk assessment can support that. Sure, you're taking a bit more risk that your drone might have a malfunction. But if you do it over an uninhabited area, then come on, start flying. Let's put up a USSP first in a remote area. Combine a couple of companies. experiment. that's my main, message. And the second one is come do it in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:10:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, great.

The viability of it has been proven very clearly. That this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think there has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space podcast and our conversation with Bobby Healy, CEO and Founder of Manna Drone Delivery. Bobby was a standout guest when we had him on the podcast back in March of 22, and we're delighted he could join us for a return visit today. Returning guests, give us such a cool perspective. They provide an update on the original assumptions and actual outcomes of the last two years. And with Bobby drone delivery overall, and more specifically Manna Drone Delivery, he reminds us of the original assumptions, what has actually occurred and what's been pleasant and disappointing surprises and how he sees the future and perhaps differently than his original assumptions. For those of who know Bobby and listen to his original conversation, you know he's a compelling, articulate industry veteran and accomplished aviation business professional. He's both a person who understands the technology and its application, and combines this with decades of aviation knowledge. And highly successful aviation technology implementation. This isn't always the case with some of the innovators and leaders in advanced air mobility. And it's perhaps one of the reasons more our app to bet on Bobby's projects and his vision for the future. And as we do with all guests, we listened to their important messages and we politely challenge their core underlying assumptions. And we've done the same with Bobby. Listen to what Bobby says is the killer app for drone delivery. Do you agree? He provides details with market size and price, which is refreshing. He talks about the value of B2C versus B2B in drone delivery. This in itself would make for a good podcast discussion as a lot of companies are focusing on B2B delivery. One of Bobby's essential messages is that the economics have now been proven for this space. Listen to his discussion of business and operational profitability. As we all know, getting to profitability is a challenge for any business. And it has been particularly challenging for some in advanced air mobility. Listen to how we discusses how Manna wants to power big and small brands directly. As an example, he has a deal with Coca Cola, where he flies their products. He discusses how he simply wants to replace the road and that consumers will and should never go back to road based delivery. If you listen carefully, you'll hear why Bobby has been more successful than others. I was a bit surprised by technology is actually deploying in house versus what others would hope he would purchase from outside technology providers. And finally listen to where Bobby believes advanced air mobility investments should be made beyond drone delivery. His answers may or may not surprise you. So many, thanks to Bobby for rejoining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our talk with Bobby Healy as you innovate and generate profits in The Vertical Space. Bobby kicked off his career building video games for Nintendo. He then founded Eland technologies an airline technology company, which he sold 12 years later to SITA. He then built Car Trawler the world's largest mobility marketplace for airlines over 15 years and led two successful LBOs for the business. For the last four years he's been building Manna a\"Drone Delivery as a Service\" business, whose mission is to improve the world by making lightning fast, suburban deliveries, affordable green and safe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, welcome back to The Vertical Space. We first spoke in March of 2022 and so we thought it would be great to bring you back and talk about the drone delivery industry and what has changed there, as well as what has changed with Manna. A lot of things have changed. So time to debunk some myths.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And it's great to be here again, guys. I'm really looking forward to it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Perfect. As you know, we typically ask if there's something that few in the industry agree with you on, would you amend your original answer or something else that's on your mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">If you look at my LinkedIn, you'll see that argument or the main arguments play out. Most people assume, not people in our industry, but generally people think that the use case is critical products, medical, defibrillators, urgent, societally beneficial products, and they are great use cases for sure. But the economic reality is that coffee and takeaway food is the killer app for what we do. That's one thing that most people, they don't disagree, they're just uninformed. They haven't done the work or the research that we've done on where the market opportunity is. And then the second one kind of hand in hand with that is a lot of people believe again, incorrectly that the unit economics or the capital economics don't work right now that they will at some point in the future when some magical technology comes along to make them work. But that's where I find, I enjoy myself the most on LinkedIn answering some of the people that have, raised those questions because I mean, I have the data, we have the flights, we're operating with profitable economics now. And I do enjoy engaging with people on the many misconceptions that are in our industry. And thankfully, we've already debunked them, not in theory or research. We're actually flying the debunk, even today as we speak we're flying aircraft in Dublin that are running profitable unit economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I would add that even when we talk to industry insiders, there is a tendency to think that B2B delivery use cases will be the ones that scale first, or at least if you asked them a couple years ago. There was a general tendency to believe that urgent cargo, high value not necessarily high volume movement will be the one that gains traction initially, especially because of the, arguably easier safety case to build with predetermined points in the network, as opposed to ad hoc, don't really know where the next order will come up, low value, you know, how in the world can you make money, delivering coffee and meals, et cetera, et cetera. Yet, as we often discuss on the podcast, those use cases didn't really scale past POCs and pilots, globally, whereas the, B2C delivery, the kind that Manna is doing is really starting to show some interesting inflection.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I agree. In the end we're running an infrastructure and that infrastructure is an airline. It's a cargo airline. And just like any other airline, utilization is a key factor in the profitability of that airline. And every airline in the world talks about load factor or utilization in our world. And you don't get that with high priority, critical goods, the volume just isn't there. So there's no world where you can make, those critical medical type deliveries a very interesting business from a commercial standpoint. And the other thing is you don't learn anything by doing that. Other than building an aircraft, you don't really learn anything. The real learning in serving the space we serve is in being in the trenches doing five, six hundred, a thousand deliveries a day out of a small car park and getting a 30 second turnaround time and embedding that learning into the software, into the hardware and iterating through that. So unfortunately, and there's a number of great players in our space that are doing and have done a really good job, pioneering job, I would say in medical delivery, but it doesn't translate in any way whatsoever to suburban, backyard, high throughput delivery. it's just two totally different paradigms and two different things to optimize.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Some of the guests we've had on have sometimes mentioned coffee delivery in a trivial way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Disparaging way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. And so, so when, as you're saying, listen, it's a, is it a good start for you? Is it a good proving ground for you? But can you scale and meet your financial projections that you want to hit in the next three years, delivering coffee?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already, every single coffee delivery we do is profitable. So 100 percent of them now, like we used to be at the weekends because we'd have higher utilization and then, weekdays were less so, but now our volume has diluted the fixed cost per location so they are profitable. And the thing about coffee is there isn't a product as popular on the planet for adults on a daily basis that has the adoption rate and the frequency and the gross margin that works so well that where the benefits of flying in a straight line as we do underwrite the new mode of delivering these products. So in a world where there's no such thing really as coffee delivery and people are now, I mean, you know, Starbucks or Starbucks drive thru is an example of Starbucks mobile app, people are absolutely addicted to, I would say, high consumption patterns, high frequency purchasing coffee. So of course it's going to be the best product. But now you say, people do trivialize it. Yes, only because I think not from a business sense, they're not saying coffee isn't a great product, but they're really saying, I think, is using the airspace to deliver a coffee seems like a bad idea to me. That's really what they're saying without saying it. And that's the purpose of I think regulation and the standards like Part 108 or in our case, U-Space in Europe, standards that are scalable that do allow high throughput in that airspace below 500 feet. And when we look at the market size we estimate that today there's 5. 2 billion food deliveries a year from the top four aggregators annually growing at 15%. So think DoorDash Uber eats all the way down and that's with a constrained market where there's a labor shortage, there's labor costs, economics problems, and there's a quality issue. So, so therefore those 5. 2 billion orders, road based orders are coming from customers that want it come hell or high water. Even if it's a bad customer experience and it's expensive. And the U S customer is paying nearly a 60 percent premium on basket value to get that pizza delivered. And they're never happy with it, but look, 5. 2 billion orders. So that's the current market. Our estimate puts it at a 16 billion order market without even trying, if we can remove the road from the equation and use aircraft. So you tell me one industry where you have probably a hundred billion dollar market staring at you in the face that's untapped, where the technology has proven we've already got positive uni economics. And the only thing between us and that giant market, I guess there's a social acceptance thing. You can't go too fast, too quickly. There's some regulatory, things still to unlock. But if you side that up beside blood delivery or vaccine delivery or whatever, it just dwarfs that space. And we didn't want to take on something easy. We wanted to take on the most impactful, space and that is everyday goods to everyday people in every suburban house on the planet profitably. And we're at the start of that now.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The other thing that strikes me about the coffee and the last mile consumer delivery is that you have the opportunity for a very consistent operation in order to make deliveries into all those customers in the market. By and large, they're already accustomed to ordering things from their phone from the ground based delivery aggregators. And in contrast, when we went and looked into the B2B medical delivery space, at least in the developed world, the companies face a pretty involved enterprise integration and organizational integration for each customer or each segment of customers. How is that flight operation going to work? Who is going to have the authority to initiate a flight? All of it ends up being a pretty heavy front load, cost and integration and it's heterogeneous operations as the business grows. Whereas in this it seems you already have a foundation of educated consumers accustomed to receiving deliveries via phone operations and it lays the groundwork for a reasonable path to go and scale a company to go and address that market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and there's no, enterprise sales process or there's no finding a budget somewhere in some hospital or some company's budget to try and do this innovative new mode. Our customers are the ones that are drinking the coffee. And they're abundant and they're aware of us and it's viral and all of these tailwinds to what we're doing that don't exist in the enterprise market. And then the other thing is we, again, we look at different densities. So European population density is much higher than US population density in suburbs. So for example, in Europe, we use a lot of motorbikes to move blood around between hospital critical to beat the traffic and it's very hard to justify, you know, why would you spend a large infrastructure budget and drones when the motorbike network's already there, largely run by volunteers. it's just sometimes forcing technology into a place where technology doesn't belong. Now different in Africa or, you know, countries that don't have transport infrastructure anyway. And of course there, you're not providing drone delivery. You're providing transport infrastructure. But there's already solid transport modes in most modern economies that are not as good as drone delivery, but they're not far off. So your benefits are marginal. And then you're incurring, as you said rightly, all this overhead of cold chain of all the trail of every part of the process for that sample or whatever it is. And then of course, toxic substances. a lot of the products you might want to fly in medical areas are considered hazardous substances, so, chemotherapy drugs is a great use case, but you're into a whole other area of risk there. And we just said, look, there's parts of that prize that we're interested in and we also liked the fact that it's a critical need to deliver those products, but at the same time, it comes with just such difficult challenges on the economic side of things that from my view, it's always going to be a business that's subsidized by something. And that's, I think, why it succeeded so well in Africa to date. And I think honestly, it's going to be challenged in other markets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I may say something really quickly, we can move on from this. As it relates to medical delivery, and in clinical pathology versus anatomic pathology, so blood versus tissue, I think an argument could be made that there's high volume of both, and tissue pathology will have a much higher critical factor, and there'll be a lot of price behind that, because there's a sensitivity to it where that may be a good market. I think they're both relatively high volume, but one difference between a cup of coffee is that the economics may not play out unless there's a lot of volume in the delivery. They're not going to pay a lot for one piece of blood, and I think one thing we discovered, Luka and Peter, on one of our podcasts was what's the real value of getting it there a little bit faster when it's a 24 hour turn on the testing anyway? But my sense is that the, and Bobby, in hospitals, labs, there's a very large cost item set aside for courier.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's a big element for labs. So maybe that's a next stage for you if the economics play out, but that meets a lot of your criteria, conceivably clinical and anatomic pathology, maybe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. I mean, I'd love to be, I'm not sure I'll be proven wrong here. What I'm, I guess in the end, what I'm saying is if you're going to build an infrastructure then you underwrite the cost of an infrastructure with a viable business case, and then all the other applications can work on top of that. So if you're already in a city or a suburb or whatever it is, and you're flying trivial products, albeit you're making money doing it, why wouldn't you then deploy that for other use cases? It could be beer. It could be medicine, like you say, samples, all of these things. And we can pick products up as well as drop them off. And why wouldn't you deploy? Of course you would. But you don't start with that because you're always going to be building a business that needs to be subsidized by something. And again, it comes back to ambition and scale. And for us, the ambition is unlimited. And we say, what is the biggest use case that we can solve? And it is, no matter what you say. It's always going to be the suburban household and their needs. And that's going to be what will underwrite the infrastructure for any successful player in this space. It ain't going to be medical.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>19:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, you talk about the potential to expand the market from what 5. 2 billion deliveries per year today with the ground based aggregators to something much larger. When you look at the differences that drone delivery brings into the equation, whether it's speed or environmental advantages or a safety case or cost, what do you see as being the key drivers that are creating the behavior change that leads you to think that there's a 16 billion a year, delivery opportunity?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">There's existing numbers that show adoption rates of road based delivery between 4 and 5% around the world and they kind of point to a low take up rate and there's our own data as well. and there's different states. I think that the restaurants are a small business. Think the consumer at the end of it all. And you look at the different things that they think are important. And in the case of the restaurant, restaurants frequently, they just can't, they can't get delivery, right? It's just too expensive. They can't do it themselves. The aggregators that power them, the, DoorDashes and Ubers and so on, that power them and themselves are constrained with output as well, if it rains, if the weather's bad in any way, or if it's peak time, you just can't meet the demand peaks, with people, it just doesn't work. So the result is batching, where multiple orders are put in with one driver and therefore cold food or terrible quality food and unpredictable times. And that's reflected in the NPS or the ratings of all of the aggregators, which are on the floor, not because they're not great businesses. They are, but they're constrained by just a limited output that they have. So why are we different? Because we're point to point. our average flight time is just less than three minutes. Physics is on our side. And when you have that advantage, the outcome is look, it's literally as simple as the outcome is hot food or hot coffee or, and in good condition. And that is remarkably the most important thing. It isn't speed. It will speed kind of translates into quality, but also reliability and predictability, which is as important as quality. People are willing to wait 15 minutes or 20 minutes. They are willing so long as that's what it is. But with batching and traveling, the traveling salesman algorithm, there's no way to be sure about that. So, so the variability is very poor. And so the consumer is going to modify their behavior because of drone delivery and the advantages it has. And we already see that in something as simple as coffee delivery. And before we existed, there was no such thing as coffee delivery in suburbs. That nobody would be crazy enough to do that because you won't make any money but yet our basket value in our coffee shop is more than twice the the basket value of the average order in the coffee shop itself, because behavior, right? It's a household order. So it's 2. 3 beverages per basket. There's a bunch of pastries and so on and then the other stakeholder for us, as I said, the vendor, the small business, they're looking at this saying they're now able to reach a couple of hundred thousand up to half a million customers in their catchment area of less than a five minute flight. And they're saying this is massive for their business. So. That's another stakeholder. And then the final stakeholder for us is the aggregator itself. And we'd expect our business is going to be, we call it B2B. And what we mean by B2B is we just want to be a delivery company. So we want to power the aggregators. We want to power the big brands. We have a deal with Coca Cola where we fly their products, but we want to power all of the big and the small brands directly, simply replacing the road. And so you think about the aggregators and their numbers are public. The aggregators lose money on most of their orders in suburbs because of the time it takes to deliver them and the labor costs and the labor laws. So we know the benefits to them are actually simply unit economics. we can do a delivery for them cheaper than they can do it themselves quite simply, and still make a strong margin ourselves because of our operating economics. So there's different stakeholders, but it, and some of them, it's about economics and some of them it's about experience and quality, and some of it, it's about growing the market. And by the way, the five to 16 primarily comes from number one is actually just widening the addressable market. So you're going from where the aggregators really only want to do very dense areas and quite short trips to obviously optimize their costs. We can now do much longer trips and support much less population dense areas. So you're actually widening the market to those like 92 million detached single family homes in the USA. And similarly in Europe, there's these really fragmented towns, suburb cities that aren't that easy to address for the traditional mode. So it's a combination of just customer behavior, I think, and market addressability.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, you answered the question, but I was going to ask if there are categories of products that people just wouldn't consider ordering via ground based delivery because they just know it's going to take too long, like a latte or something. And are you seeing that people will order those products given their expectation that it will arrive faster via a drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, we survey them as well. And quite interesting. If you look at lots of publicly available data, the key categories for road based delivery are, in order, if I just pick one market, the UK, where there's great data. And it's quite similar in the USA as well, but there's the top one is pizza. And then it's, other products like Indian or Chinese and burgers and fries is like fourth or fifth in the list of, perishable prepared meals. But actually if you ask people what they want to eat, burgers and fries is the number one thing. So what's going on there is people already know that certain products just don't deliver well, they don't travel well, and anyone that's got a road based delivery of burgers and fries knows that after 20 minutes, it's just toxic. So, so therefore you can't reheat it either. So, so consumers know not to order these things. So in the existing road based data, there's a hidden demand that's there that's not satisfied. We know that already from ours. And our number one, outside of coffee, our second one is probably tied between burgers and fries and ice cream. And an ice cream is an interesting one because you don't need a lot of choice in ice cream, right? You just need a quality, well known brand or two for the customer. But ice cream is interesting because it's 168 hours of the week almost, it's almost flat by hour of day of week. And it's driven by family orders, right? These are orders that have an experience associated with them, like a party or watching a movie or things like that. And the alternative is getting your car for 35 or 40 minutes to get the ice cream if you don't happen to have it. So we do see people now starting to rely on us for certain categories like coffee and ice cream that they might've pre purchased a week at a time and stored it in their fridge before, and now they just don't care cause they can get it from us and then the really the alarm bells, I think in a good way that ring for us is that burgers and fries in terms of meals are number one category. And finally, I would say people are saying, finally, I can get French fries. It actually tastes like French fries and they arrive. And I know that sounds trivial, but it isn't. It's the flagship product of McDonald's, right? I mean, French fries. I started this business because I wanted a bag of French fries and we call them chips in Ireland. I joke about it, but I did. And it's one of those, highly sought after products that delivery just fails.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>27:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I mean, Uber is a great case study in how an addressable market can expand when you introduce a new capability or a new user experience. I don't have the data to back this up, but I'm just basing this on my own consumption patterns and those close to me, but I'd be comfortable saying that a lot of Uber users their budgets for taxi and black cars prior to Uber were not the same as their Uber budgets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And the amount of music people consume now, it's Spotify. there's things that consumers never would have told you they wanted until you gave it to them and then they're absolutely reliant on it. It's like air and we'll be the same. We already are in the towns we operate in. It's just, people are blown away by the fact that they can get our service but at the same time, they straight away adjust to it and they start to get angry with us if we're 60 seconds late it almost feels like for some of them. So, so, and that's a good thing. it really is the end of road based delivery. When you offer this service, consumers never going back to road based delivery. And I think that's not unexpected. Our job has been at the engineering level to make sure that no matter what the weather is, they wouldn't need to go back. So that means flying in minus 20 C plus 42 C, very strong winds, I think 35 mile an hour winds, things like that, rain, obviously snow. And if you don't do all of those things and really from an engineering point of view, harden the product, you don't have a business. There's no point being a drone delivery business for fair weather because the restaurants and the customers that you're powering, they'll just, they just, if you, if they can't trust that you're going to always be there, you're a novelty, you're the circus. And that's not who we want to be. So you have to start with the very hardest of solutions and an engineer for that. And when I think about what advice I would give people, you can't start in this business with a halfway house. You have to have the final, picture solved. That's a mistake we nearly made at the start. And just by sheer luck, we happen to be in Ireland, which is the worst country in the world to do a drone delivery business, permanently raining, permanently windy. So therefore we can fly in any weather, but it comes back to, and it's very important. I know it sounds like engineering, but I'm trying not to be too engineering about this. But if you want to be real in drone delivery you have to replace the car fully. You can't be partial replacement. And that makes it much more difficult. The engineering equation is just much harder and the testing equation is much harder. Even the delivery mode, the way we deliver the software we've written for that arrival at the house and delivering, it looks simple. but it's not, it's quite the opposite. And then testing that out in the wild and, is one thing in a big field in the middle of nowhere, but testing it where there's customers underneath you, is a whole other thing. And that takes so much time. Sorry, I'm wondering, but it goes to what do you need to solve for, right? You need to solve for predictability, availability, speed equals quality, cost, unit cost, and yeah. So safety, I don't even talk about safety because you don't have a right to exist, if you're not safe and that comes down to, yes, we have governance because we're regulated by aviation regulators and a lot of oversight comes from that. But. It doesn't make you safe. There's a million ways to still not be safe, even if you're regulated. I think that comes from, there's a, there's an existential threat hanging over the industry if it's irresponsible when it starts to scale. And what that translates to, It took us five years and I don't think you're going to do much quicker than that. And when you start developing a backyard delivery product to, to really scaling it, which is where we are now, it's somewhere between three to five years timeline. And no amount of fantastic engineering, or engineers speed that up. It's a process of gradually evolving, crawl, walk, run more and more volume. You can't please the investors with this one. You have to manage them and let them know that it's a long, arduous process to make sure that you're safe. And I certainly see that in the industry, we've done a great job at that. I don't see anyone pretending that it can go, at blitz scaling pace, but it will, and I think there's a number of, operators like ourselves, like Wing, for example, Google's program that are now ready to start some really, serious growth in a safe way. So, but it is not your typical industry where a five year path normally to a startup, building a viable product with viable economics and the start of a revenue journey. That's very difficult, space by any measure. And so it'll come to what's the market look like in, in a decade, who'll be there, how many will be there, that kind of thing. Just because you mentioned the word safety, what it translates to is a market that's going to be a very few number of players with sufficient deep pockets and patience to get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, Bobby, delving into the customer experience a little bit more. Are you, guiding customers towards expectations for how long it will take for different categories of products to arrive from the time that they push order on their phone? What is a reasonable expectation for a latte versus a hamburger and fries versus other takeout food. Obviously the drone delivery operation itself is a consistent time period, but the preparation time and the other\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">what should customers be expecting?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. There's a very difficult problem to solve actually and the big aggregators have, have done the best job at this simply because of time and the data that they have. Truth is a restaurant that's preparing meals is a very unpredictable output line, particularly smaller ones. And from a day to day or hour to hour basis, quite difficult to predict. Now there's some very large brand players. I don't need to name names, you know, they are, but they can produce a meal every 20 seconds and they can get one through their drive through every 35 seconds. And so for those types of brands, we can tell the customer down to the minute when they can expect to see their nuggets or their fries or whatever it is land in their back garden, essentially for the others, and we have a number of vendors that are, they're a super product, but they're erratic to say the least. So we tell the customer it's a three minute flight or a two minute flight or whatever it is based on the range and the wind. And then we say, and the prep time for this restaurant is between five minutes and you know, with Google flights, you get this kind of bar chart of likely we give them a bar chart of likely arrival times based on the vendor's prep time. And we tell them what's happening as well. So they know in our app or through our API with our B2B partners, they know when the vendor started to prepare, they know when the vendors finished preparing, they know when we've received the goods from the vendor. They know when it's been loaded onto the aircraft. They know when the aircraft's taken off and then they can track it in real time. So the reason we do all of those things is the customer can always see progression and that's important. So the customer does not mind waiting 15 minutes 20 minutes for their burgers and fries, so long as you keep them updated on that progress. And so we measure time by stages, but if I look at my order to arrival time. So it's a time the customer pressed the purchase button to the arrival time. We see a range for products like our Coca Cola delivery, the median time for the aircraft to take off after the order is two minutes. Flight time is three minutes. So, so median time about five minutes all the way up to the premium, we've got this French guy that makes these, delicious sandwiches, but he takes 20 minutes to make the sandwich, but again, it isn't about the actual time. It's about the confidence in that time. And look, our NPS, our net promoter score is 86 year to date. And that's because we have this obvious advantage that we fly, but also we manage, as you say, the customer expectations very clearly. through constant messaging of progression of their\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay. So as you scale and demand increases, how do you keep customer expectations realistic? If it's coming up on lunchtime and you get a bunch of, order interest coming in and you have only so much, delivery capacity during that hour and that, beyond a certain amount, deliveries are going to be delayed simply because you're waiting for a free drone to go and make that flight. How do you prevent customer disappointment with the experience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And we have an advantage there over road as well, because we know if we look forward at the next 60 minutes and we calculate capacity in the next 60 minutes for any given GPS points, we know pretty accurately how many orders we can handle for the next 60 minutes. And that's the window where, it's actually between 30 and 60 minutes where a customer will say, I'm not willing to wait that long. I'll drive myself or I'll do without. So the first and foremost, there's no point adding capacity blindly if you don't know how to assess it in real time. So the way we look at it is we continually add capacity in units, as our repeat cohort of customers grows, so too does our volume, orders per hour, per day of week, and that's pretty easy to anticipate, and we just allocate extra capacity ahead of time. Overcapacity for us isn't such an issue when you look at the aircraft utilization, because we don't care so much about an aircraft sitting on the tarmac. We care about the people's cost, the people cost that would load that aircraft cargo, they're there anyway. So when we flex up and down capacity, it's more about flexing up and down the people that manage or load cargo or monitor those aircraft than the actual aircraft themselves.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the most utilization sensitive component of your operation is utilization of your human labor, not utilization of your airframes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Correct. Yeah, we don't really care about utilization of the airframes. I mean, we do, but in the end, don't forget we have mobile aircrafts. Our aircraft can load balance from one cell to the other. In other words, the aircraft can autonomously go from one location to another to serve demand in different locations. So we can dynamically allocate the fleet to. And there's other great use cases like parcel delivery, postal delivery, for example, and pharmacy delivery, even that you can take orders with a four hour window on them and just send them in underutilized slots. So we can balance our utilization through the day, particularly daytime hours. So I think as we grow, there'll be more of those what we call latent orders that have a window of delivery time that don't need instant delivery that we will use our fleets to fly. So I'm not too concerned about the aircraft itself. It's the people and we have two modes of operation. We have one where we're highly centralized, all the aircraft and a handful of people. And also, for example, one of our people can load between 20 and 30 flights per hour. So that's our number, right? and 20 or 30 flights per hour is the best you're going to do because our turnaround time is between 30 and 60 seconds, right? Aircraft landing, aircraft taking off and that you can't beat that. No, there's no way to beat that number. But that's the cost, right? That's that person's cost for those 20 or 30 deliveries. And you want them fully utilized. So if you're over budgeted on those people, then you're going to increase your cost per delivery. So that's the way to think about it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, what's been the biggest change in the drone delivery market in the last two years since we talked?

And like I said, I always, I'm not a great mathematician, but if you scale a negative number, you get a larger negative number, no matter how hard you try. no, look, we already have$4 in and around sometimes less, sometimes more dependent time of the week and the cargo cost per delivery fully loaded. Right. That's, and we're going to, by the way, publish this data, both on LinkedIn and through our friends at McKinsey. And so you'll see it and, but you can also see a very clear path to$2 cost for delivery, like literally with our eyes closed, we won't get there at the end of this year. We won't be far off it, but even limited scaling will bring us to a$2 cost per delivery. And what we want to win at is that, going back to the Warren Buffett, right, in a commodity world and drone delivery, ultimately, at scale and over 20 years commodity, right, it's A to B safely and quickly. The winner will be the ones that have the best cost of operation. This is why Ryanair succeeded, is why Southwest did so well in the earlier days. And we learned from history of running businesses that it's not the coolest product that's going to win in this space. Nobody cares. it's about the cost. So, so what's changed, I think we've demonstrated in superb fashion that the industry is viable, economically viable, and I think that's important. And then I think regulatory wise, again, we now fly BVLOS all over Europe. We have license all over Europe. Europe has really strong, difficult, but really clear regulations. USA has moved forward at pace as well. We see pretty much everyone operating with 135s, we see Google really starting to expand their operations, we see major brands like Walmart really leaning into it, so I would say ahead of expectations in Europe, for sure, and what we would have predicted in the USA as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What about a disappointment, Bobby?

I would love to see, and we would love to be flying under 108, very soon, but, still uncertain and uncertainty kills an industry like ours, well, it doesn't kill it, but it just makes it very difficult for companies like us to continue to grow and raise money to grow when there's uncertainty around the regulatory environment. And so 108's a discipline. Well, it's not a disappointment. It's great. We love it. It's the right shape. It feels exactly what the industry needs to scale. It's just hard to say when those, rules will be written and we'll go through the process and become, routine. So is it a disappointment? No, like I'm pretty happy that we have BVLOS in Europe. There's, 500 million people here, 300 million of which we can reach. so there's plenty of business. And I would say to any drone delivery company. get over here and start flying. Like Google are flying a mile away from my house here, where I'm recording this from, Europe is a fantastic place to build some scale. It's not as great a market the USA, it's a market where you can really get flying anyway. So, so disappointments, they're not really disappointments. They're just, it's the, I just wish it could all move a little bit more quickly in the USA. and other than that, I think we're in really strong shape.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How should we make sense of the different operating cost numbers that we see in the industry media or being talked about across the different companies that are doing this? From your vantage point, do you know if they're all being formulated the same way? Are we talking about apples to apples or apples to oranges with these numbers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think, there's some wishful thinking in some of the things that I've, seen. I would say, remembering WeWork and community adjusted EBITDA is the phrase I would think of here. You have to include packaging cost, battery motor depreciation, prop depreciation, maintenance, aircraft depreciation, personnel, all of the other costs, but those are the main ones that I listed there. If all of those aren't in your unit economics there's already a problem and particularly aircraft depreciation. So again, that goes to our aircraft has a useful life of 75, 000 deliveries. And that means that our depreciation factor is relatively low. And that's an intentional part of our product design, even battery management, battery maintenance, those ones should be equal for everybody, right, because we're all using lithium ion in some way. And we're charging them at different speeds, discharging them at different speeds, but largely speaking, while we think we're better than most on battery, I think you could pretty much assume that everyone's the same in that regard. I think where all of the players differ greatly is in longevity of the aircraft, how many cycles you're going to get from the aircraft. It's throughput per hour. And that comes to hot swap architecture or not hot swap and then charging in situ kind of the opposite of hot swap. Charging in situ means that your battery won't last as long. And after the person loading the cargo, battery is your biggest unit cost. And what I mean by that is if you're charging a battery in sub zero temperatures, or if you're charging a battery in very high temperatures, it's not going to live as long as a battery that's charged at a consistent temperature indoors. And that comes down to aircraft architecture and operational architecture. In other words, hot swap battery, the battery's only outdoors for 60 seconds before it flies. We've thought about all of that and we've thought about it because of our focus on unit costs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so you're treating batteries and motors as consumables. Those are not going 75, 000 flights. Those are being replaced periodically, but it's the remainder of the aircraft that you assert has a 75, 000 flight life. Okay, so how many flight hours, just from an aviation standpoint, comparing the expected life of this aircraft in terms of flight hours? How many is that? Roughly 15, 000 flight hours?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's a divide by eight, divide by eight. We do eight flights an\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">hour So what is the remainder of that airframe? What data do you have that, gives you confidence that this is a 75, 000 flight item? And what's your approach to continued airworthiness and maintenance of that object over that time?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Data. So our old aircraft, we call it the 3.8, was a 20, 000 flights aircraft. And we've never written one off before that, but we have many of them that have done more than that. We've a couple of aircraft over 20, 000, 25, 000 flights each. So we have formed there. We know what are the things to engineer for. When you talk about our newer aircraft, which we call 3.8.4 really it's functionally no different than our old aircraft, except for the propulsion system, which is a, it's a much easier maintenance system because most of the failures in our previous aircraft came down to wear and tear during maintenance, during routine changes of parts of the subsystem, props or, motors. So our new aircraft airframe, a single piece of carbon fiber, no moving parts. And that is easy to cycle, right? It's very easy to cycle that airframe through actually half a million flight cycles, on simulator on test benches, should I say, and get the data. And that's the process for evaluating what the lifetime of each component is. You're right, our motors and our batteries and props actually, for that matter, are in our unit cost. So we write off motors after 2000 hours. We write off batteries, in a number of flights, a number of cycles. So it's very predictable. And props less predictable although there's expected lifetime for props, it's mostly, preemptive, I would say monitoring for imperfections or damage to props and changing, but it's stack ranked it's battery, motor, props. And then we apply just a consistent percentage overhead to the entire bill of materials on the aircraft outside of that annual cost, which is quite conservative to get the look, this cable failed or that, that LIDAR unit failed or whatever, because components fail individually and in very unpredictable ways. And so I think the right approach there is just apply a consistent proportion of the overall bill of materials in an annual tax almost in form of maintenance and component switching. And we're, we've been in this five years, we think we have very good data on that. So we're, and as I said, we're quite conservative on it, but it's still overall the depreciation of the entire system for per flight is quite low. It's certainly lower than the person loading the cargo. And then continued airworthiness or maintenance and, the traditional aviation part of things, I would say our old aircraft or existing aircraft depending on what you're day you're operating on, is an aircraft that required a lot of overhead, a lot of maintenance inspections, frequent inspections, frequent overhauls. And we moved now to our new aircraft that just self diagnoses everything, designed for high throughput, long time without even an inspection. But it still backs down to very traditional aviation practices for keeping aircraft in the air and ensuring that they're safe. We, I don't think we're any different there than company that flies small planes or helicopters in the processes, the training, all that stuff that happens.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Given that you'll be publishing some numbers soon, are you comfortable sharing with our audience some high level,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Of course I\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">major cost drivers and the specific\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I actually, I predicted you would ask me, so I actually got a breakdown. Yeah. Yeah. Are you ready? Well, why wouldn't I talk about this? Because we, we do the best, right? So, so today,$4.27 cost per delivery of which fixed overhead, 71 cents, labor$1.93 consumables and depreciation,$1.63. That's where we are today. And then by the end of this year, well, look, I don't want to promise too much, but that'll probably be closer to$3 than even$3.50. Yeah. And then if I look at the human costs, so, and this comes to our operation, which again will evolve. We have different roles. So we have what we call a dispatcher, which is what others would call a pilot, that's a person that for us can monitor up to 20 aircraft simultaneously. What role they have? I don't know, because there's no sticks. There's no control of our aircraft, but they're there anyway, monitoring, but our loaders is our biggest cost. So, so that those are people that just take cargo from a vendor, load on the aircraft, just over a dollar per delivery. That's interesting because Ireland, in fact, Europe is a high wage environment, and so our hourly cost for labor is about$18. so if you look at that and then you look at our future system, which does not need those loaders, so when I talk about going from$3 to$2, that loader for us goes away and the vendor loads the cargo. So we're not in a rush to do that. We have the system built, we're happy. But for now we want to operate just highly centralized, very well managed, location. So we have that loader cost. And the number of the$1.63 that I mentioned earlier on in consumables, I can tell you stack ranked in there it's battery is roughly 50 percent of that currently that'll come down a bit with new battery chemistry we have, and then motors is second at about 25% and then maintenance, just a fixed cost of maintenance per flight that we apply and props and replacement components is the remainder of it. And there are some benefits to scale purchasing of these were obviously tiny now in terms of scale of purchasing. So that$1.63 we predict at scale will come down to about 45 cents. And so when we get from$4.27, where we are now, down to$3 or say$2 and 2 cents is the number I'm looking at, the bulk of that comes from reducing our consumables cost by just scale and better purchasing power. And then there's a pretty significant, unlock for us in change of battery chemistry, so going to a more conservative battery chemistry, but one that has a higher number of cycles and that comes from, again, this, we see this as a major advantage that our system has is that we don't need to charge our batteries and anything over 1C. So we can charge them slowly because the aircraft isn't waiting for a charge with us, so we might have seven, eight, nine battery systems, cargo systems per aircraft, and one of them is flying while eight of them are charging, so we can charge them very slowly and therefore get many more cycles out of the battery. And that, that counts in this space. It really does count. The top level architecture we have, we think it is designed for throughput, of course, productivity of real estate space, but also it flows through that because we have this hotswap battery, our costs per delivery are quite a bit lower than I think for people that are charging in situ, but look, those are the numbers. And we're actually going to publish the whole thing in detail for everyone to look at, but there should be no surprises in there. And I think largely our lower cost is driven by our higher throughput per hour.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Are these contribution costs, Bobby, or what costs are not included?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So those are pretty much everything.

So don't forget our cost gets diluted by the number of drones, right? And then that's proportional to the utilization of that same number of drones. So if we've resourced it correctly, in terms of the human loaders, then you need a 55 percent utilization of that capacity to reach those numbers. Those are numbers that we deliver today based on our existing volume.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What does that translate in terms of, daily deliveries per aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we do all of that with less than 300 deliveries a day for our four aircraft.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But there are delivery surges, in the morning, at lunchtime, different parts of the day, and then there are low periods. Is that right?

So volume is what takes care of that, Peter. So you, you reduce. Or should I say you increase the granularity of utilization as volume grows, right? So we already see weekends, for example, we operate 12 hours a day. Weekends are, I wouldn't say I haven't looked last week, but they're north of 90 percent utilization now on weekends. And what we probably should do is add more aircraft and drive more demand, but we are not motivated by volume. We've never been motivated by volume for this stage of the business. We've been always motivated by those KPIs around cost per delivery and optimizing for that. So we're about to open two other bases in the same suburb. So we'll be bringing it up to the gigantic number of 12 aircraft, which doesn't sound like a lot to most folks, but that's a thousand deliveries a day for us, more than a thousand deliveries a day cause they're very productive aircraft. And if we're successful at getting that over time, if we fill that capacity, which we will, once we switch on certain new channels, but think probably across the week, it'll be anywhere from 400 to a thousand real deliveries a day in the suburb. you'll have always have that right, but we'll flex up and down the human resourcing part of that across those, days of the week and hours of the day. And we, we think a natural place to be is about 70 percent utilization and at 70 percent utilization, we're somewhere between 2 and 3 cost per delivery.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You already mentioned that this is all beyond visual line of sight, and that the loaders are the only people involved, so no visual observers. Can you talk about how the, mission execution is done with the supervisors and any progress on the 1:many front.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, for us BVLOS is one to many. And for us, that happened at a year ago where we went from many to one. So we had like two point, two point, whatever people per aircraft down to now, actually practically we think it's probably 20 to one because that person, that resource really doesn't have a role. There's no mission planning. There's no nothing that there's really no role for that person, but we're happy to have that person there anyway, to observe and just to be aware. And there's certain areas, like we fly in controlled airspace as well. And Europe has this thing called U-Space. And we've worked with the folks in Google and in Wing with this as well, about de confliction and then bringing that de confliction up a level to ADS B IN to avoid traditional aircraft. Today, we do all in an automated way, but we'd also use that observer to observe the airspace, the ADS B traffic. But like I said, that cost is ultimately going to disappear completely because there's no role really there. Mission planning is automated for us, so when a customer signs up with us we don't see them. We don't talk to them. There's no interaction. they drop a pin where they would like us to deliver. And then we use data to decide if that pin is a safe place or not. And they're in the system. And when the aircraft flies to them, we do check while we're there to make sure the area is clean. In other words, it's less than a 15 degree angle. It's inanimate. There's no people underneath. And all that's automated for us so that there's no observers required. The mission planning is quite interesting actually because there's a couple of things that are surprisingly innovative in that space. I would like to say rocket science, but it's not rocket science, but the flight planning to optimize for energy use, depending on prevailing wind is important. And then we stream the weather from the aircraft that are in the air. So we have very accurate, very localized and very real time weather data that informs the next flight. And so that's a really important optimization for us in both speed of delivery, but also in, in energy drawn, which allows us to have that nice wind envelope or nice wind capability. And so that's very important, but another equally important part of what we do is mitigating ground risks. So, we have an effective population density where we fly. Like it is very populated where we fly. It is very dense. It's as dense as the Bronx or Queens, for example. It is really dense. And we're flying over about 450 houses with every single flight. So we take ground mitigation very seriously. And we do a lot of work there. And one of the feeds that we have is real time location data from users of our code, of our apps that they give us permission to have, and we'll monitor the space for hotspots of people. And that's a really important addition to what we've done. And so that data tells us, like, for example, if there's a beer garden, there's 500 people drinking beer outdoors in the middle of the summer. And we'll know they're there and we'll automate the flight plan around that. And so that for us has proven to be quite an easy thing to build where data didn't exist before. You couldn't really get that insight into where people were before. And in an anonymous way use it to mitigate your flights. So the flight planning is quite interesting in our world. And then the other part is aside from risk, just pure ground risk mitigation. You always think about, you don't want to be flying over the same places all the time. You want to avoid channels down certain areas to overbother people. So we ran, I wouldn't say randomized, but we, in the flight planning, we do a lot of work to reduce the effect of overflights. And that's been a key part of the acceptance aspect of what we're doing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What third party software are you using, Bobby, in that process?

I suppose our strength as a team has been in software, our businesses before have all been software businesses and either way, I think, if there was available software to buy in that space, we'd probably have bought it if it met our needs. But you have to balance always with software. The difference between software that's 95 percent what you need and 100 percent what you need is probably five years. I'm a programmer myself. That's my trade. It's often better just to build a simple system that exactly meets your needs, then adopt a complex system that more or less meets your needs. And in our case, like it is not rocket science where we're building, we're not going to be famous for how awesome our software or our hardware is. That's not what we're going to be famous for. We're going to be famous for our lowest unit cost and our ability to scale that, I think. But to answer your question, we use zero third party software.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm curious, I have to ask, have AI coding assistant technologies made an impact on your organization's ability to write this software?

I wouldn't call it strategic. I would call it an optimization. We're faster writing code. We're better at testing code. It just reduces the time to write code, but once code is written, the AI is no use to you and, we have a mature platform now, so we're more I'd say tinkering, we're optimizing doing small additions and it's very difficult to let an AI into existing code and start adding things. It's more when you write it from the start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Does it tilt the equation between building your own software versus buying software? The decision you would have made three years ago versus the decision that you will make three years in the future on that question.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I don't think so. no, it, it just, when you're assessing the number of people you need, or more importantly, you might get a, someone that's a, an average to strong programmer up a level. You might, get individuals just up a level. Like some of the code I would have written recently, and I use ChatGPT or Copilot, to write some of my own code. I'm writing code now that takes two or three days. That might've taken me a couple of weeks to write before. Mostly now when you're writing code, you're using frameworks or APIs that already exist to take a lot of learning, to take a lot of time to get to use, particularly in the AI and the vision space, and that's just like, I wrote some code recently myself that, that used our security cameras to look for people walking close to an aircraft or onto one of our landing pads. That code took me less than two days to get into production. And that's something that would have taken me a month to write before. And I'm, programming 35 years. So, so think about it that way. And I think that's the only right way to think about it. Just, it just makes existing good programmers faster and better. It doesn't replace the programmer. And so your decision, whether to buy versus build would more be about if somebody has matured a platform already that has done a scale drone delivery operation, it automatically by that fact will have evolved into the right piece of software for us, and I would buy that all day long, but nobody has written a piece of software that runs a drone delivery business at scale yet, except us. And I would say Wing. And so would I buy wing software? Yes. I would buy Wing's software, but I wouldn't buy anyone else's because the software evolves in line with the way you use it and you have to use it in order to develop it, I think.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You mentioned earlier that the consumer pays upwards of maybe 60 percent of the value of the meal with traditional, terrestrial food delivery. How does the drone economics impact, the wallets of the customers and the restaurants?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that, that number comes from actually a McKinsey work in the USA where they measured and it's, yeah, it's a 55 to 60 percent increase. So you buy a pizza for$30, you're paying$45 or a little bit more. In our case, we, I mean, you can get our app, we're charging customers$5 a delivery. And we haven't seen it. That's a little bit more expensive than they might pay for that direct. Here's my delivery fee number on the ticket. but we don't mark up the menu. We don't add surcharges. There's no tip obviously for the drone. So to the customer, actually, we're probably on a par with existing road based delivery, the way they might see it. Now it's only in the USA that everyone pays this gigantic premium on basket. In Europe they're paying about$7 fully loaded, but with tip and all that stuff. And so we're kind of in a par and I think a better question is, do we think there's room to charge more? Or do we need to charge less? and I think that's comes down to elasticity of demand. The drone does, favors there. It's really elasticity of demand on consumption, right? Whether they want the hamburger, whether they're willing to get it delivered or go outside. And if we're much more expensive than road based delivery, that's where the elasticity comes in. They're just going to go back to road based delivery. So I think our industry always needs to be on a par at worst with the existing mode or otherwise better. And then that translates again, back to our unit cost story. We think there's a world where a subscription is a real thing in drone delivery. And that's where we'd like to be. We'd ultimately like every household in the world uses us like Amazon Prime or like Spotify or just part of their monthly, thing in the household. And we think we can get marginal costs down to the point where that will work. And just like Prime or just like Spotify this is an almost inconsequential monthly cost for a household and we can use that to subsidize deliveries and still make our money by charging our partners a commission on basket value. So, we see enormous upside in the take rate or the revenue per delivery without needing to increase the cost to the consumer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How do you expect unit cost numbers that you shared with us to change in the U.

In Europe, that means implementation of U-Space. The regulations are there, U-Space is there. It's just rolling it out, but there's already four or five countries in Europe that will have U-Space this year. And USA, I think that Part 108 is the answer for scale. I don't think 135 is, although there can be the initial growth and scaling in the USA, which I think we'll all do a little bit of, but true, unlimited, unconstrained scaling, I think needs 108. So that's the bits that are out of our control. I think everything else is just execution. It's a capital intensive world, so you need a lot of capital to scale this, even though it's got a good return on it. Like our capital returns in 14 months when we open a new location, it's funded itself after 14 months. But you still, as we're growing a lot, you're going to need, a lot of capital to fund that growth. And I think debt will be a big part of that finance of the aircraft, just like in aviation. So will that be a constraint? Probably not. So then you move on to, again, the things that are in our control, but will quickly get out of our control. If we don't act properly and responsibly as an industry and as individual operators, we'll be punished by regulation. Cities will slow us down like they did the scooter industry. If there's accidents or, anything really that worries people, that will slow us down. So there's a risk there that with the rise of good regulation and the issuing of licenses that people might try to go too fast when they're not ready. They're rushing to get an aircraft to market. They start flying it and they ruin the party for everyone else. If anything slows us down in a material way, that will be it. And will it happen? I doubt it because I think the regulator on both sides of the pond have been very thoughtful about this. And I don't think anyone will be allowed to fly at scale unless they're safe. I just don't see a world where, you're going to have, people allowed to take risk. We obviously are not going to, but I don't think it's a world where you're going to have small operators that raise a seed round and start flying around communities. I don't think that's going to happen at all. I see this being an industry of two or three big players worldwide that will operate properly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby in three years, are you a$15 million,$50 or a$500 million revenue company?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In three years,$100 million plus, I would hope to think, and that could very well be all in Europe as well with some of the contracts we've signed and with the state of the market here, there's every possibility that we could get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And at a hundred million, you're a top three player you're saying in the world?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In drone delivery, we want to be the number one.

If we just got to a thousand of them, that's a billion dollars revenue business and with a contribution that pays for itself in 14 months.

So it isn't, obviously the marginal cost of a unit is there always. We have to manufacture, we have to deploy the boots on the ground. It's a difficult business to scale. I compare us to a Starbucks rollout back to the Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz was on the podcast recently and he broke the numbers down and he said, look, it's half a million for us to generate a million dollars in revenue. It takes two years to pay back. And so he's all about debt financing and trying to go fast, but just it's slow. And I think we won't be as badly affected by that, but that's naturally difficult part of scaling our business. It'll take a while to get to a billion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already touched on this in the conversation about availability, there's, two potential paths that somebody in this industry might take in terms of how deep in a given geography they want to go, whether they want to offer a full capacity service to the customer in one smaller area or expand a little bit more aggressively, but not go perhaps as deep. How do you think about that trade off?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we think about kind of Goldilocks suburb of hundred thousand people and up, potentially we could make slightly smaller ones work. So think 50, 000 people and up. And if you look at that as a filter, there's some other ones like number of restaurants within a hundred meter radius of an anchor restaurant, an anchor tenant, things like that. But if you filter it down, you come to about 10, 000 locations, as I said, in Europe alone, that, that are viable for us to deliver a minimum number of, orders. so, and then if you say, okay, from a strategy point of view, do you want a thin layer? That means then you have that incumbency, advantage in, in many markets at once or as fast as possible, or as you said, do you just own a handful of markets such that they're impenetrable and you don't share them with anyone? And we've seen that play out in food delivery, in the USA and then later on in Europe. We've seen the way it goes. Each market gets its own lead player. And then 10 years on, there's consolidation for efficiency reasons, mostly, and you end up with two or three players in the region, in the continent. And I think there's a potential where if we just stayed in the main European markets, that a smaller business will start up in Sweden and one in Spain or whatever, we'll and for us anyway, we don't want to let that happen. We want to go slightly thinner in more geography, early than going deep. And primarily because we learned from the previous two industry scooters and, food delivery, and you could argue mobility as well. So, on demand rides where if you leave a market alone, something will grow there, and then you're postponing a problem of either competition on economics or, competition on marketing and owning the customer, and I think it's better therefore it's not a black and white, but I think generally we would favor going wider and more shallow. That's a stronger position to be in.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just to make sure I understand when you say that shallower and wider, do you mean not saturating a metropolitan area with presence in every suburb, but, perhaps a few suburbs but you're not thinking that, okay, once I'm in one of those suburbs the shallowness will be a characteristic of the service that you offer such that the risk is that you disappoint customers when they go to the app and say, oh, okay, great. Thanks. I can't get the service. I'm disappointed.

It'll be the aggregators and the vendors won't give them a choice because it's a lot cheaper for them to fulfill that order. So when we say shallow, in an area, it means we go to a large city we'll do all of the suburbs over 50 to a hundred thousand people, but the suburb that's only 25, 000 or less, they're not getting the service because we'd prefer to be growing to the other suburbs in Madrid and Berlin and Stockholm and so on\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right.

You've got these real, tiny little restaurants tucked away in corners. And there's just, you're not going to get an aircraft there, but we'd like to think the 60th or 70th percentile of volume, we'd be able to get, and that in terms of volume of, or choice translates to less than 50 percent of choice. or percentage of restaurants in the area that you'd need to care about. But don't forget it. Go back to coffee.

And as you think about advanced air mobility overall, let's say we break it down to a couple of different buckets. Let's say military drones, let's say commercial drone delivery, whether it be coffee, medical or the like. Or three, let's call it eVTOL, STOL let's say those are three big segments of AAM. What excites you and let's say you were an investor and you had to invest your money. I will assume you will say commercial coffee drone delivery will be an early candidate for investment. What would be next and what would be last?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">My next, without a doubt, in fact, if I wasn't doing this now or I wanted to do something new, it'd be military, defense, look at Anduril or Look at the geopolitical landscape right now and there's a race for sure to arm countries defensively with technology and that technology without a doubt is going to come in the form of flying robots largely, and that's going to have myriad sensor tech, software. It's a software play more than a hardware one. There's obviously a fusing of them, but I find that a really interesting space. And I think, the world is going to be investing a ton of capital in there and the opportunities are enormous and I'm probably unusual in that. I think that's a good thing that industry thrives because it's actually a way to reduce war, not increase war. So that's what I would be doing and I'd be doing it from the USA. cause I think that's where most of the investment's going to happen. So yeah, that's what I would be doing. I wouldn't bet on passenger mobility for a while. I just think it's too hard. I just don't think the physics work well enough yet, and the economics are, I find them difficult to see. You know, they work and it'd be interesting for sure, but I would, I'd be investing in, and working in military defense tech before I'd be doing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As you think about aviation technology, as you think about advanced air mobility, who are the thought leaders out there that you listen to?

I love it. but there's a number of players that, I have huge respect for. I don't want to embarrass them all, but I think, Keller and Zipline has done a super job. I think Adam Woodworth in Wing is an amazing guy. I met him last year. What they've achieved is remarkable. And closer to home, my own team, I have Siggy Zerweckh, 25 years in General Atomics that just, oozes aviation engineering. I'm wowed by the engineers, so you can probably hear that. And thought leadership in the space for me, more important than those, engineering visionary types that I mentioned are the ones that actually understand business as well. And there I'm afraid the industry is guilty of not being real from a business sense, but I have to say, it would be for me, Google and what they've achieved and drone delivery is who I would hold up in the highest regard. And thought leaders, most of your guests, I think, if I look back, you've done a good job of choosing them and I find them really every time I'm surprised, I've never heard of this person. And then suddenly I've met, somebody that's really understands the space better than I could have imagined. So, so many choices.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">One thing I think might be interesting to explore are your thoughts on, the capital that is going to fund the scale out of drone delivery. Right now, it has been primarily funded by venture capital, but clearly there are other types of investors that are going to step in and fund the scale out and thinking about, from your vantage point, who are they, what are the things that they want to see and then what will the financing of the scale out likely look like?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. So I think for who's going to pay to scale it out and what, how does the industry, get the capital it needs to really grow at its natural ability. The numbers are gigantic, right? There's probably a couple of hundred thousand, half a million aircraft are going to be needed in the next five to 10 years, maybe more, maybe less. These are big numbers, in terms of cash needs. I do though, think that the industry lends itself well to venture. We're certainly backed by venture, and we would foresee quite a bit of our future growth. So for us, we'll grow with a blend of debt and venture because we throw off cash now, remarkable as that sounds, we generate cash in a location. So we see ourselves as being probably 60, 70 percent debt funded. So think asset financing type growth and then equity is the other part and private capital for that. So venture. There's an argument that might say, private equity could get there as well. Large private equity firms could get there too. But our ambition is to take the business public as soon as we can. That is a moving feast because public markets are, not in great shape, but by the time we get to that 50 to a hundred million run rate revenue, I think the right thing to do for a business like ours is going to be to IPO because of the profile of investor that's available there. The retail investor will be very important to us as well. The amount of capital we will need to raise to grow it, as I said, to be the leader is enormous. And so it's our ambition to float the company as quickly as we physically can. But I don't think that's in the next two years. It's probably from three years onwards, but there's, there is an outcome where we're floating this business in three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, as we wrap up, what are some of the things that you'd like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the most important thing is the audience to understand that the economics have now been proven for this space. The viability of it has been proven very clearly, that this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That's, that is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think. There has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:26:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Excellent.
