They were \"the guy\". But later, this system integration really enabled them to produce systems that are simply much more performant. If you are not just doing your own manufacturing, but also rather than system integrating components that are produced by other parties, you are actually building all those technology blocks yourself from the chip out and then from within the chip itself, you can start to unlock all these little pockets of efficiency that sit between the black boxes that you would otherwise connect being a system integrator. And it boils down to, in order for these subsystems to be compatible they need to talk over certain protocols, which are designed for interoperability, not necessarily for efficiency, and they're always a compromise. When you have the luxury of owning the black boxes, the two black boxes you need to integrate, then you can open them and you can tweak them and you can optimize for whatever you're optimizing for. And then unlock a tiny bit of efficiency here, tiny bit of efficiency there. And when you look across the whole system, these little efficiencies compound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>2:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">For those in the small UAS space, Orqa is a fairly well known name. Despite maintaining a low public profile, this innovative team from Croatia has been making significant waves in the industry. Starting with ultra low latency, First Person View goggles for the niche drone racing market, Orqa has expanded to build essentially every drone component, including their own drones, through a fully vertically integrated business model. This approach optimizes both cost and performance and is positioning Orqa is a strong Western alternative to DJI. Welcome to another episode of The Vertical Space, where we have the pleasure of speaking with Orqa's CEO and co founder, Srdjan Kovacevic, about the past, present, and future of small UAS in both civilian and defense applications. Srdjan begins by expressing his disagreement with the belief that hardware in the small drone industry will become commoditized. He underscores the crucial role of hardware in achieving peak performance for small aerial robots. And he traces this misconception back to the early days of the consumer drone industry and highlights how DJI's relentless innovation enabled it to dominate the market. The conversation addresses the challenges and opportunities of vertical integration as opposed to system integration, drawing parallels with the mobile phone industry. We delve into specific examples demonstrating the significance of vertical integration in small drones, particularly in the case of ultra low latency video data links. The discussion also explores how market dynamics and geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine are shaping the drone industry. And Srdjan also talks about the intricacies of FPV systems, their application in modern warfare and the potential future developments in drone technology. As mentioned, Srdjan is the CEO and one of the co-founders of Orqa, the world's leading FPV company. Orqa is dedicated to advancing the state of the art in unmanned technologies and remote vision. Before founding Orqa, Srdjan had a distinguished career in the financial industry with over a decade of experience in asset management. He served as the chairman of the management board of Croatia's 150 million Euro sovereign equity fund and was the Head of Risk Management and Compliance at Croatia's largest asset management company. Srdjan earned academic degrees from University of Oxford with a Master's of Science in Mathematical Finance and University of Zagreb with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering He is a certified pension fund manager and certified investment advisor. Enjoy the conversation with Srdjan after a quick sponsor message.

Especially for unmanned, I strongly disagree with that. I don't think hardware is going to be commoditized. I don't think you can ignore hardware. Or, ignore hardware at your peril if you're doing small things that fly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Expand more, please.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Give us some more details. And then how long do you think this will persist?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think this is going to persist until, critical mass of people are proven otherwise. And, if you ask me that fallacy goes back to, 2014 15 so speaking specifically in a small UAS space, in the drone space, right. And I believe you could trace it back to, point where DJI, really, defeated, 3D robotics, and 3D Robotics decided to pivot in software And, despite the, overwhelming proof otherwise, we keep hearing that mantra that, oh, hardware is going to be commodity, so we should focus on software solutions in the drone space, where, it's glaringly obvious that, the way DJI won was by relentlessly focusing on improving hardware from a generation to a generation of the product and, again, I'll say it, neglect hardware at your own peril when it comes to small things that fly. Software a part of the solution, we shouldn't be neglecting software, but I don't think you can achieve the level of performance if you think you can ignore hardware, or run your software somebody else's presumably commoditized hardware.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Why do we hear hardware can be a commodity? And is there any particular part of the hardware that you think is potentially becoming commoditized?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">so I, I think that goes back to the experience that we had with, a PC world or computer world, like hardware is arguably commoditized there, but, then again, it only takes a look at, what Apple is doing to realize that, yeah, hardware can be commoditized, but if you want peak performance, then you need to vertically integrate and you inevitably end up doing your own silicon, which I believe is going to be the case with the small unmanned and by the way, which is what DJI is doing at the moment. In saying that, people are, willfully or unwillingly ignoring, cherry picking the examples that fit to preconceptions. And I think it's just like, one of those things that are so easy to say, so we don't think about when we say them. But I hate hearing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you think that, this argument is true for component level hardware, or are you referring to the art of integrating a hardware product together with all of the, details associated with it, which we will get into more detail later.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's an interesting observation that you ask it like that, and I think, by saying that hardware is going to be commoditized, we gave up on, the possibility that we can compete with DJI, like a collective, rest of the industry and we're settling for a world of commoditized hardware where, we'll just buy components, that should be interoperable and system integrate them in our own solutions. But it's a good question. And I do think, in a world of other drone manufacturers or other drone systems, arguably the base ecosystems, meaning the Pixhawk universe, or Ardupilot universe, or Betaflight universe. All of these subsets have been driving the development of the software stack, autopilot stack, or flight controller firmware stack towards hardware agnostic solutions to a point where, okay, everybody's running on STM, but like on, on a module level. So I think it's also in specifically in the drone world this approach is actually, giving up on the possibility of competing with DJI which was a fair conclusion up until couple of years ago with decoupling and everything.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">From your perspective, how did we end up in the drone industry where we are today, where DJI dominates in a polarized market, dominating both in terms of growth and product quality, while drone companies in the West are having a hard time competing both in performance and price.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think first of all, we need to agree that DJI is just an amazing engineering company, being started by an amazing founder who relentlessly pursued certain goal and would not accept compromises and infuse the company culture with that sort of attitude. And then, going back, I think again, I'm going to go back to what for me was the pivotal moment in the development of the drone market is 2014, 15 3D robotics coming out with the Solo and then DJI countering with the Phantom. I think that was the turning point where all of us users were finally, able to get a really cheap and highly performant vehicles, drones. And DJI has proven that they're going to be super tough to compete with. And, at the time 3D robotics was one of the most funded Silicon Valley companies. And it was being run just like, pretty much every other Silicon Valley company was run, you do your design and your maybe prototyping on shore. And then, you build wherever it's cheapest. And I think it was the pace of innovation that, that was happening in that space, really just shown how having your manufacturing super close to where your R&amp; D is, that just sets you up, to innovate much more rapidly, to crunch those cycles that you can just out compete anybody else who's trying to do that onshore, offshore kind of approach. DJI started, in Hong Kong, having a vast ecosystem of service providers and manufacturing companies in that local ecosystem certainly helped, but I think this was the, deciding factor that then at the later stages, just, help them compound this advantage and really just, build massive distance between them and everybody else. And, they were just better at building amazing technology to a point where the difference in performance was such that nobody could compete with them. And if like we as work as a, as an FPV company, we felt that, when DJI entered the FPV space, which was incidentally just months after we launched our first product. And I like to say that this was a super scary moment. Imagine you're building an app and your app is, running on an Apple phone. And then Apple decides to, look into that space and all of a sudden that app is part of the standard Apple package. You're pretty much dead, right? So, it felt like that, big 800 pound gorilla, the DJI was entering in a tiny market, which was FPV at the time. And, they were basically able to leverage their influence and access to certain, certain parts of the hardware ecosystem in China in order to provide solutions that were simply out of reach for us. And specifically, this was like, custom built chips that did low latency video, over, over RF, and that was for any other company or almost any other company in the FPV space, that was just completely out of reach from the standpoint of existing know how, access to capital, et cetera, et cetera. So, this is basically an advanced version of what was happening back in 2014. It's just access to different aspects of, technology.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But DJI was also very aggressive in their pricing. If I recall back in 2015, with the Solo, the one that had the GoPro camera and the gimbal, that was priced around 1, 700, while the Phantom 3 Professional package was sold at the same time about 1, 300, but then, a year later, DJI brought the price down to 900 and then slashed previous year's models to as low as 500. And so that pretty much put every other company in the West out of business. And, perhaps because they saw software as an advantage or because it was out of necessity, but Western companies pivoted to software. It was very difficult to compete with that. So, yeah, I agree. It was. It was a very, bleeding edge, innovative product and culture, but it could afford to have such price cuts. And so from that perspective, how did the strategy of their vertical integration play into their ability to outprice the competition. Perhaps this is a good transition to talk about their business model of vertical integration, as opposed to what we see currently in the West and compare and contrast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's an interesting observation and, for me, when I was, looking at that, my first thought was, okay, what the hell they were thinking 3d Robotics pricing their, product at a price point that was higher than DJI, you know, fiercest competitor to begin with. And then, DJI it even went lower than the original pricing. So that, that, that was the first thing that they struck me. But I think that, this vertical integration playbook really benefited DJI at first on the logistics level and on a pricing level where they could simply afford to go down with price because they didn't have a guy that was doing all of their manufacturing that had to make their money. They were the guy. So they could just make slightly less than that. This was a luxury that Western companies could not afford. But later, this system integration really enabled them to produce systems that are simply much more performant. So it was not just the pricing power and the logistics of it, speed to innovate or the ability to slash prices and still make money. It's also if you are not just doing your own manufacturing, but also rather than system integrating components that are produced by other parties, you are actually building all those technology blocks yourself from the chip out and then, otherwise, and then from within the chip itself in, in, in this latest stage, right, that I referred to earlier, you can start to unlock all these little pockets of efficiency that sit between the black boxes that you would otherwise connect, being a system integrator. And it boils down to, in order for these subsystems to be compatible, they need to talk over certain protocols, which are designed for interoperability, not necessarily for efficiency, and they're always a compromise. And then, when you have the luxury of owning the black boxes, the two black boxes you need to integrate, then you can open them and you can tweak them and you can optimize for whatever you're optimizing for and then unlock a tiny bit of efficiency here, tiny bit of efficiency there. And when you look at across the whole system, these little efficiencies compound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Give us some specific examples of where that manifests in drone performance, because as you describe this history, something that jumps at me is how is it that this performance advantage persists nearly 10 years later? If we look in the smartphone space, for instance, 10 years after the introduction of the iPhone, the hardware from competing smartphone manufacturers was all in the same league, right? They were all competing neck and neck. Whereas there's something about robotics or about drones or about this type of system that has enabled the first player and has enabled DJI to, not just have economies of scale, but to have what you're describing as a fundamental gap in performance versus what someone else could build using best of breed components that are available out in the rest of the market. You put those components together and you try and build a performant drone. It's going to fall short, and you're going to explain, hopefully, what that looks like today, and why that is, because I think that gets to the heart of the value of this integration, and it also gets to the heart of your first observation about the conventional wisdom that has been built up over the last few decades of how and why hardware commoditizes. Why is there a wrinkle in this space that challenges that conventional wisdom and leads you to a different conclusion? Let's get down to specifics and really unpack it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the parallel with, mobile phone, industry is a great one because both in, in small unmanned and smartphones, size matters, energy consumption matters and performance matters. And specifically thermals also matter, right? One of the, one of the interesting aspects where tighter integration can lead you to better outcomes than system integration, right. So I think it's a great, it's a great comparison and, In that world, in a mobile world, we have Apple versus others, just as we have DJI versus others in the small UAS world. And it just proves the point that, system integration will get you to a point but it will not bring you to the, the position of the number one player in terms of performance, right? And we're seeing the same thing play out in the smartphone world and in the UAS world. And I'm going to give you an example where this system integration, versus vertical integration really takes you to different levels, and that would be, low latency video as a sort of, specific use for a data link in a small UAS. In low latency video, and this is something that, that, we're very intimately, connected to because this is something that we've pursued and tried to compete with DJI in the FPV world, so we know that really well. In low latency video, there are certain quite different technology blocks that you need to integrate very tightly. And and in this case, system integration, like, it goes one level deeper. It's not system integrating a radio module and a video processing module. It's basically done on the chip level. So if you're not doing your own chips, you need to get a chip that's going to do your video processing, perhaps host to radio, then you need to get your chip, which basically is your baseband chip, right? And the problem with that, and it's that level of system integration. So it's like chip, not board level, but chip level system integration. And in this particular case, neither of those chips have been designed for this particular application. if you're really doing ultra low latency stuff, as we did in the FPV world, in the consumer FPV world, our, measure of latency was in milliseconds, single digit milliseconds. So, like, we need it to be below 30 milliseconds, glass to glass. When the photon hits the sensor to when the photon emits from the display on the other end, that needs to be 30 milliseconds or less.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>22:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Just for clarity, that's important for the human pilot flying the drone to have that sense of instantaneous transparency through to what's happening with the drone. That's where any sense of delay just disappears. Is that what you're\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>23:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, to go to, to frame that further, like, flying, consumer FPV, either racing or freestyle, human is very tightly, embedded in the control loop. The drone is not stabilized in any meaningful way. You are keeping it level by throttling it more or less. So, so you really need, with your eyes, you perceive the response, dynamic response of the airframe and you're providing the control input. It's pitch and roll or it's yaw or it's throttle, which is, arguably the most sensitive part for most of the new pilots, right? Throttle control. So, with low latency video, the lower that latency is, the more tightly you can be embedded as a pilot. You can be embedded into that control, right? This is why latency is important. And, it was funny because when we were thinking about latency, low latency in the rest of the world would be below thousand milliseconds. And there we were counting single milliseconds in order to, acquire frame from the sensor, put it into memory, read it from memory, encode it, compress it, packetize, you know, again, memory write, and then again, make it into a packet, send it off to a radio, and then radio needs to be transmitted, right? So, we're counting milliseconds and, all of these chips are really made for a user experience which operates in a sub second world, half a second here or there, Great example is, encoders, decoders. Like, we're talking about SOCs that have video encoders and decoders. They are made to consume or originate media in an embedded device. Not necessarily to be super fast and super efficient at encoding video and sending it at high frame rates and counting latency in, in milliseconds. So, if you have any latency, you're gonna buffer. And, that you've problem solved. Nobody's gonna, nobody's gonna, notice. So, first of all, like, if, when you start selecting those SOCs and you start asking questions to chip vendors, okay, how fast, yeah, we have a, encoder that's capable of doing, X. Okay, how fast does it compress a frame of certain, resolution? They don't know. They don't care. They don't have that metric, So this tells you that, we're trying to use a chip for an application that was not even like an afterthought to folks. And then on the radio level, on the radio SOC level, like, if you want to be, affordable for consumer space as we want it to be, you need to go commodity and commodity in this world means, Wi Fi SOCs, 802. 11 as a standard is not optimized for that kind of latency. It's optimized and it's designed for, interoperability and coexistence. We need to have a number of 802. 11 APs and station devices that, that, need to coexist in the same space. So they, they need to be able to negotiate how they access the spectrum, and not stamp on each other. That's not what resilient, low latency, radio for unmanned applications is. It's all about, consistently and robustly being able to transmit video packets without interruption to the ground station. And again, you're trying to make that radio chip do something that it has not been designed for and all that firmware that's not been designed for. So like, you're having to make compromises. Or go off standard if you can, which you can't because, the volumes that we're doing are so small that all these chip vendors are not paying attention. So, you end up making all these compromises, which then result in a performance that's suboptimal. Whereas, if you had the full control over the entire black box that is the chip and the hardware encoder, and the black box that is the radio, piece, the 802.11 chip, you would be able to, go into that black box, tweak what you need to tweak, make the two black boxes talk to each other seamlessly and efficiently, and without losing a step. And that's how you get the performance system. And which makes the difference between DJI's video link and everybody else's video link. They had the opportunity to, go into those black boxes and access to those black boxes. Whereas rest of the world had to deal with wiring the black boxes, whether the wires are literal wires or they're traces on a PCB, it ends up being the same thing, right? That's a great example of how, being able to integrate tightly outperforms system integration.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Especially in the absence of standards that emphasize the performance qualities that your market needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Now, how do you balance developing proprietary protocols that you need to optimize the overall system, how do you balance that with the need to interoperate in, call it the modern battlefield or in a commercial ecosystem?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's also, that's a great question. I think, the higher up you are in, the, you can draw parallels with the OSI layers, higher, how much higher are in, in those layers, it's easier to be interoperable and the lower you are to the bare metal, it's hard to be interoperable. And the reason I'm saying that is, you know, maybe you will want to do hardware that's, It's gonna be compatible with the Pixhawk universe, so your hardware needs to be somewhat interoperable, in order to be compatible with, with, Autopilot stack. But then again, you also want some proprietary stuff running there. so it's really, this is one of the challenges of building a hybrid, solutions that combine your proprietary stuff to, open source stuff, if that makes sense. So this is a very tough balancing act. And again, it leads to compromises, but the thing that's, that, suffers is that full compatibility.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So given the benefits of vertical integration how do you explain that, outside of a few companies like Orqa like Skydio, like Autel, I don't know, perhaps there's some others that you would like to mention, but how come that there are relatively few companies who are pursuing this vertically integrated model?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think first of all, vertical integration in the small UAS world is super hard, and this is because there are so many constraints, space, energy, swap in general. And there's a wide variety of different technology blocks, really, very disparate technology blocks that you need to, command in order to basically be in a position to system integrate, right? So, ranging from radio on one end of the spectrum to, I don't know, propulsion on the other. Completely different problem sets, but also interrelated in how they can affect each other in a very tight and confined space, which is a small universe. So, I think that like the threshold to, to actually be able to, start system integrating is pretty high in terms of like, simply starting from the number of different teams that you need to have in order to, to get started down that path. And I think, the type of talent that's required for certain technology blocks in this group, that they could be considered exotic, from the standpoint of like the current talent pool that the West is operating on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you have any observations more broadly on this market dynamics and how it is dividing into different segments where one segment is companies that are taking off the shelf components and putting them together for custom use cases, as we will in this discussion call them system integrators versus some that are vertically integrated, and then also, a handful of others that are also vertically integrated, but also very focused on a specific mission, like Manna like Wing for instance. How do you make sense of this segmentation of the market and the dynamics playing out in the future?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I do think that there's always going to be need for system integrators. If you think of the long tail of applications, a lot of these applications in the long tail are going to be much more efficiently and perhaps effectively served by specific system integrated solutions. And this is why I do believe in a long term persistence of component ecosystem, which will serve a diverse and innovative space of system integrators that will go after these, more or less exotic or like, all of these applications in the long tail. And I'm a firm believer in that. And, there's also, this angle of like the solutions that are addressing the head of the distribution, like, your Matrice or your Mavic, they're going to be great for 95 percent of applications or 90 percent of applications. And that, they're not going to be that great for the rest 10 percent of applications, right? So, there's also that aspect of how useful is your Swiss Army knife? So, in a way, this is like going back to semicon. This is why, all those chips that we end up having to use, are not that great for some, niche applications, like, low latency video, or radio, right? So, so, this is the same, this is the same type of dynamic. So I do think that there's going to be, a vibrant ecosystem of, system integrators that are going to be served by hopefully as vibrant ecosystem of component providers. there's going to be demands for interoperability. And, you know, to counter myself, this is going to be driving towards commoditization because you don't have to have this interoperability and, commoditization there I can accept happening. But if we talk about the head of the curve and really going after these most frequent, most, numerous applications, then in this space, we're going to have fierce competition in performance between the players that are able to vertically integrate, and not only to vertically integrate their supply chains, being able to compete on the economics, but also quickly integrate their R&amp; D, being able to dig deep into those black boxes, integrate them tighter, unlock those pockets of, efficiency that will compound into a higher performance over the competition. And in the small UAS world, that means flying longer. That means, safer mission. That means easier operation, all these things that kind of, make an overall user experience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Can you give a, perspective of near term market size for the component manufacturers, for the system integrator, for the service delivery company.

This low latency video comes from this niche consumer FPV space, which is where, the pressure cooker of consumer FPV where Orqa was born. But, outside of that, at the moment, like, your typical unmanned, remote operation scenario is not that, latency sensitive. Now, the lower the latency is the more dynamic remote operation scenario you can tackle. And, I think it's like one of those things where what's possible technologically, really defines what applications can be, but for the most, remotely operated or like, and even autonomy, right, Everybody's talking about autonomy, whether it's land based or aerial. In any massively fielded autonomous system, there's always going to be a percentage of edge cases where a human operator is going to need to intervene to get the bot out of the situation. Even in, in like, ideal world of autonomy, there's always going to have to be an option to remotely operate. Remote operation is integral part of the autonomy stack because you will need that. Even five percent of edge cases creates a necessity for hundreds of thousands of hours of remote operation. And then the latency of your video is going to allow you more and more dynamic situations, if that makes sense, right? But one thing I'm going to tell you what we were pitching back when we were kind of goggle company and low latency, you know, this was, you know, 90 percent of our stack, we were pitching this kind of remote reality as opposed to virtual reality, which is a technology enabling, an operator a immersive experience of remote real world setting, in a way that would enable the dynamic interaction scenario. So you, it would actually allow you to interact with remote environment. But I think that's still in, in an SF realm, in an SF domain. no,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, in autonomous systems, as most of us have been thinking about them, and the community has been working on them, you'll have video as a sensor, but a lot of processing of that data will be done right there behind the camera, and then only a very small amount of data is transmitted anywhere based on it. In this case, it's looking at, well, if you could transmit the full video, even over an RF link, even over a long distance, and you could do it at this type of sub 30 millisecond latency, what are the implications of that? What does that enable? Whether it's a human on the other end that is consuming the video, okay, that's remote operations, we know about that. Or whether it is machines that are consuming the full video on the other end, is that a frontier that we're looking at? Does that have implications for how you coordinate massive numbers of automated systems and enable them to coordinate very closely together? Is this an enabler to that, or is this a nice to have?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I, I think you're onto something there because like, especially for smaller autonomous systems, if you can displace that power hungry, and hot running compute from a small thing that flies perhaps, then, you would need a way to, to get that, sensory input at lowest possible latency. And, it's much cheaper to run a video compression workload or video pipeline then it is to run a autonomy processing pipeline on a tiny thing that needs to be autonomous. So, so, there's certainly, displacing the compute, displacing the brain kind of thing, which is also an added, benefit to, to like having low latency.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So there have been attempts in the past for Western drone companies to displace DJI, or at least, come close to it in terms of market share, but none really achieved any meaningful, interesting success in scale.

And I think that the rest of the ecosystem, rest of the world is actually getting a second chance. And I hate to say it, it's part of the unfair advantage that us as Western drone companies have, DJI does not have access anymore to increasingly large swaths of market and applications, and this is creating a vacuum in which, you know, Western companies that are lagging behind in terms of, the performance capability of their system, that they can, try to compete amongst each other in filling that vacuum.

Yeah, well, probably, yes, they were subsidized extensively, but, we cannot hide from the fact that, they just did a marvelous job at engineering those solutions. And we have a chance to catch up, like collective West to catch up, leverage technology supremacy that we have in other fields, such as semicon.

And so we need to be able to create a Western superior product to the DJI. Who would you assemble? What would you assemble in order to be able to put something together that's better and price competitive?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I strongly believe in the possibility of the DJI of the West. I mean, this is, this is our, this is the premise that, that Orqa is building our future five, 10 years. We think that we can grow into a DJI of the West. But I'm a strong believer in DJI of the West having a strong presence both in United States and in Europe. And I believe that being able to serve those two markets, in, in full sense of the word, like being able to have customer intimacy, being able to have strong presence, and being able to, share identity. And then not, it's not just like, Orqa as European company opening offices in the States. It's also about being deeply embedded into the respective ecosystems. I do think that, strongly believe actually that, this is the way to build a DJI Out West. Have a very strong presence in both of these ecosystems on both sides of the Atlantic and, be able to, to really, serve customers on both sides of the Atlantic. And, when we talk about serving customers, there's going to have to be a, super tight integration especially if we talk about on the enterprise level, let alone defense, which is a story in and of itself, but even on the enterprise level, there's going to be, there's going to have to be a tight level of integration with all these aerial data collection devices and, how the data is being used and processed and decided upon, right. So, so, so, that requires, deep understanding of enterprises in their all specific shapes and forms on both sides of the Atlantic. Because, arguably there's a difference in how utilities operate in the States versus EU, for example, right? And then, you can look across all these other potential application areas. I'm not talking about how it's technically operating, but how they're organized, how they function and all these sorts of things. So I do think that this is like a strong advantage to a transatlantic player over any player that's going to be solely in US or solely in Europe, right? And learning from DJI Playbook, integration matters on the logistics point and pricing matters. And like, EU has done a tremendous job of reaching out to, more Eastern parts of the continent and integrating those economies and leveraging the beneficial costs environment. So, there's a good 10 to 15 years where this is going to be an advantage until we kind of level off. So there's going to be a substantial advantage of having a European, a specifically Central and Eastern European base, in being competitive on a cost level, both on R&amp;D side and the production side. So I think this is also an important factor.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Let's talk more specifically about the emergence of a credible DJI competitor. You mentioned a couple of catalysts. One being the, vacuum that's been created by the DJI ban that's been growing in, in scope and we'll see how that discussion ends, but we haven't talked about Ukraine, which is another great catalyst for the entire industrial base. In a world that looks much different than back in 2015 in terms of the maturation of the industry, the components, the supply chain, will the winning playbook be the DJI playbook, or will the maturation of the market and the technologies needed to put together a system like that, will that create an opening for another playbook?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think that, Ukraine and War in Ukraine is a massive, contributor to this, to this dynamic in unmanned, especially aerial system, small UAS and if you think about it, it's a perfect storm. On one hand, like you have these large swaths of market that are not accessible to DJI, primarily in the defense and security sector, primarily defense, and then later leaked out onto the law enforcements and security and critical infrastructure, et cetera. And then on top of that, you have this profound revolution in how defense thinks about UAS combined and, reinforced, right? So, so, before Ukrainian war, defense thought about UAS in terms of fixed wing systems, predominantly half a million, thereabout price point operated on a relatively high echelon of command. And what Ukraine is proving very graphically today is that the bulk of utility of unmanned actually comes from small UAS copters, multi copters, operated on the lowest echelon of command and deployed in massive numbers. And then, if you combine that, like massive need for small copters in the defense sector, and then, defense sector itself being sterile of DJI, like, this is like a complete no go zone, like, maybe there's a gray area in law enforcement, arguably, law enforcement agencies still could use DJI in Europe, but in defense, no way. Right. So the defense is like completely free of DJI competition for all of us other companies. So, these two dynamics are creating a perfect storm for a step up, massive step up in demand for the types of solutions that, would be provided by would-be DJI competitors and providing this initial momentum that will drive the, innovative cycle. So I think, even without the Ukrainian war, this dynamic and this kind of DJI West playbook became viable. The Ukrainian war just cranked it up to 11, really.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So fair to assume that a number of companies will come in and rush to get into and fill that vacuum. How do you expect the competitive dynamics to evolve on each of the segments? Let's look at, the consumer, the defense, the enterprise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So for consumer, I think, we have to look at different segments of consumer. There's like a, retail, consumer, market, which is, basically still, open for competition and DJI is untouchable there simply in terms of performance, the price, pricing power, it's the obvious choice for the consumer. Now, if we talk about educational segment of consumer type products, that's a different story because again, especially in US, this is also an area where Western companies have this unfair advantage that we can leverage in order to get business, be able to reinvest in R&amp; D and provide solutions that are going to be fully Western made. So, there's these two different sectors. And we as a company, we're looking at educational space where we can provide fully Western made solutions. And then we look at really some niches where we can compete on a purely technological and pricing basis. Now, enterprise is still, I believe, somewhat contested, although I've heard examples where, companies are really reluctant to go for DJI or Chinese solutions. So, this gives an unfair advantage to, to, Western companies. I think this is going to be contested, and it's going to be harder to compete with solutions that are not, as performant as DJI, however you want to measure performance. But I do think that, as opposed to consumer, you will still be able to sell a good enough solution. You know, you don't need to be better, you just need to be good enough to be able to sell. And there's like a large portions of that enterprise market where this is going to be the case. And then defense is, defense is purely like, it's going to be, and it's not going to be, it is right now the space where we're going to see most of, the business, happening for Western drone companies, in the small UAS or multicopter space, which is typically dominated by DJI. I'm not talking about Fixed Wing type platforms. We have a lot of great companies operating in that space across the board, talking about really small copters.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What are the major cost drivers for developing a small UAS system? What we hear is that for performance that is, somewhat approaching DJI's performance, you can get that from a Western drone OEM for three, four, five times the price, depending on, on, the specific use cases, et cetera. Can you generalize the major cost drivers and how certain catalytic forces like the Ukrainian war and the broadening of the industrial base, how that might impact those prices?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think volume is the dominant one. I don't think that prior to Ukraine, there was a conceivable scenario where a Western drone company would be in a position to sell a lot of copters to government users. Now with Ukraine happening, what we're seeing is a lot of, Western defense, end users are waking up to the fact that copters are going to be needed and copters are going to be needed in large volumes and copters are going to be used in an attritable manner. You deploy them and you're going to expect to lose them within three missions. So you better stock up on them. And not just that, you better invest in a capability, churn them out in large numbers, should you need them. Now this is a major contributor to, to really willingness to buy, willingness to invest in this capability, and like in the capability to, to develop these technologies, right, and support, Western companies and giving them business and contracts, et cetera. So I think volume is the main, you know, this understanding that, small UAS, small copters, that's, if you look at Ukraine, like this is all Mavic and Autels are the workhorses of the battlefield on both sides. And we as a collective West do not have a solution that's comparable to either.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You've been an early and leading player in the FPV segment, which now has emerged, or has grown from a very niche to volumes that dwarf any other segment. So can you talk about how you've experienced this evolution and kind of the trends that you're seeing and how you see the future?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's interesting because, before the war, we, had all these different strategies on how to popularize FPV because, you had to explain to people what FPV is. And for very unfortunate reasons, FPV has arguably become a household word now. And, you know, how that plays out, and I'm talking as a company that, that was started as a hobby company, consumer company, how that plays out and how FPV is perceived after the war, you know, it's anybody's guess. And I'm not entirely comfortable as FPV enthusiast, I'm not entirely comfortable with that situation. I don't know whether FPV is going to exist after the war, or, will we be able to fly FPV as civilians after the war. So I'm not entirely comfortable with that. But what Ukraine started is like, it showed how effective, consumer grade technology can be in a modern war. And that's the, I think the most impactful part of the whole dynamic that, that developed because, what's being used in Ukraine is essentially a hobby grade, technology that's incredibly accessible from the cost perspective, from the technological perspective, you need a bit of skills to build, and quite a lot of skill to operate, this type of vehicle, but nevertheless, super accessible. Like I cannot be expected to build a Javelin myself in my garage, but I can build an FPV in my garage. And with an FPV, I can probably hit a tank at a greater distance than I can with a Javelin. And I can bill it for like, what, 300, 500? And, Javelin is what, hundreds of thousands? So, this gives you an idea of how much disruption happened\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Can you just describe first person view? What is it? What's its value? What happens if somebody doesn't have an FPV capability for those who may not know as much about the market?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So FPV stands for First Person View. It's what we used to call our hobby prior to the war. FPV today stands for a first person view, manually controlled, quad captor. That is a radio controlled, a drone that's capable of carrying an explosive payload and it's operated fully manually, like as you would a race drone, by a skilled operator. And, this is basically, you can fly a drone for, a couple of kilometers and you can, strike an armored vehicle, which costs in millions with an asset that's, you know, the, some people call it an, like a flying IED that, that costs like hundreds of bucks, to build. And, we've seen a lot of companies coming up, in that space, being a component provider, we could see a lot of Western companies coming into that space, but in reality, Ukrainian war in particular, although that created a lot of interest in the West and that, created a lot of companies that are looking in that space, realistically, this again, was dominated by Chinese companies who were well placed, to serve both the needs of Ukraine and Russia in providing either components or build systems. And I think, if you look at, how various Western companies performed and Orqa included, trying to compete in that space, like again, we collectively couldn't compete with the Chinese on, on, on prices. And I don't think we should, because longterm, I think that FPV is specific to Ukraine and it's a phenomenon that's, indicative of absence of other means of strike by both sides, and, whether, strapping an explosive ordnance to a copter, whether that's going to be a optimal way to do precision strikes, that's anybody's guess. And my guess is, you know, probably there are more optimal ways to perform strikes, kinetic strikes. But what I'm certain of is that copters are the optimal way to provide battlefield transparency, the type of which we're seeing in Ukraine right now. And, as much as I don't think that the FPVs as a strike capability are going to stay here post Ukraine, I'm 100 percent certain that copters, which may or may not be FPV and arguably don't need to be FPV, will persist as a principle way to provide situational awareness and battlefield transparency, in the future. I'm not saying that the fixing platforms are going to be done, but I'm saying that, we're still going to have these fixing platforms operated on a higher echelons, but we're going to see much more copters being operated on a very low command levels. The challenge is going to be really collecting all of the data and then processing it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What have you observed in terms of how FPVs are being employed in Ukraine? How has it changed since early 2023 to today? What do you see coming in the future, and what is it about that that makes you think that FPVs are perhaps unique to the Ukraine conflict and that they're not going to continue to evolve in this way for future conflicts that they'll be supplanted by something else. I think that there are people out there with, the assumption that this evolution, what we're seeing in Ukraine is going to continue and that Western militaries across the spectrum are going to be rearming with, massive numbers of FPVs and incorporating these into their tactics as a lesson from the war. But if you have a different view on how that's going to look, walk us through that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Oh, yeah. I think, if, if you wanna have the nitty gritty realities of use of FPV in Ukraine, I strongly advise, listening to War on The Rocks, podcast and Russian Contingency where, Rob Lee and Mike Kaufman are really, delivering direct from the battlefield experience of FPV operators. And this is very detailed and highly informative in terms of tactics. So, what we're observing, is basically there's, some cat and mouse development in terms of electronic warfare countermeasures and being able to deploy these systems, freely, so there's a big change between, what was working at the early stages of war to what's working now. We're seeing a lot of, evolution in terms of how the electronic warfare measures are deployed and how the, systems are evolving to, be able to, operate in the presence of, electronic warfare. So there's that. These FPV systems are being, operated in an increasingly larger numbers. And basically both sides have been very successful in adopting those and evolving the tactics of their use. But ultimately I think, again, this is a specific for Ukraine because, simply because barring, drones, FPV drones and drones in general, and the anti air systems this is a very low tech war, ultimately. And, these FPV systems are being applied in a, a bolt on manner. And whether I'm seeing FPVs that are being used in Ukraine right now being used by, uh, in this form by Western NATO member countries, I would say no. Just starting from the fact that once you power up the drone, you're broadcasting unencrypted video feed to whoever cares to tune in. Like, just start from that. And, this goes from the fact that because of the latency, and because of the EW resiliency, you're compelled to operate an analog video system, and there's no efficient way to encrypt or scramble analog video system, just that, that leaves you with having to broadcast your mission, to whoever wants to tune in in the vicinity. So, so there's that. Also, like, I don't think that we should be falling into a trap of thinking that these are super efficient systems simply by looking at social media. And this is one thing that, that really, repeated by the people who had the chance to really observe how these systems are being employed. Like the efficiency numbers are super, super low. because. If we look on the social media, we're just seeing the strikes, but, then there's a massive, positive selection, happening there, right? So you will not see unsuccessful strikes being posted on Twitter and, you know, all the FPV pilots, from before the war, they know that, whenever you fly, you turn on the DVR because, if you lose a drone, that's how you find it by looking at the DVR footage. You can imagine that if every FPV mission is filmed and the operator has the footage, then you could even, say that we have seen every successful strike that happened, right? And we can be fairly certain that most of the successful strikes have been actually recorded. And in the world of social media and viral dynamics, this creates a powerful echo chamber where we all think that this FPV is this super efficient new asset, which, you know, we really have no grounds on making that conclusion because we don't know how many unsuccessful ones there have been for every successful one that we see. So, this second piece is efficiency. Third piece is, FPVs are really hard to operate. It takes a lot of skill, and this was one of the barriers to entry to the hobby before the war, which we were facing as a consumer company, like it's really hard to get people to remain and then to persist in the hobby long enough so they can enjoy it. Like, you really need to struggle before you get the skill and you can actually enjoy flying because it's not that easy. And I have hard time imagining, FPV being deployed in a big army sense. I can totally imagine it being deployed in a highly specialized manner. So, I can totally imagine FPV being a part of a special operator's toolkit, like that skill set, right? So, you train for a sufficient time, you become a great pilot. And then this gives you almost superpowers, right? And then arguably this can be a, a Special Ops thing rather than a big Army thing. Then again, simply the logistics of, deploying large number of FPVs is a stretch to be, you know, diplomatic. I mean, I'm going to give you an example. Whenever we would go out and fly for fun, there was always problems with frequencies and 5. 8 band, which is where you, where your video operates is very narrow. So you effectively have eight channels. And if you go out with a group of friends, like five or six of you, it's a logistic nightmare to make everybody stick to their own frequency. Right, so you always have this situation you're flying and somebody plugs in and they're on your frequency so all of a sudden you can't see anything. So trying to extrapolate that experience to a chaos of war where there's not only your side trying to deploy these missions en masse. There's adversaries trying to deploy these missions, like it's a nightmare. it adds to that thing about how efficient it really is, this question. So, compounding these five, different aspects of, like, reality of FPV I don't think it being used massively for strike. What I am, again, I'm going to say it, what I'm seeing this Ukrainian war changing in a way, how, army uses, copters is this situational awareness, mass deployed, highly attritable platforms for, defense applications. And, as an FPV company, we get a lot of, oh, FPV is the big in Ukraine. you guys, must be selling hundreds of thousands. And I'm like, no, the only ones making money in this FPV space in Ukraine are Chinese companies that, that perhaps they were making ready to fly drones in maybe single digit thousands per batch. I can totally imagine a lot of these companies doing tens of thousands per month, easy. And that led, funnily enough, that led to the commoditization. the price per system is like 500 bucks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Isn't there an argument though that technology will continue to innovate and try to close some of the gaps that you were talking about, whether this is better use of the RF spectrum, better, digital data links that are also resilient to EW, better logistics, better deployments, better ways for humans and machines to interface. Isn't that a valid argument that this arc of technology evolution will continue and make FPVs relevant in the future? Or if not, how do you see that arc continuing to evolve?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and I would add increasing automation of the flight control itself. All of those things, what would you want to see in terms of changes across that spectrum of technologies that would change your conclusions?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, I think, one of the gaps, certainly is, spectrum management. It's also EW resiliency for the high throughput data links, and video arguably is a high throughput data link. It's very hard to sustain sufficient data throughput over an RF data link for digital video. If you think that even 10 percent package loss of a compressed video is total, video loss. That's, super hard to sustain even in a congested RF environment, let alone contested RF environment. So, so, that, that's going to have to change in order for, these systems to be viable and a prerequisite for like, I think wider adoption, FPVs is going to have to be moving away from freely broadcasted analog video, which all of the FPVs you're using both in defense and in the hobby are being used, are using right now. I can totally see a benefit in adding automation and autonomy to these systems. It's gonna reduce the barrier to entry for skill required to operate. It would not have to be a matter of dexterity and ability to, to really, fly and, skill it's gonna, it's gonna be learned and it's gonna, you'll be able to learn more efficiently. But also, and I'm going back to this point of whether copters are the right strike vehicle. And that's always this thing that I'm coming back to. And I know that this trope of swarm of drones is a very attractive one, but have you ever seen how drone light shows are being deployed? It takes a stadium to set them up. So you're literally setting up an acre of drones almost in order to deploy a light show. So this trope of having swarms of drones attacking, like you would be, you, there, there's a lot of logistics that needs to go in, in deploying a large number of drones. And if one thing that we've learned about this war is that in a transparent battlefield, you need to reduce your logistic footprint, not, so, so in, in a way, we're going to have to, innovate, like collective we, we're going to have to innovate heavily in order to come up with a smaller footprint for deployment swarms, if we want to make swarms a thing. And then it brings me to the question, is copter really a great platform for strike? Or are there more, like, compact, efficient platforms to deploy strikes at that distance with that type of payload. And again, I have to go back to saying, expressing an opinion that, I think that both Ukraine and Russia are using FPVs as a matter of necessity and accessibility. It's more of an accessibility thing, because all you need is 500 bucks of Chinese components, some carbon, and explosives, to be able to affect a, precision strike beyond line of sight. And that's it. and, couple that with virality of the footage that, we established is recorded for every mission by default, because this is what you do as an FPV pilot, you DVR everything. Like, when you add that two things together, like, you get this impression that, oh, it's a massive thing, whereas, reality might be completely different. But what we are seeing is, a lot of Western forces are, working to, acquire these capabilities to, learn how to deploy them, learn how to use them, learn how to defend against them. And I think this is going to be here to stay, but I think that, this is a starting point and it will necessarily evolve and what's the end state, the, final form of it. Anybody's guess. And I'm really not. even, arguably being an insider and understanding, this, deeply because, we were doing it before it was cool. I wouldn't dare to venture where it lands, like, what's going to be the final shape of the strike vehicle, and I'm not sure it's going to be a copter. On the contrary, I'm kind of willing to place a bet that it's not going to be. Where I'm willing, again, 100 percent to place a bet is like for, low level ISR situational awareness, there's hardly a better thing than a copter.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Srdjan what's the message that you'd like the audience to take away from this discussion?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, two messages, like, first of all, building small things that fly, it's super hard. And people should be aware that, although there is a massive, advantage of vertical integration versus system integration, we should not underestimate system integration because that in itself is also super hard to do right. So I think, ultimately if there's like one or two things, this would be that, this is hard, this is very hard. And, people that are doing this right now, are really, the barrier to entry is quite high.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Excellent.

So I was really looking forward to this conversation with Don. Because as he says, weather imposes uncertainty, and uncertainty costs money. We've known for years, the cost of weather on traditional aviation. And listen up to the kinds of numbers that Don shares as those costs and what percentage of those costs are considered preventable. This discussion is essentially about what's possible in weather. Don says that aviation has gotten used to the lack of weather data and it's gotten used to uncertainty and that there are ways to improve weather today and in the future. Improvements that could dramatically improve flight operations and reduced costs, according to Don. Listen to what a weather pro says about the three things most needed for a better forecast. And according to Don, how data is key to improvement. We get into a discussion of weather on smaller things that fly. Drones and eVTOLs and other vehicles in advanced air mobility. Now Don talks about the need for better low altitude and micro weather and the need for better data for micro weather. He says that with drones, there's approximately a 40 to 50% attrition rate due to weather. But here's the challenge. Even though everyone says they need better systems in this case, better weather systems how much are they really willing to pay for those systems? This is one of the great challenges of selling technology to aviation. And Luka and Peter really challenged Don here. They know advanced air mobility is really thin profit and margins. And questioned their willingness to pay for better weather. But as Don counters though, they can't afford not to have better weather. So take it all in and many thanks to Don for joining us and to our many guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Don Berchoff as you innovate and The Vertical Space.

I think it's just a lack of understanding about, you know, what's possible with weather. And, so I, you know, when you asked me that question, I think of two industries. I think of my weather industry, which is, my home. And then I think of the, aviation industry, which is who we support and who I'm part of. The weather industry, I think, is in agreement with most of what we're going to talk about today, that there's a lack of low altitude weather data, that impacts predictions and that impacts uncertainty. I don't think anyone would argue with that. We might argue with how to close that gap and what's the right way to do it, but I think most people understand that gap. On the aviation side, the challenge that I've run into is most of your aviation folks who have been out there operating for lots of years have really gotten used to the lack of weather data. And they've kind of built it into their mindset or into their business model. So they're used to flying and dealing with the weather and overcoming uncertainty. And they really, sometimes they looked at me five years ago when I first entered this industry. And I said, this is going to be a challenge that for drones and air taxis, the lack of low altitude weather. And, they said, well, why are you trying to? You know, solve a problem that doesn't exist. That was actually quotes. And you know, it actually did exist, but they were used to it and they didn't understand what was possible. What I'm starting to see now is as folks are flying more in the industry, they're realizing, you know what, we're starting to see and understand the economics around weather data more than the safety component. You can always get around weather by not flying. And, we, we generally had about a 30%. of the time when manned aviation or crewed aviation didn't fly due to weather. They could have flown, but they didn't think of it that way. And so that's really where the mystery is going to get unlocked here. We're going to show them that you can, make more money with better weather data. We're going to show them you can reduce your risk. We can reduce your uncertainty. We can increase your passenger comfort. And you don't have to live with what you had because technology is changing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, why is there the difference between those who know weather and the aviation communities interface with weather? Why is there a difference?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's a really good question. so I'm going to bifurcate the weather industry a little bit for you. You have those that are scientists folks that are actually in the business of producing forecasts. And they really do understand the things we're talking about. You need more data to make a better forecast. That sounds like common sense, right? But it really isn't as obvious to everyone as you might think even in the weather industry, because we have, the business side of weather. And the business side of weather, came out of really the 1980s and 90s. You know, the government had been the monopoly in weather and it had to be. There was really no options. And what weather companies did initially is they would take that government data and they customize it or make it much more impactful to a decision. In the beginning we didn't really change the forecast. Other than the human would look at the data and have this interpretive skill and heuristics that they can make it better. And that was the customized weather. People paid for that because it was better than the forecast. But then we started adding more data, right? We started getting satellites up there that were commercial satellites. We've added more weather instruments that are, privatized. we have more commercial data. but the business model has always been, and still is, focused on taking data, through apps and advertising, right? So advertisement, I always consider in the weather industry, we have a conflict of interest. The conflict of interest is, if you're in the business of providing data on apps and you're selling advertising, you have a motivation to have people click your apps more, which means now you want to, make data more hyper exciting, right? And then you have the customized piece, which isn't scalable unless you change the technology, around it, which is what TrueWeather's doing. And we have folks that like the current business model. And they don't want to admit that there's a lack of data, because if they do, it says we have to change the business model, which would disrupt the weather business models that depend on apps and button clicks and just forecast or customize data. So there's that middle piece there. So I'm bifurcating, a little bit. Now aviation, I think the challenge is weather's very complex. And, you know, when I was in the Air Force, I was on Air Force bases with F 16 pilots trapped at Kunsan, they didn't want to hear about my excuses about weather. They just want to know why weren't you right? Right. And, there's a tendency to try to simplify this whole process so they can make a decision that they feel comfortable with. And I think, you know, when you start explaining that you could do more with this data or that data, what I've seen in the industry is that they worry about having to pay for the data now. See, they like free data and the problem is free data is not free because it costs money. So to go back to, the edict here, in 1998, the cost of, weather delays by major airlines on the U. S. economy was 41 billion a year. And this is lost productivity, this is, decisions that cost money, it's inconvenience to customers and clients, that number is much bigger today. And to try to explain to the aviation community that's been built in the current system that there's an economic argument to be made, they don't really see it because they're not worried about the bottom line as much as the CFO is of a company.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The cost of weather delays, the 40 odd billion per year, how much of that is due to low altitude weather?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This study I'm talking about was a 1998 Boeing study that said that they actually said the 41 billion dollars was the cost of weather on the U. S. economy due to delays by the aviation industry. This is what got my attention, they said 28 billion was avoidable. That was the, that's what got me interested in this problem. Because that told me that even back then it was the way decisions were being made that was also causing some of this uncertainty that led to, you know, this 28 billion. So now if you look at today and based on what I've learned through my work in the Air Force and studies that I've done that have been validated, 30%, roughly 30 percent of, I, I think is recoverable, and the percentage of that due to low altitude weather, you have to bifurcate it down now and say, okay, that's general aviation, because remember, big aircraft don't fly at low altitude, right? They come into airports, they're well instrumented. So you gotta look at this and say, who's impacted by it? It's helicopter pilots, it's general aviations, and now it's gonna be drones and air taxis. And what I'm seeing right now based on, I can't really talk about specifics, but we're getting about a 40-50 percent weather attrition rate, meaning cancellation rate right now for some low altitude operations that are happening with drones. And my estimate is about half of that is due to lack of low altitude weather. And about half of that's due to just decision systems that aren't able to take this data and present it in ways that help to make a better decision, right? I don't want to get into those details, but that's about the way I see it right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'd love to uncover a little bit more of this because it's intriguing your comment about how there is perhaps still pushback from the aviation side that, solving for this low altitude weather is, not really worth the effort, right? Yet the impact is monetizable, some of the studies that you quote. And so is that because really where the money is, the weather is not as big of a factor on the low level, But the majority of the impact then becomes on GA and yet this is an area right now where the cost of not flying is not as high, because if you're a GA pilot, you look out the window and you decide that you won't fly because of weather and it's not like there is an economic impact as a result of it for the most part, right? So can we maybe dissect this business problem a little bit more with some examples and some additional feedback and commentary that you're hearing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. So, let's take the helicopters, for example, right? If you talk to Rex Alexander, who is a significant advocate within the helicopter community, who also is trying to work with, you know, Oh, good. So, yeah, so Rex and I, you know, we have these conversations all the time. He's worked very hard to increase the ability of the, emergency helicopter HEMS, right, Helicopter Emergency Management Services, to improve their, readiness and their ability to respond, and do that in a way to try to improve weather information through a system that has been developed by, I think, NCAR and the National Weather Service have developed a system by which they try to better pull together the data we do have and try to better inform whether a helicopter should take a mission or not. Because remember, if there's an accident on a highway and you know, you have to decide whether you're going to send an airlift out there or you're going to bring an ambulance out there what you want to make sure is that if you're going to send that helicopter, it could get to where it has to go. And many times they will not take a mission because, remember, most flying helicopters does not occur at an airport. The airport's the only place that we measure weather right now. You don't get the measurements between airports. People don't understand, like, cloud height, visibility, measurements only happen at airports. That means 97 percent of the country, you have no measurements. There's no measurements. Satellite can't do it. There's nothing. Same with winds. Winds only get measured at airports when aircraft land, or with two balloon launches a day. We have a vast, desert of data below 5, 000 feet. The satellites get down to about 5, 000 and then they attenuate. There's some that get through, but it's not really relevant. This micro weather problem is the problem. We have always known it is a problem. There was a study done from the ground up. This was developed in 2008 by the National Academies that said we needed 400 profilers around the country to measure what we call the boundary layer up to 5, 000 feet on a regular basis, right, to get this sensor data so we can improve our modeling. So the helicopters may have to go to a hospital somewhere in the middle of an urban canyon that doesn't have even, it only has a windsock. There's no digital information and if there's fog or stratus they have to fly VFR. You just don't know if you can do it because we don't have data. So they'll drop that mission. They'll say, we can't take it and it could risk a life. And so they send an ambulance out. So that's an example of just one use case, but that magnifies itself across the board, right? Into both public safety, emergency response, and business, because we haven't talked about the business side yet of not flying that helicopter to the helicopter company or the hospital. That's just an example.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What other industry is more dependent on good weather than aviation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a really good question. I would say it depends on how you define good weather, right? If you're a farmer, you want rain. That's good weather, right? If you're a renewable energy farm, you want winds. That's good weather, right? But it may not be good for your picnic. So, I always say it's the use case that drives that question. Now, you're talking about a really nice day where that's probably tourism, Because, you know, people want to go to the beach.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How about the ability to predict weather accurately, whether it be good or bad? What industry is more dependent on that, or is more affected by it? You just said there's a 40 billion study on cost and delays and cancellations. That's a significant cost to the industry. What other industry is more affected?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I'm gonna blow your mind now. In 2017, the cost of weather on the US economy was 634 billion a year. And that covers agriculture, renewable energy, construction, logistics, transportation. These are all industries that are affected by weather, and they all need micro weather, by the way. But the challenge has been is we haven't been able to build the business case to close these gaps, to collect that micro weather, because these industries, there's no real coalition. The other problem is the government can't afford to put that out, that infrastructure. I was a science and technology director at the weather service for four years. I had a 130 million budget, and I learned pretty quickly that the money that we're spending on infrastructure in the government has to be on strategic infrastructure, such as satellites and things of that sort. And we have gotten much better at long range forecasting because of satellites. But when it gets to the microweather, we haven't really invested in that. And so that's like the nearest target, but yet the hardest to solve because of the resources. So if you think about it, agriculture can use microweather, renewable energy, right? They want if, you know, every time winds are off by one or two knots from the forecast, the renewable energy farm could be hit with millions and millions of dollars because they think they're going to generate a certain amount of power. They've got a contract to generate that power, and they may have to go to the spot market now to buy fossil fuels to make up for the difference they're losing. And that costs them lots of money.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Don, this deficiency microweather out weather that you talk about is it really a statement that we need more weather observations, in order to have a better picture of micro weather or do we have enough input data and the answer is somewhere else in this chain?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you talk to folks that are trying to demonstrate that they are developing a micro weather forecast because it is a requirement, and people do need it. They're using techniques that downscale models, but not adding new data below 5, 000 feet. Just so you understand, the global models are like 9km resolution right now. That's the best. That's European. It means that every grid space is 9x9km, which means everything in that grid space looks the same. You're not resolving anything in that other than the average. Our short range models in the United States are three kilometer resolution, which is probably like a mile and three quarters or two miles. Those are in those grids you're not resolving anything below that. So if you try to continue to drive that resolution higher by getting down to one kilometer by one kilometer or 500 meters, you're not adding new data into the set. you're just, all you're doing is you're making it look better. You're making the pictures look really better, but it doesn't mean the data is accurate. You need real data just like anything else. You have to have data in order to do improvements to forecasts. There's also modeling. The modeling has to get better. There's physics and then the computing. So the three things that make a better forecast are data, computing, because you need speed. If you want to, if you do have the data and you want to run a one or half kilometer resolution model, it's going to take you computing resources, and that costs money and time, so you always have to worry, too, about turning these out fast enough. What good is a forecast if it comes out after the event. And the third one is the science. I mean, we're not, there's a reason why we can't forecast tornadoes perfectly, and there's still a lot of science. There's still a lot of things to learn. Even in icing, we have a lot of mysteries. So it's those three, but data is the key to improvement. You can't do machine learning without data. What I'm seeing in the industry is people are doing machine learning, but they're using analysis data. So the way we do historical weather in the weather community we don't have data everywhere, so you have to build a grid. You have to take the data you have, and then you build a grid, and you match that up against your physical models, and then you estimate what you think is happening in between those, and then you get a grid of historical data. But guess what? That's not real data. And people are using that kind of historical grid today, which is 15 kilometers or more resolution to run machine learning. And after they run the machine learning, they can't even validate it's right because there's no data. So, you know, that's the dirty secret in weather. Now, there are machine learning techniques that make sense, that you can do, like if you have weather radar, that you at least have real data, right? You're getting data. Although, keep in mind, weather radar is not necessarily always what it seems. Because you can have, areas that the radar beam goes above the precip, and it may be precipitating, and you're not going to see it on the radar. Right? So these are the, this is all the problems with weather instrumentation. There's no perfect solution with instruments. You have to build a village of sensors. Satellite, radar, lidar, remote sensing, you know, that kind of thing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So two questions. One, is is there a well executed accuracy assessment in the weather industry to track these various forecasts against what actually happened, so that we have an objective understanding of, okay, you have these large grids, we don't have differentiation inside, people are doing interpolation, they're training models off of those interpolations rather than off of actual observed data. But who's measuring how accurate that actually is and do we even have agreement on that, within the sector, within the industry, whatever you want to call it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, the, global models are being actively validated by the MET services. So ECMWF, National Weather Service, they are validating their models. The usefulness of that depends on what you're trying to measure. So, if you're trying to understand how accurate your winds are at 20, 000 feet, you're going to use a combination of satellite observation, and, balloon launches and maybe aircraft observations. And you, again, you're gonna map that out and potentially put it in a grid again. And you may not have a perfect real historical data set, but you have what's the best you can have. That would be on the average how you would, validate a model, using an analysis of the best data you can have and fitting it to a grid. Now, if you're talking about an airport, and you're just interested in validating your forecast at an airport for ceiling height, that's the best example of a really good validation, right? You can say, okay, I have measurements of ceiling. They come in every hour or more often. I can take a grid point out of my model and I can say, what's the ceiling forecast, what's the visibility forecast, the temperature for at that location. And that would be, that's your best set of data to do validation. So the problem is in between. So you have a point, and then you have an area. When you start looking at area, then it becomes more difficult to put a lot of confidence in all your validation. And so what TruWeather's doing, so, you know, just to give you an example, the low altitude has no validation except at a ground level at the airport. And that to me doesn't matter because drones don't fly at airports. And eVTOLs and air taxis mostly won't be flying at airports. They'll be flying out of urban centers that we have no data today. We don't know what the winds are doing in the urban canyons. We have no validation of that. All we could do is run models of what we think is happening. And they're not very good because there are a lot of estimates going into them. So, what we're doing is saying, look, we can't solve world hunger, but, when I saw the drone and air taxi industry coming up in 2017, I said, this is the best business model we've ever had for microweather. Now, you might say, well, what about agriculture, what about, yeah, they're all important. But when I say business model, I meant the ubiquitous nature, the amount of traffic that's going to be flying in certain areas. And the ability to amortize that cost of better services across a much larger array of companies and use cases. And so, my thesis has been and still is that we fill these low altitude weather gaps with ground based infrastructure and with drones that can collect weather data. And we use the satellites and we use the radar and we bring that together around corridors that are going to be your highest use corridors. Let's focus on that. We get real data now. When we run our models, we can validate that data, and we can then do real machine learning. That's the thesis.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You've painted a picture of the weather gaps that I was not aware of. I did not realize it was all generally around the airports. And, but I want to go back to, before we get to the microweather, talk about the use case, talk about the gap that you're filling. I just want to pull it right back just a little bit to commercial aviation. You mentioned the 40 billion dollars in delays, diversions, and cancellations due to weather, you're saying, and you're saying a large portion of that is preventable. So let's eat into that a little bit. You were part of the NextGen weather ConOps. What could we do today to put a dent? If you're saying a large percent of that is preventable. What could we do today to be able to help address those preventable weather delays? How could better weather, better predictions, more accurate predictions help? And how do we do it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, it's a very good question. I was involved in the JPDO back in 2005 for NextGen. I helped write the weather ConOps I had my, you know, we worked with a couple of folks. We had a vision that, you know, we would have to run more modeling, collect more data, improve the microweather. Cause keep in mind, even around, even at an airport, you're going to have microweather challenges, right? If you've ever been to San Francisco, you know about the fog that sometimes really messes up Air New Zealand coming in. And the challenge is that, you've got to improve the micro weather for the current aviation to help with that understanding of how airport delays are going to impact the system. Now, when Boeing said, because it wasn't me, 28 billion was recoverable, I mean, obviously that's a perfect system, right? We built this, NextGen weather. We couldn't get DOT and NOAA to agree who was going to pay for it. That's how simple this problem was, right? You try to go back to OMB, and I have all this experience in government, so, you go, we went to OMB, we said, look, we need to make this a, interagency kind of thing. I'm going to be frank, DOC, Department of Commerce, they've got their budget. And, NOAA has their budget. And Weather Service has their budget. And, in order to improve and get to what is really required, requires big investments in computing, big investments in other things. We couldn't even get them to agree who's going to pay for it. So that's the first challenge is just the bureaucracy. Then you have the challenge of the current systems that operators are using, we're using a lot of legacy systems in aviation that, NextGen ran into this problem, right? They said, we, you want us to equip our aircraft and do what and pay for what, and then we have to change our software. So the problem is, I made a decision that problem is intractable, right? Let's go after the low hanging fruit. Let's go after a new industry. I think the only way you're going to get to what you asked me, is by demonstrating it. And showing people how bad it really, I mean, how much it's really, costing you and then demonstrating there is a solution, right? And so then I started working with the ASTM. We rewrote the FAA to their credit, said, yes, we got to change the way weather data is collected. We've got to open up the spigot. We can't just collect data at airports anymore and say, that's the only approved data. We rewrote the standard. We got it through. It's published. FAA is working with us right now on how we can test and demonstrate that. Which means then we'll be able to get more data collected through IoT and other things as long as they follow certain rules, right? So that was always my thesis. I gave up on the big picture, right? I said, let's focus on what we can control. Helicopters have always been the bastard childs of weather. So I always knew they would be a fan. And this is where it's going. So that's kind of my answer. I know it's not a great answer, but I'm telling you exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Who's most benefited from low level weather and who really is not being affected at all.

What I was trying to get at is that you can take a lot more weather on an aircraft that's engineered, it's heavy, it's big, it can carry regular fuel, not battery power. You can put more gas on it. You have a pilot who can deal with, unexpected circumstances that will come up because we don't forecast perfectly. And you have a pilot who has flown routes that they know the local weather effects better than the weather people because you don't have the data and they never come back and tell us what they experience because they want to have that as a secret so they can get us later when they say, Oh, I told you it would be that way. I'm kidding. But, the bottom line is that you cannot scale this industry if you don't have better digital information, because that pilot today might be sitting a thousand miles away from where they're flying their drones. They want to fly one too many. There's no way the pilots can even know what's going on. They don't even wake up in the same environment that they're flying in. All those heuristics are gone. I'm sorry to say, Mr. Pilot, it's useless. Because now you're flying somewhere where you've never flown before, you've never experienced the weather, you don't even wake up in the same location that you're flying you're weather blind. And if we don't backfill that information with real data, you're going to have more uncertainty and you're going to be cancelling missions more than you have to. And you cancel them today when you could fly. 30 percent of the time when you cancel a weather, a mission due to weather, you could fly. I know you know that because you always get mad at us when we say you can't fly and then you go, I could have flown today. That's money. And that happens in manned aviation. Imagine uncrewed. Imagine lighter aircraft. Imagine a consumed data source. I mean a conserved data, a power source. You can't add more power on a battery. So now you have to make decisions. How far am I going to go? How much weight can I carry? How much recharge time do I have? And if you're flying people, how bumpy is it going to be? Now this is a totally different environment. So that gets back to your original question. What is it that many few people agree with you, Don? They disagree with me about what I'm saying because they can't see the alternative reality that's going to occur in five years. Every knot of wind is going to be battery power, just like the renewable energy. It means weight, it means distance, it means something. And, that's the bottom line. I mean, I don't see it any other way because I'm so deep in it and I know it, you know, I could see the future on this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The tendency to cancel due to weather, being, too conservative today. I totally agree with you. I was frustrated with that when I was flying. But at the same time, the cost of traditional manned aviation missions, especially in military is much higher, right? And there's human lives that you're putting at risk. And so there's a tendency to err on the side of safety. But when you're dealing with drones, whose flights are really short to begin with, who don't necessarily have a high cost of returning home, if the weather turns out to be not good enough. That calculus is a little bit different for that segment of aviation. I guess what I'm trying to unpack a little bit more is who sees the business value in this? There's no doubt that there is a gap, but how do you monetize this? Who is it that will take that data, that new weather, granular micro low level weather and have a disproportionately higher impact on their business?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's a lot to unpack there, right? So, we could talk about the military. Military is about bombs on target, reaching objectives. It's a different calculus, right? It's also about asset efficiency, asset management, because if you have limited resources and low density, high demand assets, if they're getting canceled due to wet weather, unnecessarily, you're not covering an area over the battle space that needs to be covered. So I can make the argument from a military perspective, which I'm very good at because I was in it about how, you need to be considering efficiency and using your assets in the military environment because they're not unlimited, right? And I proved that at the TACC. So, in the year 2000, I got to the Tanker Airlift Control Center at Scott Air Force Base. I was asked to build a regional weather squadron. I was the first and we built it to 108 people. And then I was at the Air Operations Center. We also supported TACC. And the first thing I noticed is that I was watching how planners and dispatchers were making decisions about how to allocate those airlift assets in those refueling assets around the world. And I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Weather wasn't even in the calculus. They would just plan and say we don't change based on a weather forecast. You've heard that before. I know that because you're in the military, right? So I watched this for a while and I said to my boss, the two star General Woolley, I said, there's low hanging fruit here. You know, we're not perfect at forecasting, but I could tell you. We are certain about certain forecasts, and if we're certain enough about those, why don't we take that into consideration when we're planning these missions? It doesn't mean we change everything. Let's just take a very focused risk management approach to this, where if we're really confident you change that mission profile, you're going to save resources. So he, he was game and we did that. And in one year we cut the delays. They were averaging 5, 000 delays a year from weather out of 100, 000 missions. So 5% In one year we cut it to 1800. So AMC says, what does that mean for us? And I said, well, let's take it to your financial analysts. How many more aircraft do you need to make that up? And what we found was that we saved them 200 million with that. So that's what's falling on the floor today. So we got that study. I'll share it with you. It was validated and we were nominated for the Chief of Staff Team Excellence Award and AMC made us validate everything because they didn't want to be embarrassed, right? So fast forward, that's what I'm using right now for this whole industry. But that was a military example. Now let me give you a commercial example. So I was up at eVTOL Insights two years ago and I had been asked to make a presentation. I was going to be one of the later in the day presentations and there was an OEM, one that everybody knows and is well familiar with that got up in the morning and said, I just happened to be in New York City where I grew up. So you're really in my backyard and I understand weather there. And they said we're going to fly air taxies and we're going to fly eight missions a day with one eVTOL. I said, okay. And, he said, we're going to generate 14 million a year. And I sat there and said, no, you're not, you haven't included the 30 percent weather tax. And it was at that moment that I trademarked the term weather tax because it hit me. People have to understand who are the people that care most about money in a company, the CFO, right? If I use the term tax, that's going to get their attention. So I got up in the end of the day and I said, look, You got a 30 percent weather tax in New York City, and people look at me like, what are you talking about? And I said, that's the price Mother Nature imposes upon your business, both real or perceived, because part of that tax is the time that you ground yourself when you could fly, based on uncertainty. And I said, so you're really going to generate 9. 8 million per aircraft. That's what's going to happen. And, of course,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Why 30%?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, well, I took my lessons from the TACC, and I took, other data, that we've collected to show that, about, on the average, depending on the city, you know, it all changes. I also said all the weather tax is all local, like politics, right? It changes based on the regime and the weather. But, generally speaking, when I look at all the studies that have been out about AAM, they just look at actual real weather impacts. They say, oh, the weather will be 15 or 20 percent, 50 percent of the time you won't be able to fly, right? But I know that you have to add that uncertainty piece in. So I take that as an average. I feel pretty good about it, right? 30 percent of the time, you're gonna be, impacted if you don't build a better system. So I said to him, look, I said, 30 percent of that's recoverable. I'm pretty confident of that. Probably more, but let's just give you a low hanging fruit. 30 percent is recoverable. So I said, first of all, you're really going to only generate 9. 8. Which they didn't like. And I said, but I could get you back 30 percent of that. And I said, for each aircraft, if I have the right systems in place in an urban area, I could get you back 30%. Think about what that is. That's like 1. 2 million a year, right? Then I looked at him, I said, how much will you pay for that? I said, don't you tell me that, I'm going to talk to your CFO. I said, if I could show you that, how much would you pay? I maintain they'll pay at least five to one, four to one return on investment. We could generate two to three hundred thousand per aircraft for weather alone. We're working right now with NASA, We're implementing, Urban Weather Sensing testbed at Hampton, we're bringing it out to Dallas, it's going to be around Alliance Airport, and we're going to do more of the economic studies behind this. But my argument is that you will pay me for that, if I could show you that I can get you more flight time, and by the way, more reliability for your customer, and if we have the better data, we can keep you out of rough air, we don't have to get people sick. Who are not going to come back on these small vehicles if they're getting sick. All these things. So, it's really hard to believe, right? I mean that this is possible, but that's kind of where my whole career has taken me to this point. It's all been a lifetime of work to get here and then to see the possibilities and now we're acting upon it and hopefully, you know, we'll be successful.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For me, it's not that difficult to understand the value prop as you're describing to me, what I'm curious to learn more about is how do you convince those customers that this actually is achievable and is real, right? Because it kind of goes back to how do you convince people in one weather app being more accurate than another. There's no easy way to validate it. You need to run, large scale, experiments and testing and retroactive analysis. What is the second and third and the fourth conversation and the conversation with the CFO organization look like, can you give us a sense of their skepticism? You're having to convince them how this discussion evolves.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, I mean, that's the big problem, right? So that's why I didn't go into conventional aviation because that would be an impossible thing to prove. When I saw the new industry, I said, this is all new software. It's all open data systems. We have ability now to actually make a new market around weather that is working in concert with the industry in understanding how they're using data in all areas of the industry, not just weather. How the FAA is moving to a performance risk based standard for weather, but for everything in aviation. So this is really being embedded and baked in right now into the industry as we go along. NASA's given us several SBIRs and we're going to be going out to Alliance Airport around Hillwood and, and we're going to be putting in three scanning wing LIDARs. We're going to put in the infrastructure that we think is required to get the data we need to run the high resolution modeling and to then be able to run those models every 15 minutes with winds that are unimaginably accurate compared to what you have today. And we're gonna, we have an economist, and we're gonna work with the operators, and that's the next step in the process. I realize you have to prove it. The thing I'm saying is I have no doubt that once we collect that data, if somebody wants to deny it, then it's not going to be rational. It's going to be because of their own personal culture, what they've been raised in, and how insistent they are that the way we used to do it is the right way to do it. I think we'll be able to show that. I just have to sit down with the number counters and show them the results. We have to have a clean slate, we got to throw away the past, we got to look at the future, and then we got to realize the software that's being built in this new system is very easy to work with. So what I did with the ASTM, as I said, all weather data has to be translated into JSON, GeoJSON, not weather geekism. I mean, one of the problem with weather data is it comes in so many shapes and sizes that people can't even get to it to use it properly. So I'm taking a holistic approach and saying this industry is the test for what I'm saying and NASA's been behind us and the FAA's behind us. I'm not going to tell you yet that it's assured. But what I will tell you is that I know you can't do better without better data. There's no data in the urban canyons. You can't run CFD modeling without real data to know what's really happening.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the air taxi use case, like you go back to the New York scenario and you postulate that with these micro weather forecasts, predictions into the future, what the weather will be at that very granular locale, that these operators will be able to, fly more often, but how does that fit into their ability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Or carry more weight, or carry more\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>weight. Okay. But how does that fit into they're improving their profitability on their bottom line because how many hours or days ahead are they typically selling a ticket for that scheduled flight wherever the passenger is going and are you going to be forecasting, so far ahead of time that they can, cancel the flight before the ticket is sold? Or are they selling a ticket and then canceling a flight before departure? How does that time window work? And the contrast in commercial aviation is really quite different because. Well, number one, commercial aviation is so weather resilient that they only cancel when the weather gets to a real extreme. People are buying those tickets, days, weeks, even months ahead of time. But, you know, in, in the overall spectrum of weather, they're, they'll fly in instrument conditions, they'll fly in visual conditions, they'll fly in a lot of conditions and the transportation mode is pretty resilient to the weather, until you get to an extreme. But in these air taxis, from what I've gathered so far is a lot of these are going to be VFR operations. And so they themselves are just inherently more sensitive to weather conditions. If you realize this ability to predict whether it's not a weather observation, but it's the ahead of time factor that it brings, how does that match up with the eVTOL passenger when they plan to buy that ticket? And how does it mesh with, the operators, need to cancel and their ultimate profitability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good question. I'm going to give you a certain amount of information, then we're going to have to sign an NDA after that, okay? Because some of this is my secret\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>sauce.

But here's the thing is that, remember I said, you know, I'm not trying to solve the long range forecast problem. That's beyond my pay grade, right? As you mentioned earlier, you have to run large simulations. We're running a very localized microweather model that could be a 10 by 10 kilometer area or even less. We're going to use the initial conditions that come in from the bigger models. Then we're going to have our data coming in our sensors that nobody else has. And then we're going to nudge that and rerun that model with our data. And then we're going to run a short range forecast, probably out to six hours. Now, you might say to me, well, Don, is six hours enough? Well, the answer is, we're not trying to solve the whole problem. We're trying to go after the most impactful part of the problem. People are going to buy tickets when they buy them. The question is, and I always tell this to people in the military, because remember, I went to National War College, I have a degree in National Military Strategy, and I always brought weather in as part of the campaign, right? I believe weather is a weapon, weather, anticipate and exploit, you know, using it against the enemy. And I also ran an Air Force base. So I understand the logistics. I ran the main staging base in Afghanistan. And so I, I practice a lot of what I'm talking about today and I tested it in real life, but what I'm saying is that last six hours is the key, right? Because now you still have options at six hours out, or even three hours out. The key is not committing somebody to come to a VertiPort where they cannot take ground transportation to get to the airport. That's the key. Period. And that's what we're focusing on. And we're also building an intermodal system. We just won a DOT Smart Grant with Fort Worth, City of Fort Worth. We're going to bring weather into this, as well as air. And we're going to start looking at how, if you can't get to the VertiPort, or if the VertiPort cancels two hours ahead of time, can we get you in an Uber Black, what those road conditions are going to look like. All this predictability, we are just a chaotic transportation service today, right? This is about just bringing more discipline and better data into the system into these decisions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, help me out. So, one way to answer Peter's question, I believe. Again, you got me at today, most of your sensors are at the airports. So what you're saying is, I would assume with drone operations, drone delivery operations, eVTOL, those things that fly low altitude it's going to be, really important to have good weather. Peter's asking, so what? Peter's saying, well, what difference will it really make? So it's possible, even though they plan that advance. Very good point Peter on the commercial side. People already bought their tickets and they're already at the airport. Now it is true. They may not cancel because of weather, because they can fly in almost anything, but there'll be massive, unnecessary delays because isn't good weather prediction. And so I think that's a very big part of the 28 to 30 billion dollars. If I only knew really what was going to happen. So in your case, it's possible what you're saying is, because of the big chunks of grid today that weather is done on, if I know much more accurately where the real weather would be, because of your sensors, for example they're less apt to cancel flights that they otherwise would have cancelled because there is no weather in that spot. And I'm guessing that's where your three or four million dollars, a year per operation would come from. Is that right? Is that kind of the so what, the way I'm reading\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it? Yeah. You got it. So what is, today you would can't, you know, you might have, I've seen this already. I've worked with some companies where they would have to cancel going back to Peter's point. I was driving away from the long range into the short range. So what was happening is they were doing testing, of some of these concepts. And they would have to cancel the mission two or three hours in advance because they didn't want to bring the people out to the VertiPort only to be stuck there. Or in the opposite state, you're at the airport and they're expecting an air taxi, and now you're not going to have it. So they're going to have to find another means of transportation. That's not as bad as the other one, right? Where you can't get to the VertiPort and now you've waited. You're only an hour and a half before takeoff because you thought you were going to fly there, and now you can't get to the airport now because traffic in those areas won't allow it. So, they were making this no go decision about two, two and a half hours before. Well, a lot of times they could have flown, and this is something they told me. So that's where the 30 percent comes in, right? So now we bring them out 30 percent of the time more than we did, and they're going to fly and they're going to make money. And they're not going to be sitting there with the empty aircraft sitting on the VertiPort, not flying and all the costs that goes with that. Does that help a little bit? I'm glad you helped me tease that out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It does. Help me out a little bit with, drone delivery services. Our sense is that eVTOLs are still several years away at scale, potentially more than that. some would say, but drone service delivery is happening today, and it's going to happen at scale a whole lot faster, arguably, than eVTOL operations. How does micro weather help, now you got me talking only micro weather, so you've trained me. How does micro weather help make a difference to the drone service delivery Does it really, will they make any different decisions based on better weather.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I would say just on, on Jim's question, when you're thinking about drone delivery, and let's just take last mile drone delivery, because so many people have a pretty vivid picture of what it is, that's going to operate more based on microweather observations than forecasts. And, you know, consumers will open the app and they will either be able to place that order or not, because this is all taking place within a matter of minutes. It's, you know, it's not like I'm ordering something three, four, five, six hours ahead of time and making some kind of a decision based on that. It's immediate. So it's just, okay, what is the weather along this two, three mile route right now or 15 minutes in the future? And can we go?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the things I want to point out is micro weather doesn't become as important if you're not flying scheduled missions. If you're not depending on velocity, where your business model depends on having a lot of flights, right? If you're doing surveillance on a pipeline And you could wait another day. It doesn't become as much of an issue. So, the drone delivery one is one of those that really depends on volume. And so every mission you don't fly you're dropping revenue that probably hasn't been told to your investor about how much the weather challenge is. So there's a lot of pressure on these companies. You got to remember, it's not like the current airlines who have baked in weather already, right? These are all folks that are going after VC money or other money. And they're, you know, they're embellishing a little bit of their abilities to fly, 95 percent of the time when it's really maybe around 20, right? So now they're already behind the power curve. The challenges with drone delivery is the winds above the tree level is not measurable and we see a lot of difference in the winds above tree level than the models put in there. The battery power issue, the weight carried issue. It just adds chaos into the system as well as the problem of you have to have three miles visibility you have to you know, be 500 feet below a cloud deck, all those things. Right. So you notice, I even talk about a thunderstorm because the thunderstorm stuff we see coming. It's the micro weather that's invisible or not notable that's going to hurt their business model. So, So, you're right. Now, one thing I will say, Peter, is that you really need about an hour, ahead of time because, you gotta remember there is an operation, there are people loading drones, they're running around the store picking stuff up, so, you know, if somebody puts in an order, it's not like it's gonna happen in 10 minutes, generally, right? So you have to think about the flow. So, if you have, I don't know, just to say you have 15 drones at a Walmart someday, right? That's 15 drones. That's a lot of drones? So every 10 minutes you're not flying when you can fly, you've just dropped 15 drone flights. So even the short range, and you do need the data, as you said. So what we've been advocating for is let's get some wind sensors on towers at 200 feet, 100 feet, 150 feet. Let's get above the tree line. Once we know what the winds are really doing, which we don't have today, that takes away some of the mystery immediately about power management, distance traveled, wind shear, there's other things I could talk about. And then let's get a ceilometer at every Walmart or wherever you're flying from so we can see the cloud height, measure it, because right now they're using the nearest METAR. And the nearest METAR could be 15 miles away and it may not even be relevant. You've been on airports where one half of the runway is IFR and the other half is clear, right? I used to, that happened to me at Kunsan. I used to get yelled at all the time by the wing commander because we would call it seven miles visibility but the approach end of the runway, which was less than a quarter of the area drone, was socked in but I couldn't call that visibility. He threatened to put me on a boat at the end of the runway to take my weather observation. So, my point is that all that comes together. So you're right. The data is important. Having that extra information is important. And then you still need a short range forecast for your flow to manage your logistics, right? To make sure you're not taking orders that you know you're not going to be to\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>meet. Don, you mentioned earlier that about 40 percent of drone flights are canceled due to weather. Can you talk more about that? And, you know, maybe be a little bit more specific who do you refer to when you mentioned this, and if you talk to drone delivery organizations that are really starting to have some meaningful and interesting scale, companies like Wing, like Manna. Do they have this problem? Do they, complete your sentences when you talk about the issues of winds aloft and how they're not able to predict those and how this impacts their customer service ultimately. Do you have an agreement on the impact that this is having on their operation and how do they think about this? Do you work with them? Do you provide services to them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good question. So what I will tell you is I, we are a Drone Ups company. I'm proud of the fact that they hired us, over another company after they realized that what we're producing is meaningful to them. They've acknowledged the challenges of micro weather, keep in mind that, when I say 40%, it doesn't mean the weather was bad 40 percent of the time. It means that you just don't know. So, that statistic really depends on where you're, what your weather challenges are, right? Some people might think, oh, in Phoenix, you probably don't have a 40 percent attrit. Well, I don't know the winds, right? The winds above the ground, you know, they can't handle 30 knots of wind necessarily above the ground, right? So your weather attrit is not seemingly the same as what you would think about for a regular aviation, right? That number seems high if you're not really on the ground and understanding what's happening. What we tell them, you know, is that we'll get you that, some of that back. And it means that you have to buy into the whole system. You've got to buy into the system of better sensors above tree level, some ceilometers, the way that we, aggregate data and present it through custom, outputs for locale and your decisions. You've got to make very systematic approaches to how decisions are made. You can't leave it up to a local pilot, to make that decision because they don't have the big picture. So this is the kind of work we're doing with DroneUp is trying to figure out how do we, really, you know, it's not just the data collection side, it's also the decision side, right? And how you build the system so that those decisions are made in a systematic fashion, that there's a stable process. I could talk about other drone companies. I don't want to do that because some drone companies don't want to admit there's a problem yet because they're still trying to, raise money. Others, are doing certain things that they feel they can handle it themselves, which may be possible. I just know I've been in the business long enough to know that you can't, if you're going to be a successful low altitude drone company or eVTOL company, you can't just look at weather as a data supplier. You have to have partnerships. There's even a meteorologist piece to this. There'll be times when you're going to have an area that has lots of drones that you want to fly and there's a system coming in and the models are going to say, you know, that system will be, you'll be getting rain at 30%. You know, one of the things I'm finding is what does a 40 percent chance of rain mean? Do you cancel? How do you make a decision with that, right? So, what we say is you talk to our meteorologist, we'll help, we'll get you an extra hour of flight time, potentially, because we say, oh, that 40 percent is happening north, it's not going to move down into your area for another hour. There's no automated weather today that could be the heuristical part of that, like you used to get when you talk to a forecaster. There's still going to be a requirement to have meteorologists in a loop until we're perfect at forecasting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Assuming a drone delivery operation is happening from a hub and covers, let's say a four mile radius, how much does it cost a drone operator to instrument this particular area with the necessary sensors, and then also get the meteorological service from you. What is that burden on an annual basis or on a per flight basis, and how does that fit into the overall economics of those delivery operators?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so I don't want to give you all those details because that's my IP, but what I will tell you is this. Our goal is to get them four times return on investment. When we talk about sensors, when we talk about integration, when we talk about APIs, and when we talk about getting those APIs properly integrated into, their decision support systems that they're doing. And when we talk about even having a forecaster in the loop every now and then, you don't have them every day, you only have them on the edge cases, you call them up. The goal is a 4 to 1 return on investment. So I'll give you an example. If they're losing, 40 percent of their missions today, we want to get it down to 30%. And if that revenue, we want to get you, we want to get you, you know, we don't want you to pay more than 25 percent of what that savings is. And that doesn't even get into the cost avoidance piece. I'm just talking about revenue right now. We're not even talking about people that are standing around and I've seen this doing nothing because they're waiting for the rain to end, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It seems like, the customers who could benefit the most from this, if I'm interpreting your, arguments correctly are the, high frequency, low altitude operators, drone delivery operations, for instance, right in the near term. Those are also, customers who are very pressured by, cost. And they are looking at every single cent and asking themselves the question, can I afford to spend this cent because my unit economics are really challenging to maintain and achieve. We see this often with, all kinds of supplemental data providers that yes, have a lot of value, but, you know, drone operators might only have the capacity to pay cents per flight for some of this data. So in that context, how do they prioritize the value of weather data and their willingness to, give up margin for it, as opposed to best effort, if I need to cancel a flight, I'll cancel a flight, I'll send it a minute later or a couple of minutes later, because it's really at a small scale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first of all, all those other methods cost money. So if you've canceled a mission because you didn't have good data, and you then had to drive that or find an Uber Eats guy to take it, you've just spent money. We're looking at this the wrong way. You're looking at weather as a cost of doing business. Weather is an enabler to make money. That's the problem I run into all the time. I'm not criticizing. I'm saying that what we're up against is a culture of how people think about weather. Everyone thinks about the cost, but nobody recognizes weather's costing them. You know, there's no such thing as free weather data. It's costing you. So, what I would tell you is this, and again, some of this has to be proven, but I'm, you know, there's an old saying, I don't know this to be a fact, but I know it to be true, right? Weather may cost you overall today, 60 cents a drone flight when you amortize all the impacts of weather on your ecosystem. If you amortize that cost, it might cost you 60 cents a drone flight. Alright, if you start paying me 15 cents a drone flight, I'm not, I'm using this as an example, and I save you 60 cents, I don't understand where the problem is. Why are we prioritizing? You're going to have to lay somebody off instead, or you're going to have to cut costs somewhere else, or, and this is what I say all the time in weather. It's amazing how much value there is here that people haven't realized yet, and they're actually cutting costs in areas that they don't have to if they just have a smarter weather system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. These drone companies that, that we've talked to, they have weather minimums where they are flying with about a 50 percent safety margin on wind conditions, rain, etc. So they have a pretty wide safety margin for their go no go. But obviously they want better dispatchability. They want to fly more often.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we want to get that safety margin down.

I mean, and a lot of it has its roots in the amount of energy that the drone can bring along with it on the mission. And so we know batteries are getting better. We know drones are being built that can handle stronger winds. They can handle more moisture in the air. Icing will always be a challenge, but short of that, I think we see the weather performance of these drone systems improving a lot in the coming years. So, how does that trend fit in with what you are offering to them on a forecast basis? And I would just assume that they're going to, keep the same 50 percent type safety margin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:04:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, if you're assuming they're going to keep the same 50 percent safety margin, then there's no business model. Because that, they're, for some reason, they're doing that. But back to the, the question, the bottom line is this, is that we have very sophisticated aircraft today that are manned and they, and we still ground these aircraft 30 percent of the time unnecessarily. The same thing is going to happen when you have your very sophisticated drones. If you ever use the term all weather, be careful, because there's no such thing. I've been told we can have all weather aircraft since 1980s. There's no all weather aircraft. The more you engineer, the more weight you put on an aircraft, there's always a trade off between engineering, weight, and everything else. So I've been in this a long time. It really comes to this way. You have to improve your engineering, but you have to improve your weather resiliency from a prediction standpoint. You have to work them both together. There's no one or the other. You're always going to have weather impacts and you're always going to have margins that you're going to give up if you don't improve the data. I mean, why wouldn't you want to invest in better data and get more margin and get more flights. I mean, this doesn't make sense to me. I mean, maybe I'm, I don't know. I don't get it. Right. I don't get why you have to have a 50 percent safety if you're got better weather data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there other alternative funding sources that are available for your capability or your competitors?

To answer your question, I don't expect the operators to pay, the full cost of this. There's two things I want to mention. Number one is once we get these low altitude weather networks out, they're going to be able to serve other verticals that today are underserved. So if you think about the urban canyons, there's a lot of air pollution. There's a lot of concern about how air pollution moves around transport through urban canyons. This data is not only going to be valuable to aviation, it's going to become valuable to many other verticals and they will buy it at some point. This just hasn't been a business model. The second thing I want to mention is that the states, can invest in infrastructure. So the way I break it down is this way. You have strategic weather infrastructure and then you have tactical weather infrastructure. The strategic weather infrastructure would be like those scanning wind lidars. You don't expect companies to pay, anybody to pay for that, right? Either that's going to be private investment, helping to fund that, that would then, you know, buy into that based on the business model, or we look at public private partnerships like toll roads. Right? So we could see that the states, there's like five business models where the states can actually buy some infrastructure, but then just contract out the maintenance, the data processing, and then, you know, you work out the business model with the state. Maybe, they get a discount for all public safety to use the data, right? And then you charge commercial some fee. There's a bunch of different business models that can make this work, which is why, I'm not landing on one solution. I'm still figuring out all the things that you guys have brought up, I'm well aware of. And so I've been working on the approaches to try to get around those, objections, right? So to speak, to try to find a way to make this work, to make it profitable and make it work. So I don't see the, drone operators having to buy all the infrastructure. I see them buying a service. And that's really where we want to get to. Now, they may still want to buy some of their own equipment for takeoff and landing location that only they have, right, like a ceilometer. But, if we can get everybody to share their data, you've got real data now coming in where you can improve cloud ceiling forecasts over an area to get a much better understanding. Today they don't know what they're going to fly in if they can't see it. There's no data. You don't know if it's IFR around that ridge. You don't know. So that means they have to stay grounded until they know and things like that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, can you share some, thoughts, observations, what it's like being an entrepreneur and building a, a weather business thoughts for aspiring founders in this industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you know, you guys got an idea of what it's like, because you've been asking me very good, challenging questions. And by the way, I do appreciate it, because, what we're really trying to do is very hard on a number of levels, right? You got the policy. Which I've worked on with FAA and ASTM to try to, you know, make it more favorable to bring in third party weather providers into the aviation industry. You've got the science and technology, which is all cutting edge. Everything we're doing is on the edge of technology and science. It hasn't been that this stuff hasn't existed before. It's been in the universities and labs a long time, but no one's ever pulled it together into a, you know, into a production system and make it into a business case that could work. And then you've got the culture in aviation, like, the questions you guys are asking. These are all good questions. They're all real problems. They're all real objections that I have to overcome. and that's hard. That takes a lot of energy, right? If I could have probably invented the pogo stick and it would have been a hell of a lot easier, right? But I like hard challenges because I've been in this industry so long, I've been fed up that we haven't been able to really change the aviation system, right? It's been the same system for years and it just doesn't make sense to me that we're kind of happy with it when it's so disruptive and costs so much. So, and then selling my investors. Right? So, this is not an easy sell. You have to find people that really get in and understand that it's really about the data. It's not about weather, right? It's about the data. It's about what the data can do. Why is it every other part of the industry says we need better data to make decisions, but weather, eh, we don't need better data. This will work fine. I mean, I just, it's so baffling to me. And I understand it. I think it's the culture. I think it's the way people have been brought up. I think it's just the system. And it's also, really difficult to understand what we're trying to do and understand why it will work. So I get all that. That's, what's been the hardest part. I mean, this, building the business, hard because you need money, hard because we need customers. What I am confident about right now is we will get them. So what's the second problem? The second problem is the pace by which this industry is actually growing. And I would tell people that are, trying to, build a business in this industry, not just weather, is you gotta have patience and you gotta have recognize it's never going to go as fast as you think it is. Don't dilute yourself thinking, that you're gonna, you know, do something different than everyone else, because you can't if the policy doesn't change, you can't if the FAA doesn't change the policy. And the other thing is these, all these other companies I work with, they're all doing new software too, which is what I love, by the way. And they all have their challenges. Like you said, Peter, they may not be ready to invest in weather, right? They may not be ready to invest in something else. So, I think, the key is, you have to know what you're getting into. You got to understand that it's a different animal. We're basically building an aircraft and flying at the same time in this industry writ large. It's not an established industry where you're trying to do something that's entrepreneurial and innovative, and it's challenging.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And as we wrap up, what's, one message that you would like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think, you know, again, I think this has been a great conversation.

It was good.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I hope it wasn't like that.

I do believe that what we're doing is the right thing I'm always more than happy to have more conversations about this. I want to you know, there's things I still have to learn There's people that probably can help me figure out how to crack the nut Right? So I don't want you to think that I have all the answers. what I'm just going to say though is weather imposes uncertainty. And uncertainty in anything costs money. And, the only way that you're going to resolve that is by having real data to fill in that uncertainty gap. And if the data can give you the ROI and you can demonstrate it, believe it. If I can show you this, believe it, right? The implementation part is hard because the companies we're working with have to bring their company along with this, right? Who, again, have a lot of people who would say, Oh, why are we doing this data? I get it from ForeFlight. I can see my weather, you know. So, this is a multi faceted problem, right? That's why you have to come in at the CFO level and in the COO and CEO level. Because, you really got to have a buy in by the company up and down to say, yeah, this is the direction we're going to go in because it makes sense. It's the future of weather. It's the future of, networked information and it's the future of analytics. So you want good weather data in there. Why are you going to spend a billion dollars on all these other systems that are going to give you perfect data and then you're going to use weather as your weakest link in the tent? It doesn't make sense to me. Why invest in all that if it's, this is your weakest link in your chain, right? So that's my takeaway.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we certainly enjoyed it as well, Don.

I think that a lot of economy of scale pricing for commercial components is on the idea that those really large scale orders come in very few and far between, and I'm not sure that their profit margins are going to hold when they start getting multiple orders at the high end of those economy scales. So I think we may see some pricing innovations come out of the commercial sector. And I think we may also see what I have mentally been referring to is like Kirkland brand options for drone components. Just like you can go to Costco and you can get your Kirkland brand for fill in the blank. I think we may start seeing that in the drone industry as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Kara Kramer, Director of Business Development at AeroVironment. So this is a discussion around the evolving role of UAS in warfare, including in Ukraine. The critical role of the supply chain to ensure we can properly engage in when those wars, and the recent announcement of the U S Replicator Initiative. What it is. Why it happened and what it is intended to achieve. So Kara immediately jumps into the fragility of our UAS supply chain. Something we've talked a lot about over the last couple of years, but she says that with all of the talk and awareness, not much has really been done about it relating to our preparation for UAS in warfare. And speaking of vulnerable supply chains, we discuss how batteries essential to UAS and UAS warfare are often sourced in China. Speaking of vulnerabilities. Then we enter a very cool discussion that the outcome of future wars, as Peter says, may revolve around high volume electronics. And how lethality is coming in, smaller, smaller packages and where the need for secure supply chains becomes perhaps even more important. We discuss the state of the UAS market, particularly defense in UAS and especially around mass. How many drones can you produce and field? How quickly can you scale what's needed to maintain scale? And lastly, how would you rise to meet that demand? Kara discusses, how mass is achieved and how DOD is forecasting orders is the greatest limiting factor and how even large businesses can't invest without effective DOD forecasting requirements. Without the forecast and the requirements that businesses can't and won't justify investments to meet that future demand. And to achieve mass we have to lower the cost and to lower the cost we may have to have an established electronic space and today's BOM or bill material is four to five times higher than equivalent Chinese drones. We discuss the impact of Ukraine on UAS and the impact it's having on our vision of future wars. I really like Luka's question about air superiority. And the role of UAS and that you may never really have air superiority, as long as UAS exists in the battlefield. And we discuss contested logistics, how to get the supplies out to the time and place of need. What a shift from previous conflicts where in future conflicts, like in Ukraine, It's going to be very challenging to have complete air superiority. This is one of my favorite, what I consider to be most relevant parts of the podcast. Then we discuss DOD's Replicator Initiative and what drove its birth, how it surprised industry, how it will leverage unmanned systems to prepare for mass and how it's meant to address the growing threat from China. We discussed the need to move from exquisite group five drones to high volume, high attrition, UAS vehicles. And another great section we discussed startups, listen to what Kara says are their advantages and what she said should be the focus areas for startups. And a really interesting section around counter UAS, the market size, the lack of a real leader and the real demand. Finally listen to what Kara sees as the future of warfare and her advice to you our entrepreneurs. Kara, thank you for joining us for an impressive discussion and to our listeners enjoy our conversation with Kara Kramer as you innovate in The Vertical Space.

I think about the fact that all of our edge computing comes from one single foundry in Taiwan, all of our NVIDIA chips, and that we, as we're thinking about preparing for the next great power conflict, we haven't thought enough about diversifying away from that, the one, there's one specific boundary in Taiwan. So that's, I think one thing people don't agree with me on is that fixation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Has it changed at all in the last couple of years, based on the reality of the supply chain\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think COVID woke folks up to how fragile the supply chain can actually be. It was even something as simple as consumers not being able to get toilet paper. I think it was an eye opening experience for folks when they start thinking about supply chains for critical weapon systems that have one, maybe two provider of a part that it will not operate without. I think COVID 19 made it real. But what I haven't seen is, I've seen a lot of discussions around how we're going to make it better, but I haven't seen a whole lot of action on it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When did you begin to form that view and what keyed you into it first?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what actually keyed me into it is it was back when I was at a company called Thomson Reuters. so Thomson Reuters is a Canadian data company. they own Reuters News and a whole bunch of other Data sources, you probably have no idea, roll up under them. While I was there, I was doing some work for, the defense department looking at supply chains for GPUs, graphical processing units, and that's when I first realized how many just critical components for weapons systems were coming out of TSMC, which is a foundry in Taiwan. And you'd see fluctuations in the GPU market caused by video game popularity. And then you'd see cryptocurrency would rise, and then that would put a strain on GPUs as well. And then folks in the military could not get what they needed because of a really popular video game. And that's when I started to really realize how fragile this could be and what a risk this is creating for us, especially as we're looking at the future of warfare that is largely focused on that exact geographic region.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Yes. And what you bring up, really pulls forward some historical lessons in modern warfare. If we look back over the last century, take World War II as an example, like many modern wars, it was ultimately decided by the strength of the respective industrial bases in the countries that were fighting and the U. S. had, I think an advantage going in with the automotive industry that it had already built and the mass production capacity that was throughout the supply chain in the U. S. And if what we're looking at here in this, next iteration of warfare is that the aspects of the industrial base that will be decisive are around, let's call it high volume electronics and the semiconductors that drive them. Then, I don't think that the U. S. has anything resembling leadership in that, I think that a lot of that capacity has, over the last 30 years, really developed in Asia. And so for us to, change that as a country and our industrial base, it's not something that we can just say, hey, we need this and a year later, it shows up. Would you agree with that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, I would absolutely agree with that. And especially with the rising demand for what folks are calling attritable assets in the battlefield.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's only going to put more pressure on the supply chain when you can't cannibalize old systems for parts to keep the new systems in the fight. How will the supply chain keep up with that? How can you price that to be a attritable when there's one specific semiconductor on there that just, you can't get right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think we're seeing, lethality show up in smaller and smaller packages in modern warfare and what we're learning from the conflict in Ukraine, and we're seeing, looking ahead, more and more automation being built into weapon systems and certainly the Chinese are developing, what you might call truly autonomous weapon systems. But to whatever degree that you decide to imbue that automation into these systems, it gives anyone the opportunity to really scale it out and have very high volumes of systems on the battlefield. And just the numerical scale of it can be an overwhelming and decisive factor. If that's the way things play out in the future, then, from our standpoint, where are we going to develop the capacity in the manufacturing base to deliver that scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Kara you're not saying that people necessarily disagree with you on this point, before you answer Peter's question. It's more, people may not be as aware of the vulnerability of the supply chain. And it directly relates to, military use of drones, for example, as Peter's referring to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. Because it's one of those pieces that folks look at, they look at the drone and they think of that as a commercial part that goes in there as something you can go on your computer and you can order, it just comes. in the mail for you. It's not something you're going to consider, like a critical component until you can't get it or until the price skyrockets because there's such a shortage in what's available. And what we were talking about with the autonomy piece and trying to push autonomy out en masse, our policy dictates that we need to have a human in the loop for anything that's going to be regarding lethality. Which means for a human to be in the loop there needs to be a video feed so they can make that determination. And that video feed is going to require edge processing of some kind. And that's where you're going to hit that, you're going to hit that roadblock every time. But my other truly controversial, people don't agree with me on this, I think that our policy around the human in the loop limitation will only last as far as, the first few days of a peer adversary conflict.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interesting. play that scenario out for us, Kara, will you?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, based on what you can read in the news, you have a pretty good idea that our adversaries are not limited by the same policies around your AI and your lethality decisions. And so you're talking about meeting a peer or near peer adversary out in mass when they're not limited by the same restriction. And you're talking about fielding thousands of autonomous systems at once in swarms? And you need to keep a human in the loop for every single decision that involves a kinetic effect. It just, it's hard to imagine how that's going to scale well, and how we're going to remain committed to that policy, as we engage in, or hopefully never engage in a conflict like that. But if we were to, I don't think it would happen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If it's in the opening days of the war, where there's only one side in a certain direction you can have a, quote, kill box and instruct the autonomous systems to engage whatever is past a certain boundary, but once the troops start mixing, then this becomes a lot more complicated scenario to, work through.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I agree completely. It becomes almost dystopian to think about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the supply chain fragility topic, besides the video links, what other specific UAS components do you think are most impacted?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Probably batteries. So I've been in the UAS industry for not as long as most people, but for a while. And one of the hardest pieces to source that doesn't touch China is batteries. And when, especially when you're talking about small, attritable UAS, they're going to be operating off batteries to be likely sourced from China. So as soon as that would be shut off, that would be problematic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's zoom out a little bit and just, share your perspectives on the market. Describe the state of the UAS market today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure, I'd be happy to. So most of my statements are going to be focused more on that defense part of the market, not commercial. So the biggest focus of the market that I'm seeing right now is around mass, is how many can you produce, how quickly can you field that, and a lot of that's driven by the conflicts overseas. So Ukraine is a huge demand signal for systems. It's also a proving ground for new technology, and it's been, a time where you can see innovation happening in real time in a way that we haven't had that ability to do so. And then you're also seeing. You're seeing people, like, the situation in Israel and Gaza, you're seeing our allies going through their reserves, and you're seeing how quickly that can happen. So you're feeling, in the industry, you're feeling a lot of that demand of how quickly could you scale, what would be required to maintain that scale, and some, almost like an excitement, but also a little bit of trepidation around how you would rise to meet that demand. Also seeing a lot of, push towards the smaller systems that have a higher level of endurance. That's a challenge for both physics and power, but that's been a kind of, a rising trend in the drone industry. It's almost as popular now, in my vision, than the eVTOL space that you've seen with the Air force's Agility Prime and all the providers around that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the topic of mass, how do you think this is achieved? Where do you see the limiting factor? Is it in the, parts as we discussed just moments ago, or is it in manufacturing processes to accommodate that level of low cost and production at scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in my viewpoint, it boils down to forecasting orders. That's the biggest limfac for the industry rising to meet the challenge of mass is that there's a lot of discussion around how we will achieve mass, what kind of manufacturing facilities we need it. But the truth is that's well within America's wheelhouse to rise to meet that challenge. But even large businesses can't invest in the facilities and start to manufacture at that scale until they have at least a few years of forecasted orders coming in from the government that would allow them to make that investment. And so that creates a catch 22 where, the government may not be ready to put in those orders because what would they do with that mass if they didn't need it and that industry can't prepare at risk because they don't have any certainty on it, and they either have to answer to their investors and their board, or they have to answer to their shareholders about how they're managing that fiduciary responsibility. But it also means we will be in a situation where we'll likely have to try to scale really quickly when the time does need it, unless the government invests in it ahead of time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, in your mind, for a country to deliver that type of mass, how important or helpful is it, for that country to already have a domestic consumer electronics industry that is enabling high volume production, of related types of products. Is that really a requirement in order to be able to turn and have the industrial base deliver high volumes of these types of systems?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In my opinion, yes, absolutely, because to, to achieve mass, you have to lower the cost. And a big part of lowering the cost is using as many commercially available parts as possible in your system. And those commercially available parts have to be available to you. You can't have a six month lead time for the electronics that are going to go into your system. Because those lead times build upon themselves. And all of a sudden you have this attritable mass that will be available in the next 12 to 36 months, which potentially is not as helpful as we'd like.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what do you see as the state of the consumer electronics industrial base in the U. S. and, how far away is it from, being able to support the type of demand in the military space that we're looking at?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know that I would call myself an expert on the consumer electronics industry, domestically, I will say that, generally speaking, in my experience, you end up having to seek out the best performance for the dollar in order to meet your obligation to the government, as well as to the taxpayer. And that, generally speaking, isn't always going to be domestic. Unless there's a regulation that's blocking you and forcing you to go domestic, you will be, in general, trading off performance to stay domestic. And so I think until that gap is closed and the domestic electronics perform the same way, it's going to be, it's going to be a limfac for us.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>19:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I've heard, anecdotal accounts of, people who are doing systems integration, to build domestically sourced drone platforms. And they've related to me that to build something with equivalent capability to a Chinese drone, the bill of materials is four to five times more than what that Chinese drone costs. And so if we were to think about domestically building up an industrial base that had the depth and that therefore could be cost competitive, is there a way to do it that bypasses already having a consumer electronics manufacturing base in the country? Is there a way to do it as you talk about, working with allied partners or building that capacity in another fashion?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My theory is that we'd likely have to work with allied partners to get to the point where we would be anywhere close to the cost of Chinese made parts. I mean, there's a reason why you're not buying an iPhone made in California. You wouldn't like that price, and it may not work the same way your previous iPhones did, and even if you could achieve the same performance the price is going to be well past what you would consider reasonable to spend. So, if you have a system, a UAS system, that is completely NDA compliant, meets all the blue list and green list requirements, it's not going to cost anywhere close to your DJI type equivalent, even if the performance is equivalent. And that is the price that the government has to pay right now, and it is one of the, it's one of the stumbling blocks for achieving mass, is that, we've set up a situation where even hundreds of millions of dollars isn't going to get you the same mass that a hundred millions of dollars for another country would.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And, numerically, what do you think of in terms of, being mass? Is it a thousand? Is it 10, 000? Is it a million? and looking at, Ukraine perhaps as an example that gives us some kind of bedrock off of which to think about this, what do you see as the level of mass in these systems that is going to deliver, an advantage on the battlefield?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I love that question. How would I define mass is right up there with how I would define attritable. It's going to depend, largely, and there is no definition that everyone's going to agree to. I think for what we're generally speaking about mass would be in the hundreds. We don't have any systems that I'm aware of that we could do in the thousands or ten thousands, or at least it wouldn't come from, one provider because of the cost would just be really prohibitive to do that. And in Ukraine, you're able to achieve mass with hundreds, but you're also facing a high degree of attrition. Which is to be expected in a conflict. And so part of, the math is just keeping the water at the same line as when you started, even if there's a leak at the bottom of the cup.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>22:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Kara, one of your earlier comments where you were saying that there's difficulty in forecasting demand. I mean, even in light of the kinds of attrition that we're hearing is happening in Ukraine and how little, arsenal the West, especially in Europe, seems to be having right now. Even in light of that, there is, you're saying, uncertainty or unwillingness to forecast demand with some certainty.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>22:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. There absolutely is that. Because there is uncertainty around the continuity of the funding being an even flow. So, in order to be prepared to build a stockpile, that would be an investment the government has to make. Companies themselves generally do not stockpile systems at all. They're just going to have exactly as much as what's ordered and any spares associated. They're not going to have anything extra that would be laying around unless the government instructed them to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, we're just coming off a podcast talking about eVTOLs with Dr. Manning and Dr. Bourdain, and we've been talking about autonomy with eVTOLs and AAM. Set the stage for us a little bit of what's driving the demand for mass what's happening with Ukraine that is different than we saw a year ago, let's say. And then second, how is this translating what's going on with Gaza right now?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I love that question, and I would say that from my viewpoint, what's driving the demand for mass is actually coming out of the Indo Pacom area more than anything. that's where that drive is coming from. Indo Pacom is going to be your Asia Pacific region of the world, and that region is defined by this, what is affectionately called a tyranny of distance. Meaning you aren't going to be able to have a central base, you're not going to be able to quickly resupply, you're not going to have runways necessarily, and there is just going to be a significant amount of inescapable maritime factors in whatever you have going on. So a lot of that focus on mass is looking at that tyranny of distance and imagining that you're across this great, vast expanse and you're also in an area where you maybe do not have traditional communication means available to you, the navigation would be limited, but you still need to conduct operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Given that we have the problems we have today in meeting the demand, were we anticipating this a year or two ago? Has Ukraine changed our view at all? Has what's gone in Gaza changed? Or is it still an Asian focus and Ukraine has had little impact?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>25:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think Ukraine's been hugely impactful for understanding how important unmanned systems will be in the current and the coming conflicts. I've heard folks refer to Ukraine as the drone war, where it's the first war where we're having drones versus drones happening in the battlefield. We saw lots of drone operations happening in Afghanistan and Iraq, but it was normally just we were using drones, and we weren't seeing folks using them against us in the same way we are in Ukraine. In Ukraine, you're seeing Russia using loitering, munitions. You're seeing Ukrainians use loitering, munitions, and you're seeing that signal jamming going back and forth and then the Ukrainians are having to adapt on the fly to, to be able to still operate and keep their assets in the air.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>25:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's been the biggest lesson learned from the war in Ukraine and how drones are used there for you personally, Kara?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the biggest lessons learned. It's probably the importance of having more drone operators in these militaries is that Ukraine has done a great job on ramping up on having their training catch up. But that's been one of the things that they've had to catch up on is having enough people who can operate the drones because the U. S. can drop off a Connex box full of them. But if they don't know how to operate it, then it's not going to be useful to them. So I think having that training tail be ahead of conflicts is probably one of the biggest lessons learned.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the types of drones that the Ukrainians have had the most success with or that are in the most numerous use on the part of the Ukrainians?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know that I can answer that definitively. I think most of it is going to be in that sensitive information category. to plug AeroEnvironment, I would say that they've been having a lot of luck using the Switchblades in the engagements. It's one of the unmanned systems that you're going to see referred to often in publications. And that's because the loitering munitions are pretty ideal for this type of conflict because they can stay up in the air for up to 25 minutes. And then they have that kinetic impact as well that it's providing, like, close air support without needing actual close air support in the battlefield.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One thing that the war in Ukraine highlighted from the get go is the need for air superiority which has been absent and therefore resulted in the kind of trench warfare that we're seeing. Now, it seems like that concept is extending to the realm of drones as well. So it seems like going forward, especially in these kinds of operational scenarios, there's no true air superiority if you also cannot protect the skies from drones. So how do you think air superiority will be achieved in a world where a few hundred dollar drones can be sent up, en masse, and disrupt, lines, make everything visible. There's no safe haven anymore. You can't maneuver with the kinds of vehicles that you're used to maneuvering because you'll be picked up very easily by a surveillance drone that's just, saturating the front lines. How does air superiority get achieved in a world that looks like that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think air superiority is going to end up looking almost like an arms race between UAS and counter UAS. Meaning, I think that you're going to see a prevalence of unmanned systems making a real impact in a conflict, and then you're going to see a meteoric rise of a specific counter UAS technology that is then neutralizing that. And then you're going to see the UAS innovation catch up and figure out a way to operate around that. So you're going to see a ping pong back and forth between counter UAS, and UAS, capabilities. I don't think you'll ever achieve full air dominance in the battlefield as long as there are unmanned systems. There's always going to be one, that's either, smaller, flies lower, flies higher, you fill in the blank. They're always going to get some through. It's more going to be about trying to achieve dominance versus, like, absolute conquest.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Peter today, sent us an article by Ian Lovett from the Wall Street Journal that talked about the impact of drones on even logistics, as you were, mentioning Kara. I mean, it's amazing to think that the, the combatants in Ukraine can't even be bringing forward supplies in the vehicles they traditionally brought them forward with because of the use of drones. And they can pick up on the different vehicles and the, I mean, you talk about air superiority, the impact that drones has even on the supply chain and the devastating effect it can be if you don't have a secure supply chain or logistical tail, that's amazing, what are your perspectives on that? Are you surprised by it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, I'm not surprised at all. In the DoD, it's commonly just referred to as contested logistics, right? And that's a huge pain point. It's how are you going to get the supplies out to the time and place of need. Because we can't send the warfighter out and think that we can't resupply them. And the thought of not being able to do that, I think is a paradigm shift for our military. In our past conflicts, we've not had points in time traditionally, there's always going to be exceptions. We haven't had points in time where we can't get supplies out to the warfighter. And we're preparing for a conflict where it may be very challenging to do that. And we may have to use alternative methods for it. And that's where another use case for UAS is providing contested logistics of having an unmanned system bring forward MREs, bring forward water, bring forward ammunition to a place that we can't get a vehicle or a manned aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because the combatant drone knocked out your supply chains.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exactly. And having an unmanned system do contested logistics means that if it went down, all you're losing are the supplies on it. You're not losing any human life. So that's going to be, I think, really critical in future fights.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What this points me towards is, in this game of one upmanship between UAS and counter UAS, it seems that mass itself can play a big role at each iteration of that game, where, someone will choose to counter the other system by simply producing, huge scale numbers of their system. And especially as we move towards systems that have less and less human involvement. the ability to do that scale up becomes even more and more feasible. So, it points towards an inevitability, number one, of moving humans out of the loop in these systems. whether people are comfortable with it or not. One side or the other is going to go in that direction. And it also points towards something decisive in the battle being a high volume production capability to produce things throughout the war effort and not just prior to the war. Because as we're observing, these are really rapidly evolving technologies. They change throughout the conflict and thus they don't have a really long shelf life. So it really points towards cheap, high scale, immediate production capability as one of the ingredients going into this conflict that it helps either side play this type of a game.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that cheap, quick aspect of it, I think, is a challenge for our military. Because when you think cheap and good, you're going to have a really hard time finding something that's NDA compliant. Because that's going to push you more towards the drones you can buy at Walmart, right? But there's always going to be American innovation. They don't all have to be small aerial systems. We've seen some really exciting innovations coming out of the Navy's Task Force 59, where they want to run demos on a shoestring budget. And they're just using a commercial boat and they just modified it to be unmanned, an unmanned surface vessel. You have even older drones that are fielded program of records that's just a software update to push those to be fully autonomous. So we aren't limited by new purchases only. And everything doesn't have to be the quintessential small quadcopter, I think a lot of it's going to involve thinking about something from a different angle to get to that true mass that we're looking for.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It really does require new thinking because it is, in some ways at odds with the ways that we've developed and procured military hardware in recent decades, where we've opted for more lethal, more expensive systems that we perhaps possess in fewer numbers than the previous generation. And other types of munitions we've been able to stockpile over long periods of time. For instance, 155 millimeter shells, you can stockpile those for 30 years and still employ them with effectiveness in the battlefield. But if the munitions, if the expendable high scale items that you bring into the conflict have this degree of intelligence and behavior built into them, they have a shorter shelf life. And so those two factors are both changing as we look at, the lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, and as we look ahead to a future conflict. It's really bringing home the deep implications of this for what we emphasize in future procurement.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And, the Boneyard in Davies Monthan comes to mind as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For repurposing some of that. Kara, what are you hearing from defense customers? What are things that they care about the most? You mentioned the Switchblade, but can you peel that onion a couple layers and talk about the specific capabilities? Is it the robustness to jamming? Is it GPS denied navigation? Is it autonomous features?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in true DoD fashion, it's going to be, they want all of it. That's generally what I hear from the customers is they want something that has a long endurance. It can go up in the air for a while. They want something that has crystal clear ISR. They want something that can operate in a GPS denied or contested environment. And they want it really cheap. That's generally what they want. But you get to pick just a few of those characteristics. I'm also seeing a demand for things that can be passively placed as well. So systems that don't need to be handled as often and they can be, left in place for use later. I'm also seeing a demand for systems that operate off a common ground control station. And so instead of a warfighter having to have multiple apps in order to control systems, it's being able to have a more single, point of contact for controlling systems. And when you start thinking, everyone loves the word swarm. When you start thinking about swarms, it's how on earth would a single operator control multiple systems, especially if they all come from different providers, which likely they should. That's likely because you want folks that are really good at what they do. You don't want one company making every single drone on the battlefield. So we need those to all be able to work together in a single interface that the warfighter can interact with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are you talking about the, I don't know what the acronym is, RAC2 or SCI initiatives in the Army, or is it something else that you're referring to?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's just broader in the idea that even if you took it away from the DoD and you looked at something like Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol, they're using well over 10 different providers for drones at the border. And so those have to have a commonality for use, because you can't have every single officer be trained on every single type of drone, and the interface can't be completely different. So just a broader, interoperability versus a specific initiative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Kara, how do you see the status of the counter UAS capabilities in the battlefield? And what is the source for the massive attrition that we're seeing in Ukraine?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the status of the counter UAS is that we need more soldier borne options is that we can't have counter UAS that's tied to a specific location. And I think we're not seeing attrition solely from counter UAS in Ukraine. I think we're also seeing it through your other options like system failure or kinetics from the counterparts are taking them down, but for counter UAS, I think that the market's going to see a really intense focus on pushing innovation in that area, and that innovation is going to probably not get a break from that push for a while because they're going to need to keep pace with what's coming out of the UAS market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you see UAS as having the edge over counter UAS currently?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I do. I do because I think a lot of counter UAS has been focused on a small, very small drone swarm. They haven't been focusing on larger drones as often that I've seen, unless it's just not available out in the news. And so there aren't going to be as many things they can take down from a counter UAS standpoint that are going to take down like a Group 3. You're going to have to resort back to traditional military means of taking down an aircraft, which is likely going to require a cost that's multitudes higher than the cost of that airframe. And we're seeing that in Ukraine as well, where Russia's putting up systems that are, really cheap, probably wouldn't even fly five more missions after that, but it costs 50, 000 to bring it down. Because there isn't going to be a counter UAS method to bring them down, other than ammunition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If Ukraine is losing 10, 000 drones a month, how is it losing them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's going to be losing a lot of them either from counter UAS, from the adversary, or it's gonna be losing them. So one of the things that they count in that are gonna be things like loitering munitions are gonna count, but that loss is actually very intentional. It's not meant to come back. So anything that's a kamikaze drone, that will be counted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If a lot of the demand is coming from the military use of drones, where the path to market is a lot quicker, what do you think is the impact on the commercial market. And specifically here I'm thinking about creating these attritable systems with components that don't require the kind of robustness that you would want to see in a drone that's used in a commercial, use case. So if most industry resources are funneled into a world where you don't need that level of robustness, what's the impact on the commercial technology development?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So assuming that the regulatory environment catches up, it should lower the barrier to entry for commercial customers to get into UAS to replace things that they're using, maybe, even like manned systems for right now. Things like agricultural use cases, where you need a low cost way to crop dust, but you need to crop dust once a year. There probably isn't any reason that you would need a really high level system to do that. So, having the defense lead the innovation, and push industry to innovate around that attritable mass will likely make it easier for commercial customers to enter into the UAS market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right, Kara, so let's talk about the Replicator initiative. Can you describe for the audience what we know about it? What information is still missing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Replicator caught most folks, I think it's safe to say everybody, off guard when the Deputy Secretary of Defense Hicks announced it in early August, and she announced it to the press that we were going to do this initiative. And that's where she introduced the name Replicator, that was going to leverage unmanned systems to bring mass and prepare for upcoming conflicts. After that press release, there's been just a lot of confusion in industry around what does this mean exactly? What's going to be their acquisition method for doing this? Is there going to be an RFP? Where is that going to come out of? And what we know today is that a lot of the coordination for industry and government is coming through the Defense Innovation Unit or DIU, and that we have moved to the point where we believe that there's going to be tranches for Replicator. And we know that tranche one is what they're focused on first, but beyond that, we've had nothing really official from the government providing firm guidance to industry on what to expect coming forward. I think the number one thing folks aren't sure about is where the money is coming from. We know that Hicks has said that this isn't a new program. So Replicator is not a new program of record. It's an initiative. Also not clear is whether or not it's accelerating current and funded ongoing efforts by the DoD or if it's starting new. So this is one of those times where there's a lot of information trading happening in industry. There's a lot of engagement with the government and trying to put the puzzle pieces together on what this means so that we can be in a position to meet the demand if and when it comes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, tell our audience if you could just, what drove the need for Replicator and really what is it, why did, secretary Hicks feel it was so important?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Replicator is about bringing this mass into the environment. And I know that sounds really high level, but we're talking about all domain attributable autonomous systems, which has a confusing acronym. If you're familiar with other DoD acronyms like A2AD, this is ADA2, that all domain attributable autonomous systems. They've been fairly forthright saying that the reason for Replicator is to meet the growing threat of China. And that's been the motivation around it. What we've learned since then is that we aren't just talking about unmanned systems that are in the air. We're talking about unmanned surface vessels. We're talking about unmanned underwater vessels. So we're going to be covering down on all of those domains.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned tranches. What do we know about the plan to roll out the tranches, and what's Tranche One?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we know that the tranches were something that the government, they had an internal committee, and they reached out to the services and to the combatant commands and asked for recommendations on what should be included in that first tranche. We know that those recommendations were then given, We believe that they've done a vote on that. Hicks released press towards the end of last week saying that she's made her decisions and she's going to be presenting them to Congress. So, our best guess is that she'll do that in the next week or two, and then after she gets congressional approval on that plan for Tranche 1 that it will be announced and communication with industry will happen then. There hasn't been any commercial solutions openings or RFPs. There have been a few RFIs, which are requests for information and it's not binding that have come out related to Replicator, but we haven't seen anything related to tranche one come out through official government channels. It's actually all been coming through the press.

They're planning on doing what's called reprogramming funds. So that would be potentially tied to the 24 budget. So there's a lot of what I like to call business development math going around trying to figure out Tranch One. So figuring out, hey, is my company on the list? Does it say what thing that we make is on that list? Great. So we know they're going to reprogram funds and we know that the 24 budget will likely hit on x date which means the money would be available on y date so that we can inform our leadership on what our next steps are going to be. And that's what every company who is anywhere close to being on Tranche One is doing right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And are we correct to understand that most of the companies that will be on Tranche 1 are, companies that are on an existing program of record with DoD?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'd actually, nobody knows for sure. The idea is that they're all currently engaged with the DoD. They may not be engaged in a program of record though. So I think it would be unlikely that it's going to be any companies that are not currently doing business with the Department of Defense. But I haven't heard anything that's going to limit it to current program of record.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you are a betting person, who are the top five firms that you're would say are gonna be part of the program?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would say, Aeroenvironment, Anduril and then I would have to Google some unmanned surface vessel and unmanned undersea vessel company names, because I don't even know there're any. And I would pick, three of those, and that's what I would include.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, given you mentioned AeroVironment. why are you so confident and what would be their role do you think?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think I'm so confident because I know how pivotal the Switchblade 600's been in Ukraine.

And is it all Group 1 and Group 2 vehicles? Is there any intuition about the kinds of capabilities or the types of vehicles, at least in the air domain?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think in the air domain, that focus is going to be on, just to go back to that all domain, attritable autonomy. So what's going to be able to be autonomous in that all domain. And when I think all domain, I'm really thinking about back to that Pacific theater. So what's going to work when GPS doesn't, what's going to work when you're in the water, what's going to work when it's been days and you haven't been activated yet. So there haven't been any formal requirements for Replicator released to industry. So a lot of it's going to be around the press that was released and some of the industry events that have happened. The DIU is going to do a Replicator industry summit either this month or next, they haven't announced it yet. At that point, the hope is that some of those requirements will be released to industry. What we've been told is that Tranche 1 is going to be a way for them to experiment and learn on how Replicator should be. Because in the name itself, there should be a process that is able to be replicated. We aren't just producing systems for the sake of it. We've done that before. that's not too innovative. This is more about the DoD itself having a process that it can replicate on how it can step outside of its traditional acquisition boundaries and achieve mass when needed and creating that replicated process they can pass on as needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We talked earlier about the industry's lack of certainty about forecasting demand and therefore investing in manufacturing and technology. Has Replicator changed that a little bit or to what extent has it, how has the industry responded back in August versus in the months that followed?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have seen some press from some drone startups saying that they're opening new manufacturing facilities to be better positioned for Replicator. But for most of the industry, we're in a wait and see. We need to get the requirements. We need to get the timing. And we need to get the actual order from the government that's what we need to be prepared. But that's just basic economics, right? Where any company isn't going to produce more of something until they're sure that it's been ordered.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interesting. I mean, just looking at the macro. Situation and the direction that the world is headed towards. it does look like it'll be increased instability. And the need for production capability and fielding of these autonomous attritable systems is only going to grow in importance. So, I get the argument of not investing without firm orders, but there's a balance to that. At some point you have to be investing so that you stay relevant and so that you stay ahead of this wave that you can respond to in short notice. How do the major players in the industry think about this balance? How do you think about it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that balance is one of those checkpoints that at an established industry, you're checking in constantly on the forecast. You're checking in on how things are looking month to month. Because you want to be able to ramp up manufacturing, but you also have to maintain quality. So you're balancing a lot of factors when you're looking at it. And most of the established defense industrial base, they are manufacturing at a fairly high level already. They are pushing out what's needed. And it is always the question of, well, what if that quadrupled? What would you do then? And the answer is, new manufacturing facilities, hiring additional people, and all of that takes time, especially when you're talking about manufacturing things like munitions. You can't just, throw that together in a couple weeks and get it going. There's a lot of regulations and certifications that need to happen before that can get going. I think that it's possible we may see some government investment in the manufacturing capability for weapon systems from the government, similar to the, CHIPS Act that came out. But if you look at the CHIPS Act, it takes a lot of time for that to flow down to the industry as well. So I think it's one of those we need to just prepare for.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You said the defense industrial complex is supplying at the demanded rate so far, or say that again so I make sure I have that right. And my question that's tied to it is, how do you think about that in the context of the current order backlogs for existing missile systems, which we're reading about in the press right now? But please say that again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I think the defense industrial base in general is producing at the quantity as required by their contracts. So a lot of that demand signal is going to come from their contractual requirements. Things like lead times, they're usually built into the expectations in their contract, and so Peter, you brought up missile system delays, there will be times where they're going to be untenable delays and delivery. And the more complex the system you're delivering, the more likely you're probably going to hit some of those. But for your smaller group one UAS, you're likely not going to hit those kind of delays. And so those are going to be able to be produced relatively easily, as needed, depending on that demand signal and contractual requirements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you think that there's a logical conclusion that comes out of this? That, some of the future systems that get designed, the people designing them will put certain constraints on it that avoid very complex handbuilt components or exotic materials that, by avoiding those, would allow them to ramp production rapidly in the event of a big change in demand due to a conflict. Is that something that's being discussed that's being pursued as a theory now or not?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think I see that trend in industry. I'm seeing the trend to move away from the exquisite. But I'm not seeing that demand signal in government solicitation documents. And that's really where it ultimately needs to come from. Because if the exquisite one off system is what wins, that's what industry will, create. Because there's going to be payoffs for using commercially available parts. And those payoffs will likely come in performance. And so the end user has to accept that, where if you want something, let's say you need a solar powered high altitude drone, if you're willing to accept that solar, high altitude drone has commercial solar panels that were not, designed and engineered for that drone, what you're likely doing is you have less payload. Or you've had to change the design in a way to account for the commercial solar panels. So if the end users and the customers, if they accept those trade offs, you're going to see even more of it in industry because it's what makes sense. And it's what allows us to have shorter lead times. There's nobody in U.S. industry who wants to tell a customer that it's going to take 180 days to send you what you ordered.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>54:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, that ability to rapidly ramp up production might become one of the requirements of the system design.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. But I think even more so than saying rapidly ramp up production, because you're always going to have companies that are going to put their finger in the air and say, well, what about additive manufacturing to create my exquisite part that I developed for this one particular air system? You actually will likely need to see a more explicit emphasis on using commercially sourced parts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara what do you think is the advantage of startups in this environment, especially with respect to those kinds of entities being more long term looking in terms of capital allocation and planning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think startups have a huge role to play in this because startups bring a couple advantages. The first being focus. A good startup is focused on a particular subset of a problem, and large companies, they're never going to be focused on one small piece of anything. They're focused on a whole family of systems, a family of products. So startups can bring that focus, but they're also going to bring investment, which gives them freedom to experiment. And you're going to get a lot of innovation from that, that is going to bring advantage to this challenge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>56:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if you had an audience of innovators, well, actually, you do have an audience of innovators, you said, listen, this is a great environment for startups. And these are the three things I would focus on. What would they be?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>56:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the three things I would focus on if I was in a startup right now would be Underwater Unmanned Vehicles, Surface Unmanned Vehicles, and whatever is the next generation of counter UAS. There's a huge proliferation of companies that do USVs and UUVs. In my viewpoint, and maybe folks can send me emails and tell me I'm wrong later, which I'd love to hear, there isn't a clear leader. There's no Anduril or Palantir of USVs at this point. And there needs to be one. There needs to be that company that's not just pushing the envelope, but leading the pack. And for counter UAS, you have some of the larger defense startups like Epirus that have a really exciting product. But, like all good startups, they've been really focused on one subsection of it, and there's a lot of space left that needs that American startup innovation concentrated focus.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that's a pretty good size industry. If I remember correctly, it's today, maybe a couple billion, but it's supposed to go to 10 plus billion in the next couple of years. So it's a good size, realizable market for a startup to get involved with. And you're saying it's not a crowded space, counter UAS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it is, but I think there's not a lot of sticky in that space. Because if you had to name a company that is in counter UAS, I would challenge you to name one off the top of your head that wasn't Epirus so I think that there's a lot of room left to rise above the level that folks are at now, and proving out maybe a different way of thinking about counter UAS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think there have been a lot of attempts in Counter UAS, but the results have been, middling. It feels like there, there really is a fundamental breakthrough and approach that's required to give Counter UAS the upper hand over UAS, and we're still looking for that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I believe that it'll come out of the startup community when it does arrive.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, where do you think the innovation is needed more in counter UAS, on the detection piece or the mitigation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mitigation and also the delivery of that mitigation. So, another Catch 22 is that the best way to deliver a kind of UAS payload would be by UAS. And so, how are you going to get the mitigation to the time and place of need because you may not have the range to do it from the ground.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interesting. Back to the Replicator, why do you think the announcement was done in a way that it was, with such levels of ambiguity?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I can tell you that, my joke is that it's the whole thing is a psychological operation, either against our own defense industrial base or against the Chinese. We're all going to spend a lot of calories trying to figure out what's going on. But it was probably something as simple as, sometimes in bureaucracies, the only way to get something done is to say it publicly. And so it may be a way of making innovation happen is by forcing it by telling the press we're going to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a very interesting theory. So if it was the former, what is it about the existing military industrial base that needs to be shaken up?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think shaking up on the idea of a low cost system is that an announcement like Replicator makes even the most established large businesses think about, how can I make it cheaper? Let's go back to the CAD designs. Let's really think through what can we drop? What can we modify? How cheap could we make this? Because they want to be ready to talk to the government about how they could meet the mission. And so it is a forcing mechanism where, in general, you are not trying to think about how to rip out everything out of your system to make it as cheap as possible is not a common thought exercise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if that is the end goal, and especially if this is the end goal for the 18 to 24 month timeframe as initially communicated, what's on the critical path to achieving this in terms of technology or processes or anything else for that matter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In all honesty, the biggest piece on the critical path is gonna be clear announcements and communication with industry so that industry can start working to meet the intent of what we're doing with the Tranche One of Replicator. And then also clarity on what the Tranche Two and Tranche Three however high those numbers go. It's what's the vision there? Because sometimes if it's something that's going to maybe push the envelope further than we're doing right now, R&amp; D doesn't happen overnight. And industry has the capacity to invest in it, but you need a heads up, you need to be that trusted mission partner and sit shoulder to shoulder with the government and see what they're trying to achieve, what's the overall concept of operations that we're doing here, and that's going to be the critical path. The more that's shown to industry, the more that we'll be prepared to meet the challenge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so let's say that, the industry day for the Replicator happens this month and there is clarity in the volumes and let's say the DoD decides that we want to be able to manufacture in 24 months from now, tens of thousands of group one and group two UAS systems. Is that realistic? What is the realistic path of achieving that goal look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I don't know if tens of thousands is realistic, but hundreds or even low thousands is absolutely realistic. And once that's clear, the individual industry partners will make a plan and start working to make sure that either investments need to be made, a reprioritization of resources needs to happen. And we'll all start marching towards the goal of being able to do that. I think right now, when we're in that ambiguity and haze of not being entirely sure, I think this is probably the hardest part. This phase, I think, is going to be harder than actually delivering on the goals. Because we aren't able to do anything with the amount of information we have right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So do you see a need for innovation and entirely new technology development that needs to be executed on in order to be able to ramp up to these levels? And I'm thinking novel manufacturing processes, cheaper infrastructure, or perhaps, certain elements of the supply chain of the industrial base that requires new R&amp; D, new technology development, or is it a matter of just having a line of sight to capital and scaling whatever existing technology?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think innovation is absolutely going to be required for the later tranches. What we've heard about Tranche One is that it's going to be about systems that are already in production, or are about to be in production. So the anticipation there isn't that we'll need to change anything about what we're making. It's more about being ready to make more of them. But for the later tranches, innovation is absolutely, I think, going to be required. And even for the current first tranche, there's a lot of room for innovation around how things are manufactured, how supply chains work, and how supply chains are also managed. Because a big part of being able to supply mass is also maintaining mass. And so we'll need to look to innovation to be able to do that better than, is currently done.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's your intuition about tranche 2? What will that look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My intuition is that it will likely focus on what I like to refer to as enablers. So when you, when you start thinking through having, let's say 3000 drones, then you start to wonder, okay, I just delivered these to fill in the blank Army customer. Now, how are they going to actually employ that mass? How are they going to, train for it? How are they going to do the command and control for it when they're actually using it? And a lot of those are going to come from what I call enablers. And so you're going to see things that are less attritable, but maybe still autonomous that work in concert with the mass to enable the mission to actually happen. That's my gut for Tranche 2. It may be a later Tranche than that. And I also think, contested logistics is going to be a focus of one of the Tranches as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, yeah. Before we wrap up with the podcast, I wanted to ask a quick question. I mean, at the end of the day, a lot of innovation comes on the commercial side because of defense spending. Let's say we implement Replicator in the next year or so. What major change on the commercial side will occur because of Replicator?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the major change we're going to see is probably a rethinking of economy of scale pricing from our commercial partners. I think that a lot of economy of scale pricing for commercial components is on the idea that those really large scale orders come in very few and far between, and I'm not sure that their profit margins are going to hold when they start getting multiple orders at the high end of those economy scales. So I think we may see some pricing innovations come out of the commercial sector. And I think we may also see what I have mentally been referring to is like Kirkland brand options for drone components. Just like you can go to Costco and you can get your Kirkland brand for fill in the blank. I think we may start seeing that in the drone industry as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, arguably it'll drive prices down. The US commercial drone companies, will they be negatively affected by this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that until those Kirkland brand options are available, there may be some scarcity in the market, or there may be a difficulty at meeting your price objective given to you by the government. But eventually, where there is demand there's gonna be market\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Arguably at a lower price because of the\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>for the volume\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>driving down costs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in line with that, do you see the evolution of some kind of mil spec drones being designed and then bid out to different manufacturers to produce at scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that's the only way you would be able to achieve the kind of mass we're talking about and then sustain it. If you weren't able to have large manufacturing plants or gigafactories that were producing drones at scale for multiple providers, It's hard to imagine how you're gonna meet that demand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's interesting.

I mean, is it going to be some of the big commercial drone companies? OEMs?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think it will be with the big commercial drone OEMs, and I think it's gonna be some of the defense tech startups as well.

And we're looking at this proliferation of options available that will be at a much different price point than what we've seen and able to operate with a higher degree of autonomy than we've seen in the past. And I think for Counter UAS, we'll see a rise in optionality in that market for how we can counter these systems and secure key places like our bases in forward locations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:09:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about even longer term, 10 years?

And that it's not an area where we have pure dominance. Ukraine has definitely shown us that there are systems that are coming out of other countries that are performing really well on the battlefield and are giving Ukraine an edge and they're cheaper and they have a great deal of capability. So I think one of the things that's important to keep in mind is that we aren't the only game out there for this and that's a good thing to keep in mind because it keeps you sharp and it keeps you focused on making our capabilities even better.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Great point.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, I gotta tell you, I am so impressed with how you've handled these questions and you get to the point, you're brief, and you're so knowledgeable.

Welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Robert Rose co-founder and CEO of Reliable Robotics. Listen, few have Robert's pedigree to create systems for autonomous aircraft with his work and leadership at Reliable Robotics, as well as from his position as Director of Flight Software at Space X and at Tesla, where they worked on bringing to market the first consumer automobile with fully unassisted self-driving capability. This is a conversation about autonomy. We discussed the arc of automation and what evolved in the conversation, the arc of safety in aviation from its early days to today. You'll notice how Robert will closely and consistently link autonomy to safety in the beginning, throughout and at the end of the conversation; an irrefutable argument. He essentially says autonomy is going to happen so get used to it. But he makes the hard medicine taste just a bit better by tying the key arguments to safety. We spend a bit of time on the motivation for pursuing autonomous flight by segment GA part 1 35, 1 21 with a safety imperative with automation being more required in the former than in the latter. After a few attempts, we eventually get to other reasons why autonomy is needed in addition to, and beyond the safety case. As we've discussed many times the podcasts, we discussed the need for autonomy for many of the advanced air mobility business models to scale, and to meet their financial projections. Robert discusses the autonomous capabilities of Reliable Robotics, and as Robert says, what makes them unique is their ground up designs for automation and certification, where it's more difficult for others to go back and design for automation if that wasn't the original intention. We spent a lot of time discussing the processes required to certify automation systems. And you'll notice that we make every attempt to quantify the addressable market for autonomy and for Reliable Robotics at each of its stages today and in the future. Robert deftly steers the path to the size of the overall aviation market. We try to stay focused on the addressable market in the next five years and what opportunities within Reliable Robotics are tied exclusively to the Caravan and how easy it is to transition the capabilities to other aircraft. Next is a really interesting discussion around the design of their air to air radar it's value, market size, and why build it on their own versus purchasing off the shelf radar and whether or not it's core to their autonomy focus or perhaps a distraction to that focus. This naturally leads to a discussion around their airspace integration solution, including capabilities from their own radar and integrating data from other sources and the dependency on those solutions. And a discussion around the availability and value of primary radar data, where some would say, including me, it's availability is a lot further away than most people think especially given justifiably how long it took to release secondary radar data to industry. Listen to what Robert says is his biggest upcoming challenges if he had to pick one. He wraps up his talk with great advice to entrepreneurs. Robert, thanks for joining us and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Robert Rose as you innovate in The Vertical Space. Robert's deep engineering experience spans over 20 years across aerospace, self-driving cars and robotics. Prior to co-founding Reliable Robotics, in his role as Director of Flight Software at SpaceX, Robert was responsible for flight, ground, simulation and data management software successfully launching and operating the first 10 Falcon 9 rockets, 5 Dragon spacecraft, and Grasshopper VT VL tests. He led the development of the onboards flight software for their first commercial mission to the international space station, for which he received special recognition from NASA. At Tesla, Robert brought to market the first consumer automobile with fully unassisted self-driving capability. He led the team through developing novel computer vision, human machine interfaces and control technologies resulting in the successful deployment of the autopilot 1.0 and the 7.0 version of Tesla's instrument panel. At Google X, Robert led a development team on a secret project combining AI techniques with practical robotic systems to bring advanced machine perception and manipulation technologies to large vehicles. Earlier in his career, Robert contributed to three\"Game of the Year\" award winning titles during his time at Sony PlayStation and worked at HP as a software engineer. Robert is a presidentially invited Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Robert holds multiple patents, a BS in Computer Science, a BS in Computer Engineering and an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Oregon State University. Robert, welcome to The Vertical Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, great to be here. Thank you for having me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First question, is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's a couple of different ways I could take this. I could take this, the, are you asking, Robert the individual or Robert the company? let me take the, company perspective. we started Reliable Robotics because we felt that somebody needed to cut a different path from everybody else in, in the UAM, AAM, RAM, new aviation space. We felt very strongly that somebody needed to focus specifically on autonomy and autonomy in the United States, because at the time, and I think this is still true today, I still hear from folks, people say, well, well, this is never going to happen. We're never going to have autonomous aircraft or this is never going to happen in the United States. It's going to happen in Dubai or New Zealand or Brazil or someplace like that first. Or people say, well, nobody, even if we have autonomy, nobody's going to buy it. Customers aren't going to want it. Pilots will never allow it. Passengers will never accept it. And I feel that a lot of these criticisms are still true to some extent today, or at least many people still hold these, and bring up these criticisms. We obviously, I obviously feel quite different. I believe this will happen. It will happen very soon. It will happen in the United States. I believe there is a path to bring this technology forward that, pilots and other stakeholders in aviation will accept. And we can talk more about that later. And I think ultimately we'll get to a place where passengers are going to accept it. this is the future. I think the near future is going to have orders of magnitude more aircraft in the sky, and the way that we get there is with greater levels of autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>when you say it's here, it's going to happen. and people are going to accept it. So what level of automation are you describing when you say it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm referring to automated aircraft that enable you to take the pilot out of the plane and into a control center, place them into a control center. This requires an aircraft that's capable of fully automated taxi, takeoff, and landing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now you mentioned, you have, you had a professional response to those who, don't always agree with you on something. And then you said you had a personal as well. So what's the personal?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I want aviation to be safer. I'm a pilot and I think there's a lot of people that get into aviation because they have that love of, grabbing the controls and, they are the airplane, be the airplane. And there's a part of me that I get that, I understand the appeal. I think, unlike many that get into aviation, I also appreciate it for what it enables you to do and where it enables you to go. And I value the where you can go with aviation more than the experience of aviation, if that makes any sense. And for me, I want more automation in the cockpit. to ensure my safety, the safety of my family and others that I take in the plane with me. I've had several occasions in my limited experience flying where I've gotten myself into trouble and I wish there was a land now button in the aircraft. I think there should be a land now button in all airplanes. not just a system that's certified for emergency use only, but a normal use Autoland gets you back into a safe configuration and on the ground. and we have aspects of this today in airplanes. we've got wings levelers and emergency autoland and autopilots that can do heading changes and capture an approach and do all of that, but I don't think that goes far enough. I think there's a lot more that we can do to make aircraft safer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, before we get into, the meat of the discussion, you used the word safety now, 15 times in a couple of minutes,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>two or three, exactly two or three\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you for noticing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>two or three years ago, would safety have been mentioned as much as the use case for automation or what was your value proposition a couple of years ago for automation and fully autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I feel like we've been consistent on this from the beginning. Now, I think the larger conversation this industry has been having has been shifting. And I think that's because folks or others are recognizing that, the way you get the FAA and larger customers excited about this technology is you do that through safety by improving safety. I don't know if that answers your question. is that what you're getting at?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, there's a piece of me that says, well, you can't argue with safety. although I question whether people will pay for safety, you can't argue with safety. But yes, the many people listening right now will think, oh, we're going to talk about automation, we're going to talk about fully autonomous flight, we're going to talk about the economic value, we're going to talk about pilotless flights, which is extraordinarily controversial. But in some ways, you've steered a path here that is not controversial. Who can argue with safety? And you're saying that's a deliberate act for a variety of reasons.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, if you look at what stakeholders in the aviation industry care about, safety is the first thing that they talk about. If you look at, well just step back and look at the history of technology advancements we've had in airplanes over the last a hundred plus years. why has anything in an aircraft changed? It's changed to make the airplane safer. Like that's not an accident. I actually would be interested in knowing about improvements that were made strictly for economic reasons. Okay, maybe winglets come to mind. But most technologies, or at least electronic, avionic technologies, are there to prevent accidents and save lives. Period. And I think autonomy fits within that same trajectory. Autonomy or autonomous aircraft. It is just, it is an incremental set of enhancements on top of the incremental enhancements we've been making over the last several decades. I don't see the advanced navigation system that we're developing a whole lot different than what has been done in previous years with GPS, ILS, and other radio navigation systems, and even going all the way back to light beacon navigation systems. these are all technology enhancements to help improve safety. the automated landing system that we developed, I think, fits within that same trajectory of, automated landing systems and automated approach systems that have been developed to date. Our automated take off system, which is really a take off rejection system, fits largely within what's been happening in the industry for, for decades on automated monitoring of aircraft configuration during take off and take off rejection systems, And finally, automated taxiing, I see that, as a bit more new and novel, but from a core technology standpoint, really just builds on systems that are already going into aircraft. and even now, it's, our automated taxi system, I would say, builds on taxi planning features that you have in an EFB now, and it's just taking that one tiny step further, to ultimately improve the safety of you, the pilot, the occupants of the aircraft, and the people that operate around that aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm sure a lot in our audience all have, pretty good familiarity with aviation history and the milestones that were achieved over the last century. But from your perspective and from the perspective of what you're building at Reliable, What are the key milestones along that arc in terms of putting in place the building blocks and setting the precedence for autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, we, and you're referring here specifically to the history of aviation. what are key milestones throughout the last century?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, Full Authority Digital Engine Control. Huge. I think we need FADECs in every plane. I think it's ridiculous that small aircraft, expect you to sit there and manage mixture and, prop speed and all of those other components. it, it should just be, fully automatic. At the very least, we should have auto throttles in every plane. Instrument landing system goes back to the 40s. I believe the first experiments were in the 40s with automated landing systems, and then that technology was further developed in the 50s, and then commercialized first in the 60s. I think it was the, I think it was the Trident, I think it was British Airways, I could be wrong, that first deployed that technology, and that drove, developments in fault tolerant computing, I think, is something we take for granted because the space race was occurring around the same time, but the first real commercialization of a fault tolerant computing system was an Autoland system. This goes back to the 60s. NASA in the 70s built, I can't recall the acronym, I just remember that it wasn't the best choice for an acronym, but they built a, oh, it was the Terminally Configured Aircraft Program. they built a flight management system that allowed you to specify a flight path through all phases of flight, takeoff, enroute, and all the way to landing. And they actually flew this, it was on a Boeing aircraft. I can't recall exactly which model. GPS also stands out as another huge safety benefit. switching from, ILS approaches, which require expensive, infrastructure to be installed at the airport and then maintained. By the way, the FAA has a small army of pilots that just do nothing but fly around the country to monitor approaches and to make sure all the radio signals are correct. Moving away from that and towards a satellite constellation system has gone a long way to improve safety because it's enabled so many more airports to have RNAV approaches. That's huge! Think about all the accidents that we had before from people messing up approaches and going visual before they should have, or scud running. a lot of that has gone away. It's gone a huge way to improve safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>let's stay on the history of flight. Talk about the arc of automation and aviation from the early days.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we go all the way back to the Sperry autopilot, would be the start of it. I believe those tests were done first in the 30s, and then instrument landing system, as I mentioned, fault tolerant computing associated with that developed in the 60s. I think other key moments, key inflection points would be, Automated descent systems that monitor depressurization events, and then will bring an aircraft back down, to a safe altitude. I don't want to get too dark, but there have been some accidents recently where if that technology had been in those Private aircraft, it would have saved lives, but it does exist in a few large, commercial aircraft. there's a GA Avionics manufacturer that, promotes this as a product. I don't know off the top of my head how many aircraft have actually adopted this system, but, That, I think, is huge. for us, that's very significant because, automated descent following a depressurization event, you've got there a system that at very high integrity is monitoring for an adverse condition or an anomalous condition in the aircraft. And without asking the pilot, it's taking over the plane and putting the plane into a safe configuration. It's descending down to a safe altitude to save the lives of everybody that's on board the aircraft. And we talk about, that as like a key inflection point internally, because that's a time when you've got, an automated system taking over from a human, and in a split second manner, acting to take control of the aircraft. and you can't find a straight line between that technology and the regulations. the closest regulation being 91. 3, the pilot is the ultimate authority for the safe operation of the aircraft. here you've got the automation taking that responsibility, and that's significant precedence for us. and a lot of the system that we're developing now leverages on that precedence, or builds upon that precedence, I should say.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, as we pursue, autonomous flight. Let's talk about the motivation for, this goal and let's do it on a segment by segment basis. So describe for each of the, part 121 operations or 135 or general aviation or UAS systems for that matter. Why do each of those segments really care about fully autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, so GA, 121, 135, and then you had UAS, which I assume you're referring to small UAS\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>correct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>okay, sub 55 pounds. The Box Droppers, as we affectionately call them. GA, I think, has a clear need to improve safety. there's this myth that is commonly propagated that aviation is the safest mode of transportation. And that's true for certain 121 operations. That's definitely not true for GA. And there's a couple of papers that were published in the last several years that dug into the data here and concluded that, flying small aircraft, and this is GA, and certain 135 operations is actually 8 to 15 times more dangerous than driving on a per mile basis. I found this shocking. my intuition was planes are probably not safer than driving smaller planes. I didn't know it was this much worse. and so there, the motivation is to improve safety. That then ties to a very clear economic or business imperative. if you talk to almost any small airplane manufacturer, they will tell you that the biggest impediment to them selling more aircraft is the significant other. I don't want you getting in that thing, or I'm not getting in that thing with you. And systems like, parachutes and whatnot have gone a long way to alleviate some of those concerns, but not all of them. My strong belief is higher levels of automation are going to improve safety and thus expand general aviation to even more people, which I think is very exciting. I know my significant other, my wife, would be very excited about this and much more comfortable flying with me if she knew that we had a land now button.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I agree. General aviation does have a much more pronounced safety problem, but what about part 121 operations and 135?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll take 135 next. I'll take these in, in order from smallest to biggest. So in 135 operations, you also have a safety imperative. Here you've got, aircraft that are frequently operated single pilot, frequently operated at lower altitudes in, More adverse weather conditions than what you would see in 121 operations. And the nature of the work, tends to be a little bit less, What's the word I'm looking for? A little bit less structured than what in 1 2 1 operations. safety management systems, for example, are not required of all 1 3 5 operations. They should be, but they're not. small 135 operations don't have the FAA requirement. certain operators impose. They voluntarily adopt SMS. I think that's great. more operations should do that. But there, I don't want to get dark again and start citing specific accidents, but if you Google around, 135 accidents, especially 135 cargo accidents, you'll see some very unfortunate events where, People have gotten themselves into some pretty sticky situations that could have been prevented with automation. so there's a safety imperative there. The business, motivation in 135 is a bit different. I'm going to say pilot shortage. that shouldn't be shocking to anybody, but the pilot shortage in the 121 realm is trickling down to the 135 realm, and it is vacuuming up pilots out of 135 operations at a very fast rate. I hear from operators quite frequently that turnover is extremely high. it's getting harder to recruit and retain people. Salaries are skyrocketing. And on top of all of this, because of the accidents we were talking about earlier, insurance and training and other factors are all becoming more expensive, so it's becoming harder to find people to run these operations. For some operators that I've spoken with, it's existential. They say that they may not be able to run their operation in the near future because of pilots, and so they need to look at automation. they need to look at ways they can, Get more people, trained up, which you can do with improved levels of automation, or move to remote piloting as our technology is moving. so finally, in the 121 realm, you've got some different dynamics. pilot shortage is definitely a topic of conversation, but, I think safety, it's not talked about that much publicly, but Congress has been bringing it up as of late. we've had a few incidents that have occurred at major U. S. airports that made headlines that could have been prevented with certified alerting and guidance and higher levels of automation. And I think the industry needs that to be able to keep operations efficiently flowing and to maintain public confidence in the aviation system. I don't think you can draw a straight line between pilot shortage and automation. I'm not ready to go there. I think some folks in the industry are trying to draw a straight line, but I think it's going to be several more years before, the pilot shortage is a direct driver of automation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>can you go a layer deeper, either in the Part 135 safety cases that you reference or Part 121, and give the audience some examples of a dangerous situation that occurred and the cause of it and how automation would have prevented it because obviously in aviation there are many different causes that lead to an accident. Some of them can be weather related, some of them can be, a failure of some part of the aircraft, or it can be a failure of communications. help us connect the dots between how automation specifically would alleviate certain types of accidents.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, I'll have to go back further because I I don't like to talk about recent accidents until the NTSB has completed their reports. I don't think it's appropriate to draw conclusions. but there was an accident about, a year ago involving, a Caravan pilot where, this hits pretty close to home for us, where they were attempting a, a landing, at an airport in northwestern United States, and the weather was pretty close to minimums, and they came down, broke out, and, were not able to make contact with, the runway, or they didn't break out, they weren't able to make contact with the runway, visual contact, they performed a go around, and it appears from the preliminary reports that I've read that, They decided then to descend, believing they understood the airport environment, broke out, and then, ran into some fixed infrastructure on the ground. And, this breaks my heart because, there's just no reason they needed to die. If they'd had a system that enabled, Zero Visibility Autoland, if they had a high precision navigation system that gave them a glide slope and localizer that they could track, then they could have shot this all the way down to the ground through the clouds and missed that fixed infrastructure. Some have speculated that it was a poorly designed, approach procedure, and the runway and that fixed infrastructure never should have allowed an automated approach, but, there's ways to do it. could have had a slightly higher glide slope, and we could have given this person something that would have saved their life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>as tragic as it is, it's not a case for adopting a remotely controlled aircraft though, right? How do you draw a line from that to remote control of aircraft as being the answer, as opposed to other safety enhancing, tools and systems on the aircraft from, navigation, better situational awareness, et cetera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the first system that we're developing is a fully automated aircraft that still has a pilot on board. our first step is not remote piloting. our first step is give the people in the cockpit, more sophisticated tools to prevent them from getting in those situations. And that does lead eventually to remote piloting, but there's a lot of other technologies that have to be added to the aircraft in order to enable remote piloting, such as air to air radar and more robust, communication systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you talk to your customers, part 135 mostly, I assume, do they admit that they have a safety problem? Is that what the business case revolves around?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's a substantial component, and for the reasons I mentioned earlier, there's, it comes first from a genuine desire to not put people at, a higher level of risk than necessary. If we can do something to prevent accidents and save lives, then damn it, that's what we need to do. and the customers that we talk to, the customers we spend a lot of time with, that's what they say. This is about saving lives. Having said that, there are other benefits that come along with it, once you move to remote piloting. I mentioned earlier, training, training becomes much simpler, much more straightforward. being able to reposition aircraft becomes much more straightforward. Being able to up gauge and down gauge the aircraft, flying aircraft that is appropriate for the mission or right sized for the mission is another benefit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>tell us how your concept for remote operations, how that is fundamentally different to how the military is operating its MQ 1s, MQ 9s, or for that matter the QF aircraft series.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>our system is more like Global Hawk than the old Predator system. we don't have a joystick. there's no rudder pedals. there's no live stream video feed that lets you hand fly the plane down to the ground. our system Works, very much like an FMS, because it is an FMS that we've modified, and in fact, the first system that we're certifying, the system with the pilot in the plane, they're programming the aircraft through our flight management system. It's a slightly more, sophisticated flight plan than what you would do today. Today, you would go into a plane and you would program your enroute portion. maybe you would program your departure procedure and your approach procedure. But if you did those things, there would be potentially discontinuities in your flight path. And maybe your FMS will alert you to those discontinuities. A few systems actually do that. Many will just be happy to let you fly off, out over the ocean and never actually intersect your approach. And then while flying, air traffic control, and for other reasons, you may need to change altitudes, you may need to change headings, and that deviation from the flight plan is not managed by your FMS. So our FMS manages all of that for you, so you don't need to ever Disconnect the autopilot and hand fly the aircraft, we do it all. And we do that at a level of safety that far exceeds autopilots today. So our system on the ground now uses that exact same FMS. you're programming the aircraft, just like you would if you were in the plane using our system. What else is new? You also have a Traffic awareness, feature that's built in. So on top of our moving map, we plot traffic and our system provides certified or will one day be certified, today it's certifiable alerting and guidance, that maintains safe separation from other aircraft and will modify your flight plan for you. it also enables, voice communication to the aircraft. So there's a headset connected to our system and it works just like it does today. You dial in the frequency that you want to talk on. There's a push to talk button and your voice is streamed over satellite to the aircraft and then broadcast out the aircraft. So surrounding air traffic control, they hear you. Just the same way they would if you were sitting inside the plane. And conversely, you also hear everything just as if you were inside the plane. So we did it this way because, we're trying to do the simplest thing possible that can integrate into the existing airspace system. And I emphasize this because there's Folks out there that talk about, digitization of air traffic control, I think that's exciting. We're part of an RTCA group that's working on that, but I think that's a very long ways away. today The airspace works through charts, sectionals, AFDs, and people talking to people over amplitude modulated VHF. And so if you want to integrate UAS, that's the way you've got to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Robert, given that there's so much experience across the General Atomics platforms, the Northrop Grumman's and some of the others. if there was a solid business case in the commercial market, Wouldn't you expect those same players to service part 135 operators?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know how much of this is public. so I'll speak in generalities, but major military drone manufacturer you've heard of, I know, has attempted to market, the system to commercial players and has attempted to push, their aircraft through an FAA certification process. And I, I think the short story there is, it's hard. it is really hard to take something that was not designed with certification in mind and modify it to be certifiable. the Certification process, and not just the certification process, but the set of standards that the FAA has recognized, that should be used for certification, take your systems engineering all the way back to requirements. and if you don't have the evidence going all the way back to the very, very early days, mapping the requirements for your system and why everything is exactly the way it is and precisely how you have tested everything to ensure that it meets those requirements, it's hard to go back and do that after the fact, and for those that are listening that are familiar with DO 178 software, there's common stories in there about how you can't just take something from a prototype and then snap your fingers and make it certifiable software. It just doesn't work that way. So it's hard for these military manufacturers to make that transition. millions of flight hours does not a certification case make. You need to be able to hit factors of safety in the 10 to the minus 8, 10 to the minus 9 realm. That means the acceptable failure rate is, depending upon the size of aircraft, one in a hundred million hours of flight, or one in a billion hours of flight. You can't fly a plane for a billion hours and say, well, we only had one accident, therefore, it's certifiable. I'm not smart enough, but there's a RAND paper that goes into this too, that says that even a billion hours isn't sufficient to show one in a billion. You got to go way beyond that in order to get any kind of statistical\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, right. I guess where I'm going, Robert, is when we look at the Enabling technology blocks that exist on these platforms. And there's been some recent examples where, one of these big OEMs, have integrated into civilian airspace in the UK, they do have a certifiable platform. So what's different in your system approach? On a fundamental technology block that stands in contrast to the approaches that you're seeing by these and other players,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so you used a phrase there, fundamental technology block. And maybe I'll disappoint your listeners a little bit that I don't feel there's anything fundamentally different about what Reliable Robotics is doing from a technology perspective. What we're doing that's very different is our systems engineering approach. We are looking at this from day one with certification in mind, which means a thorough understanding of the regulatory construct for Highly automated aircraft and charting a path through the regulations, through existing published guidance by the FAA. Well, by the FAA, I was going to say and others, but we are nearly exclusively focused on the United States and building a system that complies with That set of regulations and guidance from day one. I think that's what makes us different. And when you approach it from that perspective, it leads you to make different technology decisions. for example, our air to air radar is not a military target tracking radar that consumes a tremendous amount of power, takes up a bunch of space and costs I don't know how much to manufacture. It's going to cost a lot less. it's going to meet exactly the requirements the FAA has, Published that they will accept for air to air radar for detect and avoid, through TSO C 211, 212, I believe, and nothing more. and that's going to result in a system that complies with those requirements right out of the gate and is probably an order of magnitude or more, less expensive than the systems that have been developed for military applications. I would also say the same on our communication system, our ground control station. Human factors is probably the biggest area in the FAA certification process where subjectivity creeps in, and that's where there are fewer standards to leverage, and what you really ultimately need to do is convince a number of subject matter experts in the FAA that the system does not Impose an undue burden on the pilot, and is consistent with human factors best practices, which change year to year, month to month, day to day. And that, that also needs to be designed from day one with a civilian aviation use case in mind. and that's where it's probably not a custom user interface that's point and click. it probably looks a lot more like the user interfaces that the FAA has accepted to date. and that's why our, design decisions track more towards a classic FMS and not something completely new.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so whenever somebody makes a safety argument, the bar is really high, obviously. So how can, anyone pursuing autonomous flight Reliable Robotics included, make a convincing case that what you are developing is safe in every conceivable condition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, this just goes back to what we were just talking about. The way you show a system is safe is you follow the published guidance, that the FAA and EASA have long accepted. There are standards. There are system engineering process standards that have been around for many years that are used to develop the Boeings, the Airbuses, the Embraers, the Part 25 aircraft of the world. And the way that you convince the FAA and thus the public that it is safe as you follow those same processes. I fundamentally disagree with folks that say because it's autonomous, because it's new, we need to invent new processes. That's completely bogus. We have processes to do this. It's just, it's a very hard, it's an arduous path. That's how you do it. That's how you get to 10 to the minus 8, 10 to the minus 9 and beyond.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we talked about the fact that, the military systems have not been able to prove it after millions and millions of flight hours. What's your view on the path to getting there? In terms of, data collection, time, whatever metric that you are using to track your progress along that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The metric that we use to track progress is how many regulations have we demonstrated compliance to so far? And there's processes for each. this is how certification works. You map out the regulations. you establish a certification basis, that says these are the regulations that are appropriate. You establish a means of compliance, an MOC. Fancy word, but just means how are you going to show that you meet the requirements. the, and then within each of that, there are processes. collect data, collecting data is a trigger phrase for me. You triggered me, it really irks me when people use that expression because I think, well, for what purpose? why are you collecting data? what system is this that you have where enough data on its functioning makes a safety argument? I'm not comfortable with a system where people say, well, because it worked for several thousand hours or because we did so many auto landings with it, it's safe. That's just bogus. That's not the way these processes work. That's how you get to 10 to the minus two. maybe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>obviously data is important. Obviously showing a track record is important when you talk to the regulator. how do you then view this challenge of proving to the regulator that in the absence of data\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>no, there is, I'm sorry. The collecting data is a trigger word for me because people talk about throwing their Autonomous plane up in the sky and building hours on it and collecting data so that they can further improve and modify the system. and then they, there's a double speak there where they often tie that to certification as if the FAA is going to say, Oh, you've flown 10, 000 hours, it must be safe. Okay, go for it. That's just irrelevant because it matters what it. You need to understand, like, well, what conditions did you operate the system in? did you just burn holes in the sky endlessly for 10, 000 hours? what were you really doing? I, we could take our plane and go burn holes in the sky over Mojave and perfectly clear weather with no other air traffic for 10, 000 hours, but what did we prove? Nothing. but\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it's configuration management. It is the right data logging. It's the right data management. obviously, it has to be structured in a way that resonates with the certification processes and all of the other applicable regulations. Absolutely. But, that's table stakes And so once that is understood, Talk about the development process, where you get comfortable and you get the regulators comfortable that you have achieved a certain, maturity level where you can field this to an aircraft and have confidence that whatever conditions they might encounter, the system will work and be safer than when the pilot is on board.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll go back and explain the certification process. There are hundreds of regulations that impact what we're doing. and each regulation has, Congress passes laws, FAA creates regulations that are, in compliance with those laws. The FAA then publishes guidance. on how they expect applicants, like us, developers of aircraft systems, to comply with those regulations. So within that, they publish guidance on, I'm trying to think of an example. regulation. says that automated landing systems need to be certified. and then they publish, an advisory circular that says, here's how we, the FAA, believe you need to demonstrate that you meet the regulation for an auto land system. And that, that one line regulation or paragraph may expand into a 700 page document. That 700 page document may reference other advisory circulars. It may reference industry standards. Maybe RTCA has published some guidance on how to tune a radio system that uses radio navigation for the purposes of auto landing and what the performance requirements of that system should be. This all expands out into thousands and thousands of pages. We actually summed all of this up, recently. we're well over, I think it's 27, 000 pages of documents, that we've brought into our system that are all FAA standards and publications and guidance that the FAA has put forward and blessed as applicable for Complying with the regulations. And these are just the ones that impact our system. There's actually much, much more in aviation more broadly. And so you have to dig into each of these standards and pieces of guidance that the FAA has published to get answers to questions like, well, how many hours is enough? Or how many flights is enough? How many landings is enough? In the vast majority of these cases, our certification approval that we received earlier this year, maps to about, I would say, 90 95% ish to things the FAA has already put out there. The stuff that doesn't match is dealt with in issue papers, and there, we've either proposed our own standards. We've said, hey, if we were you, FAA, this is the standard. And we just made it up. This is what we think the standard should be for this type of system. And we've gone back and forth with the FAA. It's taken many years, but we've gotten them to agree that's a reasonable standard for this thing. And now that's the standard that we're going to follow. In other cases, we've taken existing standards and we've proposed tailoring them. We've said, for example, the auto landing standard for Part 25 aircraft has a lot of really good stuff in it, and we're just going to leverage that, most of it, 98 percent of it, for Part 23. There's a few areas that we don't think are applicable to Part 23. Don't ask me off the top of my head what they are. we got the FAA to agree to that. Okay, so now you get into, let's take Autoland for example, I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but the Autoland set of standards, and this is hundreds of pages of documents that explain this, state that for you to get an automated landing system certified, you first have to build a very high fidelity simulation of your aircraft, and you have to show in simulation that the aircraft can hit essentially all possible, foreseeable, combinations of environmental conditions and aircraft configurations within whatever envelope you are intending to certify. So if we say that our system is good to 15 knots crosswind, then we need to show that for all density altitudes, and for all crosswinds, plus or minus 15, and all weight and balance configurations, and all aircraft configurations, and all possible, internal system failures that the aircraft could be experiencing, it will always bring the plane down to the ground within our performance window X feet laterally, Y feet, longitudinally, et cetera, and we're never going to exceed the G load limits of the aircraft. then you take the simulation, then you, from that, you say, okay, well, how do we verify that the simulation matches reality? And you have to choose test points in the real world that give you confidence that the sim is representative of the real aircraft. So you may want to pick the worst case aft CG configuration at the worst case density altitude at the worst case crosswind component, and then you have to go find a place in the United States to go do this. And that's why you go out to a place like Casper, Wyoming or whatever, and you stay out there for a couple of weeks until you hit that test point. And then you hit all your test points and say, okay, boom. Now, the simulation is good. We comply with all the Autoland requirements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in developing autonomous systems, you can broadly bucket into data, algorithm development, and testing, which one of those three do you see as the most challenging?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Say that again, algorithm development and what?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>broadly data, and in that it might be data collection, data annotation, warehousing management, so broadly the data bucket, then it's the algorithm development, and then it's the testing validation and verification.

Algorithms, while complicated, are just algorithms, and that's just work. and the testing is just work. It just, it's something that you just have to do. the really hard part, the most challenging task in all of this is to figure out how the autonomy maps specifically to the regulations,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>while we're on the topic of Algos, can you talk about the software that's behind your autonomous features?

Something else?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is very straightforward, normal software.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So rule based?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it's, this is, these, it's procedural logic, it's if statements, it's conditional logic, um, it's not machine learning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so in that case, you're a pilot. Most of us are pilots on the call. how much of the situations that one may encounter in flight do you feel that your software can be programmed to appropriately address?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If we can anticipate it, and this gets back to the processes that I was talking about earlier, there's a safety assurance process that's used in part 25 aircraft that we're using for the development of our system, where you enumerate all of the possible things you can imagine that will go wrong and you decide how will the system aircraft and pilot manage it and how to prevent a potentially hazardous or catastrophic outcome as a result. We're going through those exact same processes here. The difference is, we just don't have the pilot inside the aircraft to act as part of the system, if that makes sense. And it's hard. it's a lot more work when you don't have the human in the cockpit as the final node in your fault tree, to save the day and you don't get to defer the problem to training, then that means you need to implement an algorithm to, to solve it. And if we can imagine it, then we need to implement code or some feature of the system to mitigate that hazard. If you can imagine a hazard, we need to mitigate it. Period. That's how it works. Or we need to convince ourselves that it's like extremely improbable, like beyond 10 to the minus nine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>48:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>a lot of these, situations you cannot imagine ahead of time. So when is good enough, both good and enough, who makes that call? goes back to to how do you with authority stand in front of the operators, the people on the ground, the regulators, and say, we're good.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, maybe I'm not getting through. It's following the processes that the regulator has approved. That's how you do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So let's talk about cert, the processes, and if you don't mind explaining your certification path, and I'll just reference, one of your competitors, I think in 2021, petitioned the FAA for waivers for, a remote operation and was denied. how are you planning to avoid this situation? Can you give us a little bit more detail about your cert plans?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we don't intend to get in that situation. I am not surprised that their request was denied. there's a reason we have the certification process in the United States. And, I don't think they made a compelling enough argument to, short circuit that certification process. and so what we're intending to do is to follow the certification process. Our system is an STC that goes on top of the existing aircraft that's already type certificated, modifies it to enable remote piloting, and then the Part 135 air carrier certificate and the operation specifications associated with it need to be modified to support the STC. Much like today, if you have a 135 and you want to I don't know, fly CAT 2 ILS approaches, you have to write that into your OPS spec. You need to demonstrate to the FAA that you have sufficient training procedures to, teach your pilots how to run a CAT 2. they'll be the same kind of thing with our system where if you want to run our STC in your operation, you're going to have to write that into the OPS spec and you're going to have to coordinate with the FAA and get permission to do that. So for those of you unfamiliar with how airlines work, certifying an airline is just as complicated, if not more complicated, than certification of the on board equipment, the aircraft itself. the FAA gets very deep into how an airline runs itself, and the procedures that airlines use. There's a few obvious things like, pilot training that they get very deep into, because all airlines have chief pilots and chief pilots are responsible for, ensuring that everyone is sufficiently trained and there's standards that they need to follow. Safety management systems is another aspect that the FAA gets very deep into, and how, airline operators build and maintain safety culture is a big part of that. Maintenance is another obvious feature that the FAA gets very deep into.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right. Hey, Robert. so let's take a breath and let's go in a different direction here. Great discussion. How big is your addressable market today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, are we talking about today right now? Because I don't have a product yet. I don't have a certified\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>you had a product today. How big is the addressable market?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, our system is designed to be aircraft agnostic. And our intent is to take this STC, that we're first working on in the Caravan, and then modify it so that it can be put onto other aircraft. It'll be somewhat straightforward to do this for other Part 23 aircraft, a bit more complicated to do it for Part 25. But if we're including, Part 25, in your question, then the addressable market is huge. It's basically all of aviation. aviation is close to a, what, a trillion dollar industry now, drives four and a half percent ish of global GDP. and we think that we'll be able to access a very large portion of that. I should say to our business model, because I think this is important. is not just to provide the equipment. We don't want this to be a one time sale, but we're also providing all of the training and infrastructure necessary to install, deploy, maintain, and operate the autonomy as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are people willing to pay for today? And why? By market. And how much of it is safety driven? And if it's not safety driven, what's the key value proposition?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's safety driven. We were talking about that earlier.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Even 135 and 121, if there's a market with a 121 today, you're saying that the safety driven value is the number one driving need for autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's my position and I'm sticking to it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. And five years from now, you define the size of the market by the trillions of the size of the aviation market. But realistically, Let's say you're in front of a group of investors and they're thinking, is this a company, is this a space\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, you think I wasn't being realistic? All right, okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And if this is a space I want to invest in and this is a company I want to invest in, what are people willing to pay for in five years by market segment for autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>54:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most blunt way to put this that I think simplifies it, because yeah a trillion dollars, is a huge number. Let's see for your audience, let me decide how to answer this, because well, first, the most naive way to look at it is, okay, you're automating the aircraft. That's a function currently performed by the pilots. Well, what portion do, pilots contribute to the cost of aviation? And the answer to that is on part 25 aircrafts, it's close to 20 percent and on part 135, it's close to 30%. In some cases, it's 35 percent or more. A naive way to look at it is, okay, if all we do is reduce piloting costs, then it's 20 percent of the 800 something billion dollar, Part 121 world, which is a big number.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>54:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But Robert, it's not that autonomy would replace the pilot, it would just move it, right? There would be efficiencies in centralizing these pilot services so you can spread them around the network and make the network more efficient, that is for sure, but it wouldn't be a one for one replacement or removal of the pilot.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would think that autonomy is necessary for replacing the pilot in Part 121, but it's not sufficient. There are a lot of other things roles that the pilot is playing in the airline and in the operation of that flight, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, and I don't want to say that it diminishes that cost to zero, but it is a substantial reduction. some of that I think still needs to be tested, and we're working towards testing it as soon as we have our STC. We'll be able to, to go test out this and validate the unit economics, but it is a substantial, we are anticipating a substantial savings Right out of the gate. just by having the pilot sit in a control center, the effective utilization of that pilot goes way up. this is especially true in 135 operations, where, pilots typically fly less than two hours a day. And having them in a control center, they could fly a lot more. But then, that, I don't think that's looking deep enough that's, as I said, the naive way to look at it, the very, the oversimplification, where this gets quite a bit more nuanced, is when you look at how you can change the way your operations work, now that the pilot is in the control center. And the first thing there that we hear from operators that's most important to them is repositioning. Freeing the aircraft from the pilot, and this could even just be a completely empty plane that just needs to deadhead somewhere, a repositioning flight, would drive huge operational efficiencies. determining the value of this is complex. It depends on an operator to operator basis. But the feedback that we've received from many of them is that this is a substantial driver for them. The second is being able to, right size the aircraft, up gauge or down gauge. if you're remote piloting and you're flying an airplane that has a much more simplified interface, and the automation is taking care of all of the aircraft's specific details for you then, you don't necessarily need to be specifically trained, aircraft to aircraft. And so you can switch flying, one morning you might fly a Cessna Caravan, and then the next you might fly something like a Cessna SkyCourier. You can't do that today. It's not considered safe. It's not safe to have people trained up to fly multiple aircraft simultaneously and be jumping around back and forth because it's hard to maintain proficiency, across different aircraft types. maybe some pilots would disagree with me. I'm going to take that position, and there's many operators that take that position, even within, like, variations of the Airbus fleet. there's some operators I know, they will not let their 320 pilots that are trained to fly one avionics configuration fly the other because they don't consider it safe. So, remote piloting, you can now do that. and that, it also enables a huge amount of operational efficiency, being able to right size the aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what do you see as the time horizon for Reliable to be able to realize that vision? I want to tie back to Jim's question, on that five year time horizon, unlocking value for the company. You've been focused on the Caravan of which, roughly 3, 000 have been manufactured in its lifetime. a subset of those are in a type of operation that falls within your target market. But what does it take to expand the footprint of your product via STC into other platforms? How much time does that take? And does all of this happen within the time horizon that Jim laid out in his question, as we, we drill down from the top level market size down to the direct market that you can capture in five years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The key inflection point for us is, once we've got this system certified and operating on one aircraft type because of our focus on certification and the certification basis and all of the tools that we've developed to enable these, processes and analyses to be performed, don't anticipate it to take all that much time to transition the technology to subsequent aircraft. So I see an inflection point for us where once this is certified on one aircraft, boom, we can quickly scale to modify it and deploy it to other aircraft. So the time horizon question in my view gated or the critical path is on getting this very first system certified. That's the focus. so then you're going to ask me, well, when do you think that's going to happen? And it's hard to say. for all of the reasons we've been talking about previously, these systems engineering processes are very complicated and when you start digging into the details, you find things and it's hard to predict when you're going to be done. I can tell you when I'd like to be done. And I can tell you the dates that we have in mind, the team is tracking. but it's challenging to predict because nobody has ever done this before.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is your development path of a radar capability, is that on the critical path to what you're describing here?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The radar itself, the hardware, the software, the signal processing, no, the certification basis, yes, that is a component. I wouldn't say that's the, the biggest thing that's keeping me up at night, but it's certainly, it's a, an important component. The FAA has accepted, a set of standards for air to air radar. To my knowledge, nobody has yet driven that all the way through the certification process. We will likely be the first, and we're going to encounter things when we do that, and it's hard to predict how long it's going to take.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so when you, embarked on this project and you did the breakdown of, okay, well, are there ways that we can acquire this data? And I know that you have, done a lot of thinking on that. are there ways that we can lean on the supply chain to get a radar solution that meets our needs versus, what is the, time and investment and risk involved in developing our own? walk the audience through what those choices looked like and how you settled on this path?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, this is a recurring theme or nightmare of my career. we, we dealt with a lot of this at, previous companies that I'd worked at. you're trying to do something new. You're trying to put a product out in the world that nobody has ever done before. And you want to do it as quickly as you can. And so your mind goes immediately to, okay, who can we partner with? who can we get this component from? Radar was one where we had been trying for a very long time, to convince another set of developers, I won't mention any names, but companies you've heard of, to go build, a radar that meets our requirements, or rather meets the requirements the FAA has already published. And we've said, if you build this thing, we will buy it. And we've got customers, and this is how many units, you can expect us to purchase from you on this rough time horizon. And this has happened with us, with radars. It's happened, with actuators. It's happened with flight computers, with IO concentrator computers. It's happened with, our communication system. There's a couple of these key components that we didn't initially set out to build this ourselves, but we ended up deciding to bring it in house because we either, couldn't get anybody else to build it for us, period, we couldn't get anybody else to build it on a reasonable timeline, or we couldn't get anybody else to build it at a reasonable cost. And with the radar in particular, that was one where we went back and forth for a very long time, and eventually it just became clear that we're burning more time trying to convince this other group to go after this billion dollar market opportunity when we could just be spending this time building it ourselves. And at least then we build ourselves, when we encounter issues deploying it, which we inevitably will, it will at least be a misery of our own making.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So let's dig in on that project. what are the deficiencies that you are trying to address with this in house R&amp; D to build a radar that meets your needs? What are the gaps between what's available and what you want? And what do you see as the resources required to pull it off? Radar is not like a weekend project, right? It is an industry all in of itself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, it's not?

And so how do you look at that, risk versus reward profile?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first one realization was that radar, the components to build a more sophisticated radar have become more widely available in recent years. If we were having this conversation five years ago, I think you would be on much firmer ground to say that we're crazy. But now much of the signal processing technology, has become commoditized through deployment of global 5G networks. Antenna manufacturing is still, really tricky. and there are a few areas where we are still partnering, but, we're now the main integrator of the component. I'm not answering your question. You went to, What was the first part of your question again?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first part of the question was, the required resources and the gaps that you're trying to close between what's available in the market and what you need to have a radar solution that works in the National Airspace System for autonomous flight. And then what are the resources required to pull off that R&amp; D project and what is the, risk profile of that undertaking?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Roughly speaking, the air to air radar requirements for an autonomous aircraft, the reason you're putting a radar in there is to comply with 91.113 see and avoid requirements. And RTCA, a major standards body has been publishing, Minimum Operating Performance Standards for air to air radar systems for several years, the FAA has accepted, some of this work through, the TSO publications that they've put out. the requirements for those radar systems are largely a function of encounter speed, and within that, you have a range and resolution and tracking requirements, so you need to be able to see something at a certain range, you need to be able to infer its velocity at a certain amount of precision, and then you need to be able to track it, at some particular rate, and you need to be able to track a certain number of things, and you also need, a certain amount of visibility, vertically and horizontally. so those are the requirements. so this might be, I don't know, you might need to see out to 6 or 7 nautical miles, for example, and you may need to be able to see another aircraft that's moving 400 knots relative to you, for example. that then, it just goes to radar physics, and from radar physics, you conclude, okay, well, if we're going to use this radio frequency spectrum, then we need something this size and this power, and we need this many antenna elements, and then you go out to the market, now to answer your question, you look at, okay, who has a radar that meets these requirements, or is close, or could modify something to meet the requirements. In there, radar developers, fall into three buckets. you've got existing aviation certified radars that are designed for weather applications. those have incredible range, but the resolution and tracking is not sufficient. You've got military radars, which definitely have the range, definitely have the resolution and tracking capability, but they are tremendously expensive, they're huge, and they consume a lot of power. And it's hard to imagine how installation of some of those systems would be practical at scale on a Part 23 aircraft. And then you've got, sort of new entrant radar manufacturers that are using clever algorithms to do things at lower power with less, radar reflectivity information, and it's tricky to see how they modify those systems and scale them up, because they don't currently meet all of the requirements. And so that, that investigation led us down the path of, okay, let's try and convince one of these folks that are operating in the radar development space today to modify their system to meet the FAA's requirements. And that's ultimately what led us to where we are today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What technologies do you foresee being an important and necessary onboard part of an aircraft, as opposed to, being offered as a service? What do you think is the right combination for the mission that you are pursuing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think what you're question, getting at here, is what are the key technology components that are necessary to enable autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Especially in the context of detect and avoid, obviously you can have a radar onboard, which you are pursuing, but you can also, and you've had some experience, so maybe you can share some of the, insight with the audience here in terms of, asking for primary surveillance data from the FAA radar feeds. how do you think the market evolves around what ultimately gets equipped onboard versus what gets offered as a service. And then how does that change depending on the mission?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, I see what you're getting at. I think of the technology that enables autonomy in two different categories. Step one of autonomy is to have an autonomous aircraft. an aircraft that can manage itself through all phases of flight. The second thing you need is you need an airspace integration solution that integrates that autonomous aircraft into the system that we have today. And I see these as distinctly different things. Autonomy, or the airborne automation component, consists of all of the things that you would need to do automated taxi, takeoff landing. You need also a high reliability vehicle management system that can manage the fuel, circuit breakers, and all of the other subsystems that exist on aircraft, to keep the aircraft in a safe configuration. And now once you have that, once you have an aircraft that's capable of flying itself through all phases of flight, then it becomes a question of, okay, how do you integrate this into the airspace? And that's where you need to comply with 91.113 see and avoid requirements. And that's how you end up with the air to air radar. You need to communicate with air traffic control and surrounding aircraft. That's how you end up with the communication system. We have a dual redundant satellite communication system that we're working on certifying. And then finally, you need the ground control station, and to satisfy all of the human factors requirements associated with, with that interface.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>but specifically see and avoid, where do you see the, the market converging, onboard radars or, surveillance data that is provided as a service.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's actually long term it's going to be a fusion of many things, because air to air radar is good at certain things. Primary surveillance radar is good at other things. camera systems are good for other types of things. and so I think we'll see, a fusion. Our path that we're taking, now, and what we believe will first be accepted by the FAA for aircraft the size of the Caravan will be an air to air radar system, and that will meet the requirements and allow us to do operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can you tell us about your experience requesting primary surveillance data from the FAA?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, so primary surveillance radar, for those not familiar, these are radar systems that were initially put together by, a lot of them were built by the U S air force, for national security purposes. And then the data was released to the FAA for air traffic control purposes. They've since been augmented with transponder data feeds, and the combination of the primary radar with the transponder feeds, is frequently referred to as secondary surveillance radar. and the pictures of air traffic controllers, the screens that they're looking at is, is a terminal that shows you a fusion of primary and secondary, surveillance radar. Or frequently just secondary, but, they have the capability to see primary as well. Primary surveillance radar, in the United States, and there's some publications that the Air Force has put out there on this, is pretty incredible. There are very few places in U. S. airspace that are not covered by primary surveillance radar, and for the types of operations that we need to do with small cargo aircraft like the Caravan, it's possible to fly the Caravan and stay within primary surveillance airspace with sufficient margin to see all of the things around that aircraft. And we've shown through a variety of simulations. There was some work that we did with NASA several years ago on this. we've collaborated with some folks at MIT Lincoln Labs, on this as well. We've shown that you can actually use primary surveillance radar to solve see and avoid in certain airspaces in the U. S., not all, but in many of the ones that are economically relevant for our use case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Robert, does that account for the, the update frequency of primary surveillance radar and the latency in getting that data to the aircraft?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it's really a function, too, of, well, how it gets back to what I was talking earlier, about air to air radar requirements. it matters what air speeds do you expect to see encounters and how much separation buffer do you want the system to have. And so in areas where the update rate and resolution is lower, it just means you need to fly further away from other things that the radar picks up in order to maintain sufficient margins.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the update rate?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That I don't know off the top of my head.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, what's the likelihood you would get access to primary radar in the next couple of years at scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, so we actually had access many years ago. I think we talked about this in that article in The Air Current. and that was partly how we demonstrated the efficacy of PSR for solving this problem. and then we went to go do another set of test demonstrations and our access was revoked and the message that we got back was that too many other groups had taken notice of what we did. Word got out and so a lot of other people started requesting access and then somebody raised the specter of national security.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>without a doubt. it took 20 years for secondary radar information to be provided to the public. I can't imagine what it's going to take for primary radar data to be released.

We care about national security. I care about national security too. We anticipated this and we proposed a number of processes that the FAA and the DoD could use to secure the data. We even went so far as to, suggests that the data only be accessed within locked facilities that are access controlled and follow a variety of NIST standards for cybersecurity and none of that was accepted. And my understanding is, the FAA is continuing to look at this. They are making progress with the DOD on how to release the data. I've even had executives in the FAA tell me that they think it is in the interest of national security to release the data because if they don't, then it means private companies, potentially foreign owned private companies, might stand up their own radar networks and have better surveillance in the airspace than the United States government does.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stand up their own primary radar within the United States, foreign governments?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Foreign owned companies may do this, and I would say that there are private companies today that already have stood up their own radar systems at airports.

We've shifted our focus towards air to air radar. We are still, lobbying Congress and educating members of Congress and the FAA on the safety benefits of releasing primary surveillance radar.

I'll just leave it at that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, if I'm not mistaken, today you run a small fleet of Caravans.

We started this airline. We view it as an incubator and this gets to what we were talking about earlier with the certification of the airborne component and modifying the Ops spec for the airline. We decided to bring that portion of it in house so that we can modify the OpsSpec ourselves first in a very small airline, relatively small airline, I should say. And once we figure out how to do this and get the FAA to approve it, our intention is to then license it out so that other airlines can benefit from it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what do you see as the optimal position to occupy along the value chain? What are the pros and cons for each? Whether you're an OEM, an operator, an avionics supplier, an airframer, in this world of autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:17:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think there's places for everybody to, to get wins. OEMs are going to benefit because autonomous versions of the aircraft are going to sell much more than other versions. Maintenance providers, FBOs, are going to benefit because there'll be different maintenance challenges. We were talking earlier about ground handling complexities with remote piloting and how we're going to figure all that out. And fixed base operators and others are going to benefit from that. Component suppliers are going to benefit by pushing the technology out. Airlines, obviously, are going to benefit through operational efficiencies. Where we see ourselves fitting in is we want to provide a few of the core components, not all, but a few of the core pieces of equipment, and we want to provide the certification services to get the equipment put into use. And I'm talking about the airborne component as well as the Airline operations component. And then there will also need to be ongoing, services, communication services, as well as detect and avoid and other cloud based, aircraft management components that you'll need in order to be able to run this technology at scale. And I think that's an area where, we'll be able to provide value for our customers too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:18:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, do you see companies that are building autonomous flight technology in the small UAS space entering this value chain and being a player in the coming years? On the one hand, they are developing very rapidly. They're able to do tighter iterations. They're able to fly a lot more hours. On the other hand, they're, building their innovations in a different airspace regime, below 400 feet, different requirements for that. But I think one could argue that some of the technologies that are being matured there are advancing very rapidly and, have relevance in the rest of the airspace system. So when you look out ahead, where do you see those manifesting in the value chain?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:19:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I'd go back to what we were talking earlier about military UAS and applicability. I'd give you almost the same answer. in order to meet the certification requirements, the regulatory requirements, you've got to take it all the way back, to the beginning. And while I'm sure there are lessons being learned in the small UAS space and, we're benefiting from work that's been done there, early work with Beyond Visual Line of Sight, the core components and the regulatory basis, I don't see that carrying forward. It'd be like saying an autonomous fork truck in a warehouse is going to turn into a self driving car. Sure, like, there's aspects of it that we'll carry over, but it's just a very different design domain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:20:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you don't see potential of the safety case and the data built up in that domain being extended into other types of flight or other parts of the airspace system, that's really just not going to be a factor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:20:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I hate to give you a firm no, because there may be an element to this that I'm missing, but, I, I struggle drawing a straight line between the two. the Part 107, uh, 44807 exemption space, It's just very different from part 23 aircraft and part 25 aircraft.

Wernher von Braun was the designer of the Saturn V. and he said, I've learned to use the word impossible with the greatest of caution.

I don't think that's going to be a problem. However, I would pivot slightly on the technology that I really think that certification is the challenge. Certification is the challenge. We need the FAA to do this. This takes a massive public private partnership, and, I know I'm the one you're speaking with, but, and I'm representing Reliable Robotics, but I also feel like, the FAA has a big role to play here. And it's of crucial importance that Americans especially take note of this and inform members of Congress that the FAA needs support to do this. If we want the United States to continue to be a leader in aviation, we need to be putting more resources into the FAA.

Welcome back to The Vertical Space and our discussion with Dr. Yemaya Bordain as president of the Americas of Daedalean. From right out of the gate, Yemaya challenges, much of today's established thinking. Listen to what she says is an area where very few in the industry agree with her on. And where she questions the near term economic viability of the UAM model. And that she believes level four autonomy is needed for UAM economic viability. And listen to later in the podcast, when she believes level four, autonomy may come about. Those investing in UAM should pay close attention to Yemaya's comments. We first discuss the history of automation. The why of automation on a segment by segment basis. What has and what will drive the need and how does it scale? Followed closely by a detailed discussion on the levels of automation and the value of each. As well, as in what market the Daedalean is spending most of their time today and why. And how safety improvements are the biggest near term opportunities in this market. Listen to Yemaya's first discussion with operators on autonomy, particularly commercial operators. What's also interesting is the role or lack of a role for AI at the different levels of automation? Next is a detailed discussion on the future of avionics, starting with discussion of Yemaya's white paper. We enter into a detailed discussion on why AI needs multi-core processors and the difficulty of certifying MCPs. And listen to Yemaya's response to Luka's question on whether or not there can be a generalized approach to certifying MCPs and how Yemaya thinks that autonomy and certification of AI in MCPs will change the existing value chain in avionics. She also discusses the levels of automation where Daedalean will be generated revenue and what markets including AAM over the next 10 plus years. Her summary at the end of the discussion is inspiring. Yemaya, thank you for joining us and to our listeners, enjoy this terrific discussion with Dr. Yemaya Bordain as you innovate and The Vertical Space. Dr. Yemaya Yemaya Bordain joined to Daedalean in October, 2022, as president of the Americas to lead innovation, flight testing, and partnerships. Previously, she spent seven years at Intel developing industry, leading to advances in partnerships with top global OEMs, including Lockheed Martin corporation, Collins Aerospace, Indra systems, and Mercury Systems. She earned her BS in electrical engineering and MS in Computer Science at Clark Atlanta at University and a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, welcome to The Vertical Space. It's a real pleasure to have you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to be here today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We are, too. We are, too. So let's start with the one thing that very few in the industry agree with you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lately, I've been going to and even speaking at some of these Urban Air Mobility, conferences and I think that there's a business case, problem that, Urban Air Mobility has particularly for people carrying, operating cost, the cost of total ownership, the cost of the airframes, less range, slower, and carrying people, especially when they need to carry luggage, I just think that there, there should be some, analyses that is less optimistic than some of them that I've seen recently and, more feasible and truly take into account, how the airspace is operated today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. so the need for high levels of autonomy to scale is what you'd like to underline in this viewpoint, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, the economic viability in, our minds, it doesn't happen until one is able to scale and automation, autonomy, these will address the operating cost significantly and enable that scale. And so we believe that we don't see economic viability until at least what we call like a level four, autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interesting. let's set the stage, understanding that aviation has a rich history in automation from a hundred years plus. And so describe to us the evolution of automation in aviation from its very early days to today and how we think about autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh man, great question. I guess when we think about it in terms of that, automation and autonomy could potentially be its own scale, in relative scale versus absolute scale. I'm certain that, Sperry's gyroscope, seemed like a huge, device that drove automation. and it came only, what, six years after the Wright Brothers, flew, right? some other huge advancements included Fly by Wire, enabling, pilots. to fly the aircraft through a computer. that, that was huge, right? And in fact, one of my favorite technical papers that exists is, the, fly by wire system architecture that was published on the A320. It's, it honestly, it's actually what taught me how, important flight safety is and how people design safe systems. And then, finally today, autonomy looks like everything, being Digital, all pilot tasks moving toward being taken over by, ultimately silicon plus algorithms.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, historically, the introduction of, automation in flight. as I describe it, was initially because of the expansion of the envelope of the aircraft. aircraft became, faster, they flew higher, they flew farther. So there was a need to alleviate the pilot mechanically from, the stick and rudder skills. And it was much more difficult with these higher dynamic loads to move the control surfaces and therefore increasing level of automation. And then, I guess another phase could be the use of automation to reduce the cognitive load of the pilot to then, paint a better situational awareness picture or just operate more efficiently and safely in the increasingly, busy airspaces and complex scenarios. And so what about now? What is this? Is this a scale? the next frontier that introduces this new wave of automation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Luka, you mean in terms of the motivation for, why are we pursuing this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. this arc of introducing various degrees and kinds of automation and what is really the motivation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think you're right on with scale, accessibility, cost. In today's, general aviation market, it's, safety enhancements. general aviation has so much headroom for safety and automation can enable, GA to enjoy the safety levels that are available to the commercial market. I do believe that it's driven by cost, it's driven by scale, it's driven by, people wanting more accessibility. It's driven by our world, being more connected and requiring, being able to, engage a lot faster, right? There used to be email and, You could expect that someone would respond to your email within two days or then within a day. Now you just text people, right? So I think a lot of the driving forces behind it is really, along the lines of the trends of society today, mostly driven by scale and cost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Peter, since you asked, what jumps to mind to you when we introduce this arc and this motivation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think it's really interesting to look across the segments of aviation and, okay, number one, you look at the opportunity to automate, and then number two, you look at, well, what differential does it deliver and let's say in commercial aviation, it is, It's exceptionally safe today, it has a level of automation but it's not the type of automation that we're looking ahead to, nor is it, a level of automation that you would describe as autonomous behavior. but in that segment, there is, a lot of resistance to, bringing in high levels of autonomous flight, reducing cockpit crew from two to one. there are a lot of motivations that people are pursuing it, but there's a lot of resistance to doing that. in other parts of aviation, you have a different landscape. You do have a safety opportunity, but you might have, a different customer profile. Where I think it's really interesting is some segments of aviation, UAS, they're physically so small that putting a human on board to operate it is just, fundamentally not an option. This is a 40 pound air vehicle. And so in those segments, you have an incredibly high motivation to, bring the level of automation up to whatever is required for the mission, call it autonomous flight in some cases, if you want, because that's what makes the, mission possible. and in some of these segments, as you highlight, making that mission possible is world changing. It will change our perception of how we think about moving things around the world, how we think about the time and space around us. given all these different, segments of aviation, they share some technological similarities, they might be operating a different scale, it might be a different mission profile, but there's a lot of commonality in the technology that pulls this off, that allows us to achieve this vision and looking at it through that lens is what... has me so interested in this question of motivation because like everybody, I just took it for granted that of course we want autonomous flight. It's a new technological horizon. Let's go and build it. But then in conversations with people in industry, it struck me like, wait, let's take a step back and think about what is the real motivation and which segment of aviation is the path of least resistance to build up the technology, to build up the operational experience, that kind of organizational muscle, to then really realize the vision. And maybe it propagates from there, but where do you start?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so I, to address What you stated, it's such a good point. by training, I'm an engineer and I absolutely positively nerd out on new technology, and I find that much of the industry does that as well. And so your point of course we want automation. Of course we want autonomy. I initially geeked out about that as an engineer and just, this is so cool. We totally should do this. And it was after the fact that I challenged myself and my team to dig into why do you want autonomy? What does automation and autonomy deliver? And that's when we were able to, realize or, reveal that we want enhanced safety. We think that this can reduce labor cost. we think that this can enable the optimization of crew, it can streamline operations, potentially even, lead to simpler maintenance, fuel and energy consumption. We just, we realized that we wanted to focus more on the why of automation and autonomy, and of course, be pioneers of how we get there as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yamaya, it's interesting. you proud yourself on being a problem solver. I've read a lot about you and I've seen you in interviews and we're talking about the foundation of why autonomy, but the reason you say some people may not agree with you is that you're saying that the advanced air mobility passenger carrying world won't be viable without what you're claiming to be fully autonomous, which is, four out of the five stages. So you're saying that the very business proposition of AAM won't be viable without autonomy. So that's a pretty darn good reason. A lot of us agree with you on that. And so if we need a motivation... For autonomy and advanced air mobility, this is one of them, because even the public companies are saying that we can be profitable, but for them to be able to meet their financial projections, some level of autonomy, you call it fully automated automation, as\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>automation. Yeah,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You're saying that has to be achieved. So what a motivation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that you can only get there when you sit down and start talking to operators. and in particular, you start talking to today's civil airspace, those operators. I remember having, meetings with a very large operator and, I was so focused on how cool the technology was. And, this is when I started at, Daedalean, I was so focused on how cool the technology was that I just assumed that he got it when I said automated or autonomous. And I didn't get the same kind of excitement from him that I expected. And I took him to the side and I said, Hey, can you give me, very direct feedback? Why weren't you so excited? And he said, well, one, I don't think that automation or autonomy is going to happen for next decade. that makes you not very useful to me, right now in, in what you're providing, if you're leading with that. but secondly, he said, Yemaya, we are not, a risk environment. We, are margin constrained and. It was like, Oh, right and so what I realized is that we need to solve the problem. We're problem solvers, each one of us, even, the engineers. I was trying to solve a technological problem, but we're really supposed to be solving an operational problem. And that operational problem is an economic viability issue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. we had, several guests in the course of the podcast series where we discussed autonomy and it's always interesting to hear their thoughts on the reasons why autonomy, we talked a little bit about this now over the last several minutes, but I think it's worthwhile hovering a little bit more and going to a bit more detail, perhaps on a segment by segment basis, commercial, airline operations, part 121 operations general aviation, UAS, all of the other segments. And describe what are some of the common misconceptions in terms of the reasons for autonomy, versus what you think autonomy is helpful for, right? what's in the back of my mind is a conversation that we had with, Brian, Yutko from, Wisk, and on that topic, he mentioned that, a common misconception is that people tend to drive their economics discussion around autonomy in terms of the removal of the cost of the pilot in the operation, whereas he says, no, that's totally not the point. The point is in a better management of an asset, from a network perspective and being able to reposition those assets and separate the human operator from the actual vehicle and how that opens up the, operational freedom and the network design freedom, which totally makes sense and similarly, there are. misconceptions around safety where people jump to the conclusion that, removing the pilot will automatically result in safety. So give us your thoughts around this. It's a kind of long way of saying, let's go a layer deeper into why autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I, absolutely positively agree with Brian. We also are not driving toward removal, or, nor do we think that in, in every, application, the removal of a pilot is the best thing. And in fact, when we deliver talks and talk about the levels of, autonomy, we've started looking at those in terms of Search and Rescue, there's, Offshore Oil, Transport. There is, Law Enforcement and Surveillance. We, there's HEMS, there are many that we said, yeah, these could be along the spectrum. of, automation, but they're not appropriate for full automation and full autonomy. And, we define the difference between the two of those, as full automation the aircraft is, self separate, but there is a human in the loop. who is monitoring, the decisions that are being made and then for full autonomy, there's no human in the loop. This thing just runs, by itself uninterrupted and unmonitored. And, so for that reason, we think that it is a common misconception that saying that you want to, develop autonomous or automated systems means that you want a world where there are no pilots. it's quite the opposite. We want pilots to, be managing the decisions, the processes, that are reserved only for humans that's where we think that, it continues to be in, especially in very, dynamic and, environments that are changing quite a bit. And even in those, we talk about that a bit as well of when should you use AI versus not AI and where there are benefits. But, we want to augment pilots, we want to support pilots, we want to lower the pilot workload, we want to enable operators to scale, we want to address the cost by using, resources a lot more efficiently.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you looked across, those different operations and CONOPS, on the one hand you look at the ultimate manifestation of autonomous flight and you say, okay, well, where does this really fit in? And maybe it's transoceanic cargo as you mentioned, did the stepping stones to get there also surface from all of those conversations where you see, hey, okay, here's the state of the art today. And if we push one step further, what is a sensible application for that where we could, deploy it, build up experience with it and have a marketable. solution out there. did the path to get there, surface from those conversations? And I'd love to get your thoughts on what that looks like, whether we really need AI or not in order to go down that path. what did that look like? what emerged from that\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. We looked at these different CONOPS. we approached it in a few different ways. We looked at the, segments, the market segments within aerospace and, not including defense. we don't, support defense applications as a company. and we looked at GA, we looked at commercial, we looked at even, UAS and we looked at UAM, it as its own kind of use cases or segment as well. because we do think that it in the way that it will, be developed, it'll be, a pretty unique, use case or a pretty unique segment. we looked at those and we segmented them in margin versus volume. We, also looked at, the, pilot tasks that can be automated, as you go along. So for instance, being able to detect obstacles or other, aircraft, in the airspace. and we looked at it in, in ConOps and what we were trying to get to, is where automation and autonomy could address, a segment that, is currently high revenue generating, even if it's not high margin, because the costs are so extreme, or the costs are just, they're prohibitive, put it that way. and we thought through some of those applications and then we dug more into those and what parts of that if we were to, automate certain tasks or automate, certain parts of, these operations, what, how could we get a bigger bang for our buck, in order to enable, these things to scale? We also, took some applications that we think probably would fall under kind of lower automation, say for instance, Search and Rescue, where, you know, the environments are really dynamic and the mission itself is dictating, say, the navigation, of the airframe, right? And in those cases, we thought that, okay, how can we support the pilot workload, the pilot that is, flying, but then there's the, operator that's managing the mission, right? That's basically telling the pilot, go here, go there. So we thought about that as well. And we said, look, we just don't think that there is a huge opportunity here, but there are definitely some specific tasks and areas where, we can assist the pilot. And so we thought through that as a spectrum and we went through tens of CONOPS in order to rank them along, different scales.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You have mentioned level four and level five automation. do you mind just mentioning the five just for our audience? Because it's cool how you refer to CONOPS and levels of automation, but if you could just, go from assistance to partial automation to highly automated, just briefly define them for our audience. And then as you refer to from level one to level five, they'll have a sense for you, what you mean by, for example, even where's the low hanging fruit for automation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. Level one, human has, full responsibility. And this is just for task assistance. So the AI, Pilot Not Flying or, AI Co Pilot. Sometimes we call it AI Co Pilot. Sometimes we call it Pilot Not Flying or Pilot Monitoring it provides just assistance to the pilot for, situational awareness. And the AI provides... situational intelligence. So this is the ability for the pilot to not only understand the current situation, but also to be able to predict the future and anticipate, any potential problems in the future. So what humans do today with semantic understanding is that we paint a picture and we're able to identify threats that could happen in one second, five seconds, 10 seconds. That's what the AI brings. And in this case, we are just providing the pilot with task assistance. and our first product, PilotEye is a great example of this. PilotEye is a traffic advisory system that uses, camera inputs and neural networks to draw a box around anything else that's in the airspace. And, what is the value proposition there? Well, when you're using cameras and neural networks, we identify non cooperative traffic. We identify birds and drones and paragliders and, hot air balloons, right? And the point is not necessarily to say this is exactly where it is, but the system, it provides that input to say, look up. There's something there, and we, we want your attention here because we see something there that is not, going to be identified, through a transponder.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Yemaya, what segment of the market are you targeting with Pilot Eye?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, PilotEye is, GA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>that's interesting because as we were discussing earlier, GA is the segment where, safety is a concern more than for other segments of the market. But at the same time, it is a segment that doesn't really have a high willingness to pay for new technology. So how have you thought through the business case. How do you articulate value?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Oh my gosh. That is such a great question because this is the, it's the ongoing question, right? And sometimes it's even, what divides your BD team from your engineering team? Because engineers want to do cool stuff. and engineers want to develop the best of the best and we have to remind our teams that, Hey, just to let you know, right, these things need to sell for 15K, 20K, right, 30K.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. And at the same time, the community is struggling to sell 500 transponders,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. Absolutely. this is where that analysis that I spoke of earlier, where we assess the market along ConOps, but also along, the high revenue generating, ConOps and applications because there is a bit more flexibility in those markets and then we drive toward there. And there are some applications where. I've had conversations with, operators and they've stated, yes, we won't pay, I'm making it up, a hundred K for this, but definitely the cost benefit justifies, us paying more for this because this is a real threat for operations and it could lead to loss of airframe, which in that case, then you're talking about millions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>PilotEye has applications for Level 1 automation, which is the category of assistance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Level two. What about\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Level 2 partial automation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Level two. Human pilot still has full responsibility. the AI pilot not flying, provides assistance and forecasting risk in offering mitigation. Again, this could be something where, the, the system not only, identifies that the traffic is there, but it also could say that, there is a bird there and you are on, a direct collision course and it could offer mitigation in, for instance, providing a maneuver. So this could be like a TCAS2. if we, plug this into closed loop with, TCAS2, that, that provides some mitigation. Level 3.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If I may real quick, yeah, I'm assuming Captain Sullenberger would have, that would have been extraordinarily valuable in this situation where if he could have been notified, I think there were Canadian geese that around this certain direction. I'm not sure what he could have done different. Luka could probably could answer that better than me, but I would assume with that kind of capability in a commercial aircraft, would be a big deal where there's a lot of birds and obviously that had near catastrophic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that's why, as we're introducing PilotEye, that's why many get it. One operator that we met, he'd been flying helicopters basically his entire life because he learned, to fly from his dad. And he said while he was in, fixed wing training that he almost hit a bird and he, I think he said that he dove and he said, if I had your system during that time, he said, I thought I was going to die. And I could have died. I wish that your system was available to us at that time and, for the same reason, we think that you're right we can't say what could have happened, if Captain Sully had a system like ours, but we would love to believe that our system could have made, a difference in, the impact in the first place.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, can we quickly climb through the ladder and get through level five and then we'll get into the topic of, certifying these systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. level three, automated, autonomy, or automation, rather. the human pilot, it's either remote or on board, and it's still responsible for the decision making and execution of the system. And the AI, pilot monitoring provides, full guidance and, while the pilot still remains fully responsible. And this could be a system that, identifies a runway and then provides full guidance all the way down, to a safe landing. Level 4 is fully automated. In this case, the human pilot, is remote and supervises all of the AI decisions. And, the AI co pilot, is promoted to the pilot flying while there is a human pilot that is supervising and, can always interject if a wrong decision was made, but in this case, the airframe, the aircraft is self separate in, in the air. And then finally, Level 5 is what we call autonomous, that's the difference between fully automated and autonomous, and that's where there's no human and the, the AI pilot flying, has full authority.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What would be very cool to know, we're going to talk about certification here in a second, what would be very cool to know is what's the total available market, now, three years from now, five years from now, ten years from now, by level. you don't need to answer it now, but would be interesting is, my guess is four and five are near zero today. and then by level what's the available market for your technology with its application of AI, that would be interesting to know, you don't need to answer it now. Maybe at the end of the podcast or, maybe at another time to see what these opportunities are, in\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's great. Our team is going to go back and definitely take a look at, from that perspective. I love it. That's a great way to slice this as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in preparation of the podcast, we've read your white paper with Intel, I think it was earlier this year, on the future of avionics. and there were some really interesting points that, I'd love to uncover in a bit more detail here. the paper outlines, really two main challenges around the future avionics. One is the software assurance problem for AI and for neural networks, and in this case for Pilot Eye with the use of neural networks and computer vision, And then the second one as these neural networks require really higher levels of computational resources, necessity to use multi core processors in avionics. two really fascinating topics for us. So let's start with the first one or actually you pick, but let's uncover both of these angles in some level of detail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. now we're getting into my passion and where I start to nerd out because by training, I am a, Silicon Person. My doctorate is in electrical and computer engineering I did atomic force microscopy looking at, individual, transistors and how, electrons and photons, I'm sorry, electrons and,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I like that. Infotants.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How they move through individual gates. And so this is really cool. I was at Intel for, what? Seven years before going to Daedalean. And I actually met Daedalean, in my work at Intel in driving, multicore adoption to higher DAL levels in the avionics space. So I love this topic of processing and how to, compute massive amounts of data, on systems that have to meet the size weight and power constraints of gravity. This is, again, on, this, idea of high performance computing, this is where gravity becomes a big challenge. and so I've spent, years trying to support and solve this problem. The challenge with, artificial intelligence is, again, it requires a lot of processing, resources that for certification or systems that needed to be certified, systems that were safety critical systems, it's pretty unprecedented to require this much performance. And, for instance, flight control systems don't require a whole lot. but, when you're working with a lot of data and you're needing to process a lot of data very quickly, particularly that are coming from, image frames, it becomes quite challenging. So this was a problem that Daedalean did not set out to solve when the company was founded in 2016, our co founders were fully intent on solving the software problem. And, that software problem is really around how do we ensure software assurance when it's a machine learned system, and you're running machine learned algorithms. And Daedalian worked with the EASA and published the first guidance or theory on an approach on how to certify machine learning and found that, some of the differences is in, say, Software Assurance, Code Traceability is really huge. Well, when it's a machine learned system, data traceability is just as, or even more important, for those systems. And, we co published with the EASA, a series of papers, CODAN, Concepts of Design Assurance for Neural Networks. And this was the first guidance on how to manage machine learning systems. And we found that really the focus should be on the data management, data verification, ensuring that, your learning process is managed extremely well and, with high assurance and the way you train your models, all these things in, verifying that there's a, the learning process verification. There's the, model implementation. These are all along this process of assuring what we coined with the EASA in this, in these papers, learning assurance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can we talk about learning assurance a little bit more? Because even from the white paper, it left me, wishing for more, especially how you decompose the system level requirements into ultimately data sets, the algorithms, how you create these, offline, independent, annotated data sets. Tell us a little bit more about that particular aspect, how you run this learning assurance and, reach a level that is, by your own judgment, similar to software assurance for running a DO 178 project, for instance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah. we, we said if I were to summarize what CODAN says, it essentially said that we want to ensure that the data that you train on is representative to your operating environment. And everything from there was how do you ensure that happens? And you have to get a ton, collect a ton of data, right? So we have to be basically constantly flying in order to collect, as much data, as we possibly can. You have to ensure that you have some processes and structures around, how you annotate that data. you have to ensure, that you, are managing the training of that, and the implementation, the verification and implementation, very tightly. And this idea of generalization or, ensuring that your data that you train and how you manage that data is representative of the real world. That is probably where the secret sauce is that we did not publish. And, the question, would remain, well, how much data do I need in order to get there? CODAN is really about the process in that way. It's very much so DO 254, DO 178C, right? It's really about the process, right? And operating in a very processed way, making sure that you have traceability, making sure that you are, clearly identifying and, describing your requirements, and that those requirements can be tested, right? And that, you're not using your training data on your testing set or the other way around, right? To make sure, that you're not over training. And so in, the CODAN paper and that approach, is very much guidance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What can you tell us about this generalization and this data collection in a way that represents the actual real world environments? We'd love to learn a little bit more about that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'll give an example. Let's take PilotEye for an example. for PilotEye, we say that we want our system to be able to identify, traffic and, draw a, a box around it. and, in that case, your training data needs to be, a whole lot of data where you are seeing traffic. And where, you want to ensure that your requirements are well constrained. We start out on PilotEye in, daytime VFR. Right. And so that's, more about, well, then when the system goes into operation, we don't have performance guarantees on it at night because it's been designed and the process that we went through in our requirements, in our performance guarantees were around operations and daytime VFR. So that's one example of, how. We walked through, ensuring generalization, again, the secret sauce, and because we are currently, as far as we know, and even what EASA has stated publicly, we're the only company that is, in this process, we had stages of involvement, or SOI audit with the EASA, a few months ago, and that was the first time that had been done. It was a historic, event for us and for the EASA. we're learning along the way of how you actually prove that. that is another one where proving it is, the trade secret. And, that's something that we do plan to publish once we get certified.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was just about to ask you that question, so I'm glad you brought it up. as I see it, perhaps there's two kind of sub discussions in this topic. one part of the conversation is addressing the non determinism of the systems. And, perhaps from your perspective, it's unfair to say that it's non deterministic, even though it's not a line by line kind of determinism it still doesn't produce a random result. There is still some kind of, probabilistic, obviously, but in inferring the function that takes the input to the desired output, even though it's not as transparent as line of code, it's still not random. So you can argue that there is some, I won't call it determinism in the DO 178 sense, but, there is some comfort there. But I think the more difficult question, is how do you actually prove that you can achieve safety, and established safety in all of the possible conditions that you can find yourself in. I think that's a much more difficult problem to do, correct? How do you view these two different arguments, and what's the latest regulatory thinking on it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, taking for a moment, taking certification out, just in, in software development and software engineering, Determinism is some given input, being operated on by a given operator I have the same output, even by the way, if that output is wrong every single time, but if it is exactly the same every single time, it is by definition a deterministic system, right? And that's what we're trying to get to. We're showing that, if in the way that we treat the data and in achieving generalization. That for given set of inputs, and that set of inputs is well defined in the requirements that, running through our model, we always will get the output, meaning that it'll be identified, say for a pilot eye, as an example. And so that means that we have to be clear and sure, on the where and what conditions it should be, operated. And again, if it's designed for daytime VFR, yes, it turns out that we've actually had some folks that have tested, our system at night and they're like, it works great at night. Well, that is great for us, but still, in getting certified, those performance guarantees are for very specific conditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so what stands in the way from having some of these frameworks for certifying ML based software be accepted as a means of compliance? What are the main remaining concerns that EASA, FAA, and other regulators around the world have?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The EASA is a bit further along, seemingly at least, with CODAN on how to treat, machine learning systems. I think one challenge and the bigger one that comes to mind right now is just in, having a harmonized approach. And our company is working, pretty closely, in order to drive towards some harmonized approach. Keep in mind that, PilotEye is currently in a process. And it's in a process through the FAA with concurrent validation with the EASA. And we gotta answer some of these questions as we're in the process, and I think we are. this process has been one that, from our perspective, we are we're thrilled, in it. Not saying that, any one of the agencies are, being progressive in any way, that definitely is not the case. however, one thing that we've noticed is that the agencies are really digging in and for instance, through CODAN, the coauthors on the EASA side, they previously had no experience with machine learning and they dug in, they got statistics, they dug into really understanding what is happening here so that they could provide some guidance, that, could support the overall objective of, providing some guidance for acceptable means of compliance. And so I gotta give kudos to both agencies because, they are learning and they are asking us a lot of questions and they are challenging us. And, they are, as we, drive toward this, this development and this effort, we are finding, that everyone wants to ensure that we do the right thing,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>other than harmonization, what are some of the ways that they challenge you? What are some of the questions that they raised?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, some of the questions, I'll say, Alright, one, one is, our CEO, Luuk, he has published a series of, blogs and blog posts and a video on explainability. And, so this is one area where, our approach and our, thoughts on explainability there could potentially be at least some areas where this, there's, some misalignment, and, so that's one of the areas where we're like, okay, what does that mean? And even if we have, a different approach or, We don't value that approach as much what does that mean for this project? And essentially, what do we have to do in order to prove explainability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in terms of accumulating enough data to represent the real world environment, what's the role of synthetic data in this process? And what are some of the challenges that exist in leveraging synthetic data in simulation? How much is the regulator giving those, quote, credit?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That I can't say for certain, as I'm not that deeply into, the credit. I can say that, we leverage simulated data, for sure. Of course, in aerospace, flying is quite expensive, and so we leverage, simulated data. I can't say how much, but we definitely do in our approach.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And do you think that startups are at a disadvantage relative to incumbents as it relates to exactly this point of the, the cost associated with obtaining real world data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what is the role of startups?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the role of startups is in, the innovation part. Startups have been phenomenal for driving the innovation that will transform aerospace. I really do believe that. I think startups have some risk, many have some risk of, not remaining super focused on their core IP. and, I see a lot more, vertical integration with, startups than you would for the more traditional aerospace market that it has been moving directly in the opposite direction for the last 10 or 15 years, right? in the broader aerospace market, open systems is everything. The United States DoD, they, at some point, they got sick of, the large air framers, I won't call any names, but the large air framers charging them insane amounts of, money just to change out a chip because For instance, it was something that it was an ASIC and it wasn't commercially available. It wasn't commercial off the shelf. So this, idea of vertical integration, there are parts of it that can be, a distraction for some startups that are, developing airframes. And I think that, your time to market is really important. you don't get credit for efficiency, you get credit for delivery focusing so much on your core IP and making sure that you're better than anyone else in the entire world on your core IP and outsourcing basically everything else when it is feasible and when it's viable, and leveraging the existing ecosystem. I believe those are the folks that are going to win.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As you were doing your certification with EASA, I'm assuming this is certification level C. is it, essentially level 1 through level 3? Okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is, well, two different things. DAL C, that's Design Assurance Level. Pilot Eye is, we're taking that to DAL C. That is separate from, the levels of automation, the PilotEye, we'd consider that to be a level one, assistance, pilot assistance system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But none of their certification so far is DAL A. You haven't, DAL B or to DAL A? Okay. It's all DAL C.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh gosh, yeah, Yeah, just so that we're reminded, there is currently, I believe there's currently only one computer, that is certified to DAL A, that is, on a multi core processor. That is running a CPU that is, I believe, already end of lifed, or close to end of lifed. and... A GPU that has already been end of lifed, this takes a long time, right? And so add AI to it and I think that, our first goal in delivering product and delivering, value has been, we just want to prove that you can certify AI. And once we prove that, right, then we can drive toward, higher levels, but keep in mind as well that you don't start with, I want to build a DAL A system or I want to build a DAL B system or DAL C system. You start with the intended function. And, you take your intended function, and then you break that into sub functions, and you, apply a functional safety or, hazard assessment, against those, you assign a hazard classification from level A through E, with A being the highest safety level, safety criticality, that's like a flight control system. With a level E being no, impact to safety. That is the toilet or the, in flight entertainment system. and only when you have a hazard classification, do you start designing your architecture because that tells you how much, mitigation that you need to apply, to any potential, hazards or, safety hazards. And those, mitigations can include redundancy, dissimilarity, for any commercial aircraft the flight control system is not only redundant but dissimilar. And there are flight control computers that are controlling individual flaps, or flight control surfaces, but those are copy exact two to three times, sometimes even four times. And then separately, those flight control computers are designed by two different companies, two different teams, and in most cases, even two different silicon, such that they want to ensure that there is no opportunity for, common mode errors when designing the software. For instance, if I, I have one piece of software that, leads to a fault, that, that does not cascade to every single flight control computer, on my airframe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, let's talk about multi core processors, MCPs. You mentioned that there's only one DAL A certified MCP, and it's using end of lifed CPUs and GPUs. We talked briefly about why AI applications need MCPs for the higher... compute requirements of, running, AI based algorithms on it. But why are MCPs so difficult to certify?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, MCPs are great. In the same way that MCPs are being used, in commercial electronics, for the higher performance, for, the lower power consumption, for the improved efficiency, scalability, being able to execute multiple workloads concurrently, low swap, all those things, are the reason for consumer electronics. Same thing in the Airframe. The issue, though, is that when you need to be certified, the software that's running on the, processor can no longer control all of the behavior of the silicon. So, for instance, in a single core processor, the software, and by software I mean the, the real time operating system, folks like, WindRiver, Lynx, Greenhills, they build this software, in, in that case, you're not competing for resources, you have only one core, you that is doing all of the computing, all of the processing and heavy lifting. And that one core is not competing, with another core for resources, more specifically memory, memory and cache, right? And so when you add additional cores, though, you lose the ability for the software to, control, all of the behavior of the processor. And so now, Core 1 and Core 2, or Core 1, Core 2, Core 3, Core 4, they're all competing for registers. They're all competing for memory, and to put an instruction, into memory, right? And what they generally do today is you start with partitions, and they partition based on the DAL level. And, the overall goal is to achieve, or bound, the worst case execution time. So that means that, let's say, I have, a system that is doing, some navigation, but it is also running, some, say, flight controls. pilot Pull Side Stick, that is a DAL A process, and there should be nothing that is possible that could interrupt that. There should be nothing, no way possible, that instruction, can be kicked off of memory because something else has come up. And, that other thing is now the higher priority. This happens, in consumer electronics, they're actually designed to do these things because, for performance, right? And so I, if I'm working on, Microsoft Word and I switched to another application and now I'm going to start streaming and I go back to my Microsoft Word, right? when I'm clicking back and forth and I'm telling it to do stuff and, play here, but also I want to go back and I want to start typing, for performance requirements, there are times where, for instance, instructions can be kicked out or they can be de prioritized and they're designed to do that. that's how you're able to get the gains that you are from, multi core processors. But, there should never be a case where a DAL C, application such as, displaying, traffic is more important than being able to control the airframe. And, this is why it's... It can be difficult, to certify MCPs because it comes down to a software issue and the software, not having, in the MCPs. The consumer processors not being designed with the tools for the software to monitor the processes, to control the processes fully, and ultimately to bound the worst case execution time. And, in these designs, we turn out to actually, I just say throttle the performance of the MCPs in order to make these guarantees for as much as we can on, developing the software that is going to run on, the processors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so, to what extent is certifying MCPs a purely technical problem of making sure that all of these interference channels and this fight for resources is managed? As opposed to the challenge of just not having visibility into the processor architecture because one of the things that you brought up in the white paper is that, silicon manufacturers are not very keen in sharing that level of detail that you would require in order to build this, resource sharing or mitigation that you mentioned. So, Which is it? What's the main problem? And in the case of, Intel through, the Airworthiness Evidence Package, sharing these... Certification Artifacts, does that solve the problem or is there still a problem remaining?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, This is, it's such a great question. So the airworthiness, evidence package at Intel, that is my claim to fame, I, co architected, safety critical avionics solutions and products for Intel, that product line is my baby and, where I really started in, safety applications, in aerospace. And the issue for the developers of these systems, they have to ultimately be able to predict every possible, failure condition that can happen, and that means that they need to be able to predict the behavior, every possible behavior of their system, right? Their ability to do that is limited to how much information they know about what the processor does and why it does what it does. And the Airworthiness Evidence Package. was about providing, that transparency to the developers, to the embedded, OEMs who are developing these systems. We, went through an analysis with them, and we wanted to understand, what is it, when you say that you want us to support you, OEMs, of the world who want to design in Intel. What is it that you actually need? What do you want? what information are you looking for? And initially when we got that information from them, we realized that there was a good amount of it that was trade secret. to the point that. it wasn't even available to just broadly to the company. And the second issue that occurred was that, the aerospace volumes are just not there. to get a company that is producing millions of processors per day for, consumer electronics orders and orders of magnitude, more volume to get them to operate outside of the process and provide transparency. initially there's, there was no real opportunity there, but what changed that was, it started with the autonomous driving, And a lot of what was necessary was needed for that as well. And Autonomous Driving immediately, they saw that, these are going to be volumes upon volumes of essentially then we also had the opportunity to be part of driving data centers, and there was a big opportunity. And so the aerospace teams, myself, in leading these efforts, we took advantage of what was already happening in order to support the automotive industry, and we conducted a gap analysis between the DO 254 with the, the 26262, which is the, safety guidance, on the automotive side. And for the data, there was data that already, existed, but we generally would not provide. This included, single event upset data, which we would never provide this data because in, in many ways, a knowledgeable, company with this information could essentially reverse engineer, the, architectures and get trade secrets, if they had that information. And so we provided that. We provided, then some, functional safety, failure modes, and errors diagnostic analyses, so we provided failure rate, we ran it through tools, in order to identify, some very critical, behavior of the silicon, such that then when it, was integrated into or would be integrated into a, system that the developer had enough information, that they could provide mitigations. It doesn't mean that you necessarily control it. It could mean that, okay, well, because I don't know when it's going to do this, or, this fault will happen in these very specific conditions. Now I have that information. Maybe that means that I need to provide redundancy and I need to run a separate, processor alongside it and then do some kind of checks, or maybe I need some kind of monitor of, another, processor, such as, say, like an FPGA that is monitoring the silicon and can do something when, this failure condition occurs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>do you think that there is a, path to a generalized approach to certifying MCPs as opposed to having to go through, a lot of, detailed analysis every time that there's a new processor on the market?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I, I think that we're probably about as generalized as we can get, the guidance is meant to, support, what is currently available. It's, CAS 32A, and I think it's the 193? Now, CAS 32A, I believe, is 193. And, so I think we're possibly about as generalized. When there's new silicon, there needs to be detailed analyses and particularly when silicon is meant and designed for a non safety application.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if you take one of these MCPs this certification process what's the expectation in terms of how many years it will remain technologically viable in the market? how much time do we get out of these things before either it becomes obsolete or before it's no longer available in the supply chain and you just have that inventory and that's it? What does that look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, these things go into service for 20 and 30 years. when you have an OEM, an air framer who is aligned on the silicon, you have to be ready to support them for decades. because the cost that are required in order to, provide assurance for these systems are so great. I'm only saying, right now we're talking about just the design, right? Software is its own monster. there was one case where I met with an OEM, a developer, and they said that, they had converted from Intel, by then they had converted from Intel into Power Architecture. By the time I was meeting with them, they said that it was like a decade ago. They said that still they were spending$1 million per year on the architecture, change. And this was in software investment. So it is great, the investment in, getting these things certified. And so they're expected to run, basically forever, essentially. and by the way, this is exactly why when there is a system that goes to market, when it goes to market, there are many stories that folks, particularly on the military side, they can say. I think the worst example was, I had a conversation with an officer. in a military agency that said, the day after we went into service of this airframe, the following day, we received a obsolescence, notice on the silicon this happens often. It's normal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wow. That's such a long timeline for these products. It's totally different than... other industries, and obviously it has all of these downstream implications for, how It's employed in higher level systems, obviously, which is fascinating.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely. And so this is why, we say, well, that we have that one system that's available. And I think it was launched last year, I believe. And, a year later is, the end of life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, would you... encourage innovators to develop multi core computers, and taking them through certification, ground up, or are you a proponent of taking whatever is best of breed in the commercial world and somehow running it through the cert process?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's not really possible to take, a consumer electronic device, and get the higher DALs, it starts, let me take that back, you have to have an insane amount of information that most consumer electronics companies don't, that information doesn't even exist because they don't test for certain things. and so it is very difficult to start with, a consumer electronics device and meet high DALs. And certification starts from day one and from the ground up and there are many companies, by the way, that are developing, rugged, certifiable computers. There's an entire ecosystem that has been created in the last 10 to 15 years that's fully dedicated to developing these systems and I say that's one area where you should just work with the existing ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How do you think that autonomy and certification of AI and MCPs change the existing value chain in avionics and how value is distributed. How do you think that the Avionics value chain will be disrupted?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is a great question. We're seeing a good amount of this across the tech industry as a whole. And, in this market today, it's the avionics OEMs and the air framers who are relied upon to drive innovation, but they are relatively disincentivized to do it. Why? Because the investment for, commercializing, a certified product is so high. And then once you make that investment, you have to then focus on, maximizing your profit. And that means that your assembly lines have to be running nonstop, right? And so when you need to, I guess optimize for, filling your assembly lines, you're disincentivized to innovate because it requires more investment, and it eats into your ability to be profitable, in selling your systems, but what I'm seeing lately is that, this interesting shift is that tomorrow's operators and end users, they're starting to drive some demand for capabilities. They're starting to drive demand for, say, our system, PilotEye. We're finding that it's the operators that are saying, we want this, and we want you to deliver this. And, we're working along the value chain in a way that we didn't expect to be operating along the value chain and traditionally they would apply pressure on the air framer in the avionics OEM in order to integrate and we're seeing some very interesting cases where, they're saying, no, I'm just going to work with you directly. I think one example could be, let's see, Air Methods with Skyrise, right? And in, in that way, I mean that, this is not something, a deal that's including Garmin. It's not a deal that's including the air framer. This is a company that is, delivering directly to, an operator. I think that is relatively new. now how we see this shifting the value as well is, I think that in driving in this direction, this trend, it is potentially going to lead to the hardware, essentially being democratized in a way that the value becomes the software versus the hardware. One example is that there was a time where in operations, just having a camera was huge you had all this additional situational. awareness with a specific kind of camera. Now, once you apply artificial intelligence to it, suddenly the operator's like, No, it's the AI. It's the insights that are delivered from the AI that's where all the value is. And, I think that this is going to be an interesting next, decade in seeing how the traditional avionics OEMs and airframers react to this. another example in consumer electronics is, everyone's, PC, at least ones that have Intel people have a sticker that says Intel inside. No one knows why that even matters, right? So people know Intel because they knew the sticker that was on their computer. but where they saw the value was in Microsoft, right? they see the value in Microsoft. They see the value in Apple, which is, mostly, on the OS and the applications that are built on top of the OS, but not realizing that there are certain functions, For instance, remember when there was a time where you would be typing up a paper on Microsoft Word and your computer goes out and you are screwed. You've lost everything if you did not do a save, right? It was a function in the silicon that enabled the software, to do continuous saves, move, a current instance into, non volatile memory and keep that such that when you turn your computer back on, you can go and get your document. Well, that, that was the Intel inside that, that enabled that. and I think that we're driving in a direction that might look the same way on, the, avionics side and then aerospace side.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, my question, you can answer or not answer any of these questions, but is 80 percent of your revenue today coming from GA\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And two three, four years from now, how will that change?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it'll still be mostly GA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And 10 years from now, what percentage of revenue do you think will be from advanced air mobility?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, 10 years from now, Advanced Air Mobility? it will be larger than the first five years? Haha, it, that's a good question. again, I think, I do believe this goes back to our first question, that, it, we, there will be revenue that is because of advanced air mobility. In fact, I think that if we are successful, it'll be a large amount and, by successful, I mean, that we are directly addressing the cost, we're directly addressing the, resource efficiency and able, to introduce systems that, are commercially viable because there is some level of automation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In order for us to get to level 4 and 5 and DAL A and B, what's the greatest limiting factor? Is it your ability to be able to create the capabilities to be at level 4 or 5? Or are there other factors that you think would be limitations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I... I don't know that it's necessarily a technological problem. I do think that it's a regulatory issue. There's also parts of it that is, even a perception problem. so many people think AI and they think Terminator. And, we're like, you can also use AI to do boring stuff, just identify non cooperative traffic, right? And so... It's the responsibility of folks like Daedalean, and we're taking this on directly. It's our responsibility to, not, integrate AI and applications that just don't need it, right? And for PilotEye... If it's cooperative traffic, it outputs ADS B. That's great, right? But we provide additional, value in using the AI just for non cooperative traffic. use the technology very wisely and where things are working, take advantage of that. We do believe that, AI enhanced autonomy is the best chance of operating, in environments that are not so constrained that they might completely eat away your economic viability in a way that your operational constraints are so great that you can't scale or, you can only operate for these very specific con ops that turn out to, oh, by the way, they are, low margin or low volume, or they don't scale themselves. Right. So we try to really pay attention to that. And, we take the approach of where there is a technology that exists and it works, we want to do that. And we start with how can AI augment that and support that to ensure that, it enables, more freedom in the way that you can operate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:14:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>5, 10, 15 years from now, paint a picture, if you could briefly, just paint a picture of the level 4, level 5 automation, what's a high probability future look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, there will be cases of level four automation in very constrained operating environments. in 10 years, I think that there will be, less constraints, possibly still mostly fixed route, automation, in some specific con ops, and potentially there might be one or two con ops that, are fully autonomous, again, in very constrained, operating environment. 15 years, I think that's closer where we start seeing some real scale and commercial viability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you're saying, at the same time, that's probably the future of autonomy for advanced air mobility as well, and you're saying that's the viability of advanced air mobility on the same timeline, given your initial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>comments. Right. the tech needs to be proven out and, our company, we're proving out the tech in today's airspace in GA, we don't take the approach that automation and autonomy is an all or nothing, kind of proposition. We say that, we can address this by, leveraging the technology in today's airspace in, limited ways, augmenting the, human pilot in, some ways that then by the time, Urban Air Mobility is ready to scale the technology has also been proven out and has had years of certification credit in order to be proven out and then integrated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can Daedalean meet its financial objectives at just level one and two levels of automation in the next five years?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I believe so.

And there is a commercial need for that, right? We have IP, that we are developing all so that we can just deliver, the, machine learn systems.
