For those of you who've been listening to many of our last several podcasts discussions, especially those with Rob Britton and Jeff Luckett, you'll find our discussion with Kevin a perfect follow on. After discussing areas where some may disagree with Kevin, we launch into an overview of electric aviation. And the industry that blossomed due to its introduction. Kevin also discusses that the electric-only industry hasn't seen the battery progress that many had hoped, which has pushed back the timelines of many fully dedicated electric vehicles. We also discuss how electric only vehicles especially eVTOL have more limited near term use cases. We then talk about hybrid propulsion versus electric propulsion. We discuss what parts of hybrid propulsion are changing the fastest today, and it's different and unique use cases. We then discuss why an operator in regional air mobility would select an electric vehicle versus what some would consider the more obvious choice of hybrid electric propulsion. We delve a bit deeper into regional air mobility and how overall electrification may increase the use of regional air mobility. We discuss the pluses and minuses of pure electrification hybrid and traditional aircraft on regional air mobility as well. Kevin wraps up our discussion with some great advice for our innovators and entrepreneurs. Kevin, thanks for joining us for a terrific discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Kevin Noertker, as you profitably innovate in The Vertical Space. Kevin Noertker is co-founder and CEO of Ampaire. Over the past eight years, Kevin and his team have pioneered practical, compelling electrified flight through the upgrade of existing aircraft types. In 2019, they flew the world's largest hybrid electric aircraft. In 2020 and 2021 they deployed and demonstrated electrified flight with multiple airlines across the globe. With over 23,000 miles flown hybrid and 12 plus regulatory flight approvals across three countries to date, they're a leader in hybrid electric aviation. Prior to Ampaire, Kevin contributed engineering and program management expertise to advanced aircraft and satellite technology development programs at Northrop Grumman and as a research fellow at Caltech and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An entrepreneur at heart, Kevin is driven to apply the science and engineering disciplines of large aerospace organizations to pressing environmental problems here on Earth.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, Kevin, welcome.

The first is, we're in sustainable aviation and there's a lot of talk about new design planes and new markets, eVTOL and, high speed new design jets. And first is, I believe that we need to start with propulsion rather than airframe design. And there's a whole lot of good that you can do with new airframe designs, but novel propulsion is how we've seen these transformative moments progress in the past, whether that's the dawn of powered flight or the jet age. And I think you need to get the propulsion right before you start doing the transformative vehicle designs. There'll be a lot of people out there that might disagree with me on that one. Number two is that,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, I'll just, if I could jump in. I had a very senior transportation leader call me last week and say exactly\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>that's great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After listening to so many of our podcasts, he called me up and said, I want to talk about propulsion. And then I, as we were preparing for this, I was thinking, Oh, wow, this is perfect timing. So at least there's one person out there who agrees\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I appreciate that. Well, he and I should grab coffee sometime. I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp>great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And to add this strikes me as perhaps more commonly held view than perhaps you are alluding to. All the new technology waves in aviation revolve around or are enabled by new propulsion. So what is it about this particular statement that, the industry disagrees with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's the idea that you need to do the new airframe design with the new propulsion in the first embodiment. Ampaire over the years has gotten a lot of pushback from industry stakeholders about doing upgrades of existing aircraft types. But you can't capture the full opportunity, they say, by upgrading an existing plane, you really need distributed electric propulsion, or you need the new airflow augmentation, or your vertical lift features, and that they believe that those features are going to drive the adoption dynamic, and that propulsion retrofits which is the path Ampaire has taken, is not a sufficient starting place. I think that's where the differentiation comes in. Because certainly eVTOL, let's take as an example, requires novel propulsion. what I'm saying is we can decouple those as a first step. Not to belittle the benefits that you would get from a clean sheet design, or maybe it's ultra short takeoff and landing performance. But the fact that designing a plane around propulsion that is not yet certified, that does not yet exist, is a recipe for having to redesign that plane half a dozen times. And we've already seen people burn a lot of capital going through that path this turn of the wheel. But if you just look in history, I mean, this is new design planes that didn't do it around existing propulsion. That's one of the big gotchas in the, in the design space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And there was another thing that you wanted to flag.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This is going one layer down there for propulsion. Hybrid electric is the only approach that makes sense right now. There are many exciting technologies. Obviously, fully electric is a dream many of us have. There's some corner cases where fully electric might work. There are a lot of people pushing hydrogen, but the reality is just like on the ground. Hybrid electric is going to lead, it is the gateway technology to this future. And I think it's going to be the gateway technology for decades.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I didn't expect a different answer from you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'm talking about, anything with commercial relevance, where operating flexibility, that is range, payload, airports that you can fly to and from, anywhere in the economics, anywhere that matters, and you need to get to scale, hybrid electric is what'll get you there.

And, and hybrid doesn't place any uncontrollable bets.

Why is it that the industry doesn't think that hybrid is the way to go?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think back to when we founded Ampaire. And I think back to a lot of the people in this industry who have such deep passion for making a positive impact on the world around us. And those core motivations for many are about usually one of two things. Either they care deeply about the environment and they want a true zero emissions solution. And that forces their designs into a fully electric or, a strong hybrid where you're flying fully electric for some period of time, or a hydrogen where they can claim a, zero carbon emissions in flight, if it's a fuel cell. And so what you see is this desire to have a pure carbon, remedy. And that causes people to not prefer the hybrid electric type approaches or these hybrid approaches where, you know, 50 percent fuel savings, 50 to 70 percent in our vehicles is phenomenal, but it's not zero. And if you're here on only principle and unwilling to look at anything but the pure solution, then that would bias you against it. The second is, there are some people who are pushing toward this idea of you have to start with the absolute simplest, simplest possible architecture, even if it's not possible today. And electric is phenomenally simple. And the maintenance costs are super low, and in theory you can get the economics to play out, depending on your battery assumptions. And if you believe, if you have certain optimisms in that area, then you don't want to give yourself the complexity or the crutch of having to do the partial via hybrid solution. And I think that keeps some people away from it because they say, oh, batteries will get there. Like, let's just wait around for those. But I think they miss the point that if you can serve, 10 times the market size by using hybrid electric, and you're saving half the fuel burn on that. That's, do the math, it's five times the positive impact of a few or zero emissions on that one tenth of a market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Let's talk about electric aviation. Zoom out a little bit, catch us up on some of the major milestones in electric aviation over the last several years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, electric aviation has had some pretty amazing progress in the last decade or so. The earliest companies in this industry were founded in the, 2010s but very few were talking about them at that point in time. You had the starting of, the NASA X 57 program. By the time Ampaire was founded in 2016, there still really weren't that many companies that were publicly acknowledged doing work in this space. Since then, we've seen this, this, blossoming of ideas, of concepts, I remember, the first time, I think, Peter, you were, you might have even been there at the, Uber Elevate Conference out in Dallas in 2017. There's this industry that built up around the enthusiasm for electrification. And then you saw hundreds, I believe the number peaked at over 700 different projects in this space. A lot of ideas, a lot of people who really get excited about designing airplanes. And, want to go through the features. So, big milestones. You've had first flights, whether those are the flights of the Pipistrel Alpha Electro, or ultimately that being delivered to customers around the world. You have the first flights of various development program aircraft, Ampaire's first flight in 2019, and, subsequent iterations, for example, our, Caravan flight in, 2022. The industry's also made progress from, simple demonstration of flight capability to very specific capabilities. So in eVTOL, the progress of transitioning from vertical lift to fixed wing flight has been a, a big challenge where still only a handful of companies have safely made that transition or done so with a pilot on board. These are critical milestones that will drive confidence in adoption and ability to gain regulatory approvals on the, on the operations. You've seen some incremental progress along the battery energy density. standpoint, so a lot of folks are waiting for batteries to have significantly higher watt hours per kilogram, so the gravimetric energy density in the lithium ion batteries in particular. And we've seen some modest progress on that and some really amazing announcements. Some groups who are in the chemistry side trying to, get up toward, past 500 watt hours per kilogram, targeting 1, 000 watt hours per kilogram, pretty audacious goals. I think, the industry hasn't yet seen, as significant of progress as many had hoped, and that's, that's pushing back timelines for entry into service of the fully electric, fully electric vehicles. And then from a certification standpoint, some pretty big milestones. Back to 2018, where we were kicking off a ASTM committee around electric vehicle chargers, through all the SAE committees or other industry groups working together on certification. While these might not be the visible milestones that hit the press, there's certainly the milestones and progress that help move the industry forward. And so, watching folks get their first certification bases established, or get a, get means of compliance agreed upon, or special conditions, moving forward, ultimately looking, I think here in the next few years, we'll get the first full, regulatory approvals for commercial operation. And, and each of those are some of the very meaningful milestones that are, happening real time and coming up soon.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the surprises for me was, the lack of certification events following Pipistrel's EASA certification of their, Velis Electro aircraft in the LSA category that was back in the summer of 2020. And then earlier this year, I think in March, the FAA issued an LSA airworthiness exemption for that same aircraft. But here we are four years later and no other electric aircraft has been certified. Why do you think that's the case? What's the bottleneck? about the.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think the, there are a few things. One is, the regulatory basis for certification. And the Pipistrel products didn't fully open up the Part 23 or the vertical lift, certification arena. it was in a different category initially. And I think that while it made progress and maybe others could have taken their products through that same, the, you know, the identical regulatory pathway, many of the products that are out there that we most were paying attention to are in Part 23 or the vertical lift category, which was not as fully opened up through the Pipistrel application. Think second was a bit of the dynamics in the market, so with the pandemic in 2020, I think a lot of milestones were dragged out a bit. 2021, money was easy, and I think that meant that money went to moonshots. So easy money doesn't mean it goes to practical, near term, near term wins. And so I think that a lot of the money that was being invested in late 2020 and throughout 2021 was going toward long horizon plays. So purposefully not aiming at super near term strategies. And I think that overfunded those, and we've seen many get significant funding, but then burning through it, and I think it underfunded the pragmatic strategies. and so what you saw was further pressures on or delays to the timelines for entry into service for those that might not have been as flashy, but were, were just making the, the next increment of meaningful progress. And then we've seen the retrenchment of the markets where now there's a bit of a recoil. I think, the industry's at risk of losing credibility. Given all the claims that were made and failed to be lived up to, whether that's certain timelines, or product performance, or cost metrics for the products. And so, I think the industry, in particular the capital allocators, may be licking their wounds from those moonshot projects that didn't play out, which doesn't help again those that are near term. What it does is it pulls back more capital away from everything, and so if you're looking at that as a lowering tide, each of these dynamics I think is has pressed away from certification milestones that we might have otherwise hoped to see more rapidly after the Pipistrel's early successes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what about the maturity of the enabling technologies themselves and the certifiability of the motors and batteries. What's the status there? And I was recently catching up with another founder and we started talking about this and it was surprising to hear how the regulatory bodies are trying to apply traditional propulsion system requirements to electric motors. So for instance, I think there's a requirement somewhere in internal combustion engines that they need to be able to run for, I think it's five minutes in max rated power, whereas an electric motor reaches its thermal limit, a lot quicker, maybe within, two minutes or so before needing to throttle back. And so that is one contentious issue, allegedly as is the example of having dual magnetos in ICE engines, and does that translate into, you know, double architecture in electric motors, all of that increasing mass, increasing budget, and really not making that cost equation as favorable as initially expected. Do you have any insights into those aspects of how the bottlenecks are being tackled at the certifiability and the maturity of the technologies?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think that this gets to one of the really critical and core risks in the industry, which is the supply chain and the ability to not just invent something, but to produce it reliably many times at a good economics. That's really what builds the markets here. I think the regulatory bodies are trying to adapt to what they know. And, those adaptations, whether it's the Part 23 rewrite, which adapted combustion type expectations to, an opener, larger net for what kind of technologies could actually be used to meet those requirements. But in the details, they're still looking for that familiarity. So what's your mean time between failure? How long can you run at full power? What are the failure modes and effects, and making sure that you're going through the detail on that? This is the, the specifics that you get into when putting together your program certification plan, your means of compliance, or ultimately going through the testing for your, Type Certificate or STC, and it is, it's really where the rubber hits the road in the industry. I don't think that all the answers are there yet. I think there are the early entrance, certainly Ampaire is, at least to our knowledge, the only company working on a hybrid electric propulsion system certification program actively with the FAA. And so this means that we are, we're clearing many of those open questions actively with them and collaboratively with them. It also means that we have, expectations upon our supply chain that, emerge over time if something, for example, with the FAA, brings up or highlights a requirement that we did not expect. As you talked about with the motors. for these questions about redundancy, there's what you could expect as a technologist, like you'd understand the technology and you believe this to be true, some level of safety, let's say, but that does not mean that will be accepted on the first pass through certification. And in fact, I think that the first paths through certification are going to be relatively risk averse and risk managed in those setting a higher bar for redundancy, not giving you credit for levels of safety that you think you might deserve. So, case in point, for the lithium ion batteries, no matter what you do to the cells, no matter how you package those cells into your modules, no matter what physical, interconnect or disconnect controls you have that might mitigate thermal runaway, or physical barriers that might mitigate propagation or software layers that are on top of all of that. The belts and suspenders and layers of safety. At the end of the day, the FAA, probably rightly so at this stage, requires you to show that you have physical barriers that if you force the battery into thermal runaway, the vehicle will be safe. So you don't get, you don't get actual credit for everything below that. You need ultimate safety and then all the other stuff that you thought was going to be sufficient. And these are, again, I don't think it should be surprising to anybody that the earliest, earliest applications, we're going to take a, the most risk managed approach. But what it means is that when you're a battery engineer on your fully electric vehicle, you're now doubling the weight of all these additional systems when you thought you could get there just with a really good BMS algorithm. And so what it drives is the decisions and it drives the, ultimately the designs into corners that might not be viable given some of those early assumptions. This is why we pushed again toward hybrid electric, because with a battery pack, a third the size of a Tesla pack and able to take on the extra weight and the payload hit along with it for all these physical layers of safety, we still have phenomenal performance on our system. and I think that these are, these are areas where the industry is trying to navigate alongside the regulations to mature, the solutions and the risk, together.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, what electric aircraft are selling in meaningful numbers today that you're impressed by?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you say stelling, I'm gonna assume you mean where there's a cash transaction and somebody ends up with an airplane. in their hangar at the end of it, and right now the only airplanes that are selling, are the Pipistrel aircraft at this time. There are many organizations placing orders, pre orders for, eventual deliveries, but at this stage, very minimal on the actual sales in this market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Kevin, what are you seeing as the FAA's thought process for how industry is going to incorporate improvements in hybrid electric propulsion systems into these aircraft in the coming years. These aircraft are long lived assets. Batteries still seem to be improving pretty markedly over the years. Motor technology as well. So if you certify something, on the one hand, you're locked in at that point in time, are they going to use an STC method for bringing improvements in? Or is there something that is even more fluid for allowing that, that they have in mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's a really good point because the technology base is moving so much faster than the time scale of a vehicle life, right? These aircraft last 40 years. And the, batteries are improving on the, on the order of every two to three years, you'd expect people wanting an upgrade of their battery pack to the next generation, a little bit like people might want their new iPhone every few years. The way you go about certifying your product matters. And if you wrap everything into the type certificate, then you need to amend or update the type certificate when anything changes. And so that would require a supplemental type certificate for certain types of changes. Generally, propulsion systems, propellers, or airframe changes require a new type certificate, or a amendment, or a STC, supplemental type certificate. There are things you can change on an airplane without having to go get an STC. You could replace a conforming part with an equivalent part. You're able to show certain equivalent levels of safety. And so there are efforts to try to find ways that these components which would be replaced over time, let's use the batteries as an example. Batteries degrade over the cycles of use, and every few years you want to replace those. You have to go get an STC for the new battery pack are you able to use a TSO type of process? Basically a lighter version of those approvals. And it really depends on exactly how that battery pack was incorporated into the vehicle level certification. So is it part of the engine? Is it part of the aircraft? Is it a safety of flight critical component? And then as technology improves, One of the things in aviation is you lock yourself into the parts that you designed and that an in any change in that part requires a change in your regulatory approval. So as batteries improve, how do you go through that certification pathway? Again, generally, what I think the industry will see is we guarantee equivalent performance while providing improved performance. And that all you're doing when you're meeting the existing regulatory waterline is you're saying we're at least as good as we were previously, and we haven't changed any flight characteristics. The question will be, when do you want to take credit for that? When do you want to allow the operator to plan a longer route? You can give them more energy, which gives them more safety, or maybe it gives them more flexibility on how many, how many flight miles they can perform or when they need to recharge at the other end. But it might not be part of the underlying. certification, performance capability of the vehicle that you've, that you've sought from the regulatory body. Now, this is a nuance, but it's the difference between having to go through the full cert program for the new tech or just increasing performance but taking credit for an equivalent level of safety. One specific point here, in our hybrid system, I have triplicate redundancy in our hybrids. We are phenomenally safe, and I believe safer than a traditional combustion engine would be, where it's a single point failure for the traditional engine. And in our, in Ampaire's system, we have redundancy, two layers of redundancy in the combustion engine. And then also this independent electric system, which is able to carry you further as well. But am I going to get credit for anything more than a single engine capability? Probably not. and that's understandable, at least initially. And I think over time, what people, what you'll get is additional credit for those things from the regulatory body. And in the interim, when new tech, motors, or batteries come out, It'll be at equivalent levels of safety as what was there previously.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What components of the hybrid electric propulsion system are changing the fastest right now, be it the battery systems, the motors themselves, power electronics, or something else? What do you see as the fastest changing or evolving?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, the fastest changing components historically have been those which had the benefit of riding the coattails of other industries. Aviation, as big as we love it and believe it is, is much smaller than, as a market driver, than other forms of ground transportation. And so we have been the recipients of rapid technology improvement across lithium ion batteries as energy density, volume density and cost get brought down. The, the motors have been a, truly the underlying enabling factor in many of these cases. So the power density of motors is pretty phenomenal compared to where it was a decade ago. And we still see companies that are, and we work closely with companies that are pioneering in this space. And you can start, you're getting great efficiencies and really high, power density out of these motors. Where, certainly Ampaire has locked most of the components for our launch product, but we have a flying testbed where we're able to bring in new technologies, where we first flew a silicon carbide inverter, when we have brought in new motors, inverters, and energy storage tech. And it's really in those, the motors and batteries that most people are pushing firmly for innovation, and then a bit in the efficiency of the power electronics, but a lot of that currently is, seems like it's lab scale technology. And while our work with ARPA E and NASA enables us to make that move even faster, I hesitate to, to think that lab technology today is going to rapidly enter commercialization anytime soon. I think we've seen a consistent trend that timelines for those developments take much longer than, than the, the technology teams would, would have originally anticipated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is aviation going to continue to benefit from advances in the automotive industry around the batteries that they use? Or is there going to be a fork in the road where the needs of aviation diverge from what the auto industry is pushing towards?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, the auto industry used to have range anxiety. But then battery energy density got to the point that you can drive hundreds of miles. There's a sufficient charging network. So I don't see the energy density being what automotive is optimizing for anymore. Really, I think automotive is going to continue optimizing for cost, and we've seen that over the last few years. Bringing the cost of an EV down is the driver for adoption more than bringing the range up. Whereas in aviation, we're still in that bringing the range up is the requirement. And so this is a divergence in the optimization goals for the technology coming out of automotive. Now the question would be, even if the goals are different, is the state of the art, the state of knowledge and capability, is that going to improve? As folks go toward lower cost, are we going to also see emergent benefits for aviation? Absolutely. As people do innovation and build new types of electric machines, it's no longer just about what is Tesla using in a Roadster, it's about where the larger vehicles, your mid duty and heavy duty trucks, what are the power requirements for those vehicles. What are the energy densities required for those? And so it's this expanding fringe of requirements that I think will also drive a, an alignment in, in, in emerging technologies with what aviation is looking for. But the core of a ground car is, is less likely to directly align with aviation than it did over the last decade in my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Are the batteries that you would design around for your hybrid electric conventional takeoff and landing airplane, are they the same ones that you would design around for a VTOL aircraft? And the reason I ask is that, an additional difference that I've, come to appreciate with batteries for VTOL aircraft is the power output demand on them, especially requiring high power output at the end of the flight as the aircraft transitions back into vertical flight to make its approach at the landing pad. That's a particularly, stringent requirement on the battery system. For what you're doing, I don't know, maybe that still exists. Maybe it's the same battery. Maybe you, you can, use the same tech, but how do you think about that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a nuance that most of the world, unlike you, Peter, most of the world doesn't catch the nuance between the different types of batteries. The power density versus the energy density needs to be tailored for the application. And what's interesting is you gave two examples. I'll add one more in there around fully electric airplanes. So let's take your eVTOL, which is fully electric, but requires huge amounts of power at a low state of charge at the end of flight, right? So you need a power cell there. Then you have a fully electric airplane, which has a large amount of batteries. And so actually a relatively low C rate, especially if it's conventional takeoff and landing. You're not really draining where, for those listening, the C rate is the rate of charge or discharge. as a proportion of the total pack size. And so that, when you have a really large pack, relative to your pack size, you're not discharging that rapidly. And so those can be energy cells, because you don't really need that high power C rate. But then you go to a hybrid electric plane. And as I mentioned, our pack is about a third the size of a Tesla pack. These are pretty small, actually. When you come through our hangar, you see this battery is big enough to fly a Caravan, really. And that is because in a hybrid, you use the battery differently than you would in the fully electric. A small battery pack, but you still have pretty high power for takeoff and climb. Again, now you need a higher C rate. You need more of a power cell. And so for each application, you do actually have different requirements for the type of the type of chemistry you might consider, the, tailoring of that cell between energy and power, certainly the life cycle economics of the pack, the degradation over time, you might have great power or great energy, but if you only cycle 400 times, then are you useful? There's a, there's, there are all these pieces that go into the details of selecting a battery. And this is the challenge that some companies who are trying to do a one size fits all, cell or module for everybody, need to hit the high waterline or miss the, miss the mark on their, their certain markets. And this is again, why I think it's so important to have a more flexible design where let's say that I need to increase the size of my pack a little bit because I'm not getting exactly what I wanted out of my supply chain, where we can handle that. it's not ideal. We don't desire it, but when you have a, an approach, which is just a little bit more flexible than, the pure heart requirement, I think most eVTOL folks. A lot of the ones who have decided to in house their battery development is because they realize they will not get precisely what they need from anyone else, and they have to tailor it directly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Given the advantages of the hybrid propulsion to electric, why would the eVTOL or the electric plane companies go purely electric versus hybrid? What would be some of their rationale?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Number one is, that I hear from them is on the emissions. They want to be able to say they can operate fully zero emissions. Number two is a statement around, around complexity, the economics of maintenance and that's a, it's an interesting argument which, without being deep into the weeds, it's hard to validate or, dispute. All the weeds that I've been in have shown that fully electric still has a way to go before it's economically more viable. But those are usually why I see, that it can, there are other ancillary features, like, for example, noise characteristics are important for communities. Oftentimes the reason communities get upset with aviation is because of the noise. And hybrid electric does not fully eliminate the noise profile, to the extent that full, that fully electric does. Fully electric planes, if you've ever flown in one, it's like being in a glider a lot of the time. It's really beautiful. and I think that some people have hung their hats on the sound, and frankly, to their credit, if you're an eVTOL talking about flying to the city center of Manhattan, you better be thinking about sound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's not how people are going to scale in the next several years. At the end of the day, regional air mobility most likely is how a vehicle is going to scale in the next, let's face it, 5 to 10 years. And given regional air mobility, given the requirements of the vehicles, I'm guessing that hybrid is going to be the, the limitations of hybrid are not nearly as impactful as they would be if they go into city center. And how many city center flights are going to be occurring in the next five to ten years, and especially at scale. So my guess is a lot of people right now listening are saying, hybrid's the way to go. Why would they not be saying that, especially as we start to talk about regional air mobility?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so it depends on who they are. Let's say that you are an eVTOL developer. We know many. And you've spent the last half a decade, investing how many hundreds of millions of dollars into your pure electric design. That is tailored, that every inch of it is optimized specifically for your fully electric operation. You don't have volume, you don't have weight, you would have to redesign your plane in order to integrate a hybrid electric system. And I know this because I've worked with those groups, and we have shown that you can apply a hybrid electric system in. But shoehorning a hybrid into a combustion plane is one thing, that's where we enter the market. Shoehorning a hybrid into something which was designed for a little battery pack, is a completely different beast. And I think a lot of these developers have gotten so deep into their fully electric application that they don't have the payload and volume capacity to take on the hybrid electric into their current designs. And so,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But let's move on. Let's say, Kevin, sorry, great answer, but let's talk about the operators who are going to be purchasing these vehicles. Why would they consider a fully, let's again, let's step into regional air mobility. Why would they consider a fully electric plane with its, with some of its limitations? Obviously some pluses, but the hybrid I would assume is still less noisy, for example, than a traditional combustion engine. Why would they consider a fully electric plane rather than a hybrid for regional air mobility in the next 5 to 10 years? What's their rationale? Put yourself in the position of an operator who has to make that decision.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so I would ask, what's the risk? Am I, what, truly, what's the risk? The risk that I put down an order? Even if it's binding, I'm sure there are tons of outs that if it, if this doesn't meet my performance requirements, I don't have to buy it. And probably if I'm putting money down, it's going into an escrow that it can come back to me. Most aren't putting money down for the fully electric, type orders that are out there. And so I would look at it and say, I could place an order for a fully electric plane and if it doesn't pan out, great. If all of the Swiss cheese of good things going right doesn't occur, I probably got a boost to my marketing and brand along the way, and I'm not out any money at the end of the day, I could probably still buy a hybrid down the road. Now, the reality is a lot of these groups are falling behind in our order books, so, potentially they won't be as, as, as early as they would like, but if magic happens and the performance is what people would love electric to be, then I get the electric plane and everything that I needed. And so I think it's a risk posture that, the benefit of placing a signaling order outweighs the risk. And the key for me, as Kevin and with my Ampaire hat on, is those folks still place orders for hybrids. Right? Like, when I talk to folks, they're like, Kevin, this is the first thing that I actually have confidence is going to come to market. I'm going to place an order for this. And what's silly is some of those people still say, and by the way, we don't want to talk publicly about this because our brand is still like fully zero emissions, but we know that this is probably going to come in first. And so we'd like to take part in it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, in what way is certifying a hybrid configuration easier or more difficult compared to certifying a battery electric?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the hybrid, one of the reasons it's easier is the safety case. The safety case for our system in the, condition where you assume you have an issue with the electric vehicle system, which is really what is the novel, parts of the technology. If you're in a hybrid electric condition like ours, you fall back onto a combustion engine and you fly home safely. We have full cruise capacity. With our combustion engine, so there's no degradation or risk to that operation if you shut off the electric system in flight. You can't say that for a fully electric, or hydrogen, for example, system that, when you have an issue, maybe you have redundancy in the battery packs, but the level of safety that you can, that you can, take credit for in the hybrid is quite a bit higher. And, and certifying that is, is we believe going to be faster and lower complexity and lower cost than going fully electric. The second is around the size and, requirements on each of the subcomponents. So whether it's the batteries or the motors, when you look at the reduced consequence of an issue, you can also, take different or take a different balance on the, the probability of certain issues occurring. And, and so the holistic risk analysis for the, the safety case, we have a little bit more flexibility. And that means that flexibility translates into the supply chain and our ability to move a bit more quickly and getting those, getting those technologies through the certification program.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the expected efficiency gain of a hybrid electric conventional aircraft versus the efficiency gain that we are seeing from hybrid electric automobiles? And is there a difference? And if so, why? And then we can get into efficiency gain that you would see from just like retrofitting an existing airplane versus designing an airplane around hybrid electric. Especially for the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft because going to electric propulsion when you want to do distributed electric propulsion for vertical flight or for electric STOL, okay, we get that, right? There's a capability there that's earning its way onto the aircraft. But if you are going for conventional takeoff and landing, and you are looking for an efficiency gain, what can we expect to see?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the efficiency of these hybrid systems, and I, I see hybrid as this gateway technology that as the underlying technology improves directionally toward fully electric, all of it will first get proven out in these hybrid electric systems, conditions. One of the, one of the great drivers for adoption of hybrid electric is the fuel efficiency of the systems that, that we and have already demonstrated and have been flying tens of thousands of miles so far in our hybrid systems and demonstrated a 50% fuel burn reduction. During takeoff and climb cycle, we're up closer to 70 percent fuel burn reduction. So these are actual measurements, right? This is not just an Excel spreadsheet model. This is empirical data and is the kind of benefit that you can get in certain embodiments of hybrid electric systems. So this is, pretty, pretty significant fuel savings, even when you're looking at the, the opportunity of hybrid-electric on the ground, where, call it maybe a 40 percent fuel savings, to 50 percent fuel savings on the ground. And it's all about the specific architecture of the system that drives the beneficial economics. Fuel is one of the largest, if not the largest, operating cost for most airlines. And so the fuel burn reduction then drives a positive cycle for the economic viability of new routes and market growth and higher frequencies of service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What phase of flight are these efficiencies realized the most?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, if you're just looking at a pure percentage basis of fuel savings, takeoff and climb is where you're getting the biggest boost from the electric system in our current architecture. There are lots of different hybrid architectures, and we've got a few of them, but what we're launching into product, into market with is a integrated parallel hybrid architecture where we use the electric system effectively as a boost during the high power phases of flight and the combustion engine as a baseline load of power for the cruise and, and across the rest of the flight. So you get up to 70 percent fuel savings, during that takeoff and climb cycle. And then it levels off toward about 50 percent fuel savings during the cruise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I see. What's the state of the art in some of the metrics on the battery side? We talked a little bit about, well, we didn't talk numbers, but gravimetric specific energy density, both at the cell and the pack level, the cycle life that state of the art batteries are achieving, and the, battery pack cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the, the batteries, so watt hours per kilogram is the metric that we in the industry normally uses to measure the energy density. The target most are aiming for is right around 400 watt hours per kilogram at a pack level. We're not close to that today. When you're looking at the packs today, you're at, right around 200 watt hours per kilogram really depends on your cooling system and where you draw the dotted line on the battery pack itself and what you include as weight versus don't include as kind of wet versus dry weight for the pack. The cells themselves, are, I remember a few years ago seeing cells that were cresting through the 200s of watt hours per kilogram, and then you get folks who are talking about 300, even into the 400 watt hour per kilogram cells. I think I've seen announcements about cells that are even significantly higher than that. Unfortunately, I'm not an expert in the kind of the lab type chemistry that goes into these batteries and the art of understanding where along the long tail of getting from lab into production you are and in measuring the number of years remaining is very challenging. And so it's hard to tell what, like, state of the art for, for the development of new technologies sounds like it's pretty far ahead in these high watt hours per kilogram. I think the reality is the first battery packs that get adopted into market are going to be at a pack level, maybe even sub 200 watt hours per kilogram, when you're looking full scope, full scope weight of the system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And in terms of cycle life and cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Cycle life and cost are, generally tailored depending on what your application are. So if you've got a more exotic cell, a higher power or energy density, it'll probably have a lower cycle life. I've heard some of our industry peers talking about cycle lives less than a thousand cycles. I don't see how that makes a whole lot of economic sense when you have to be replacing the batteries so, so repeatedly. We think that a 2, 000 to 3, 000 cycles, maybe it's 2, 000 full depth discharge, but you're looking at, you know, that might give you 4, 000 or 5, 000 actual flight cycles on a, on a vehicle, that's not unrealistic when you're not working with the most exotic type cells. And from a cost, I think, we're pretty conservative assuming costs are going to be pretty, pretty high, and it's hard to tell what'll come out in full production once you actually get to scale, but being at$500 per kilowatt hour, I think would be a great outcome for the industry if we were able to get there. And, I wouldn't be surprised if the very first battery packs that came to market were quite a, maybe a multiple higher than that. So maybe a thousand dollars per kilowatt hour. Which gets pretty expensive, especially when you're looking at the very large packs for, for the fully electric vehicles, but is still somewhat manageable with the, with the hybrid electric approach.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to put some business perspective into the conversation and if we use, uh, maybe we can get to ultimately the use case that you are pursuing at Ampaire, but one of the common near term use cases for electric aircraft is often thought of on the conventional side as a flight school trainer aircraft. Now, putting aside that the current range restrictions do not enable flight schools to use electric aircraft for the entirety of the curriculum for flight training, but for most, missions, it's good enough. What I'm interested in is when you actually go down into the weeds that you've been in, how the business case for an electric, fully battery powered aircraft pencils out when you consider the fact that, conventional piston engines are an industry that's been around for decades, benefiting from huge economies of scale, exceptional safety records, it's in the several thousands annual units, a lot of the development and R&amp; D costs have been recovered already. I mean, you're going after a relatively low cost. And I think the engine, replacement on, in this type application is in the 30, 40, 50. maybe 70, 000 per engine, correct me guys, uh, if I'm off. Uh, but at any rate, uh, you have that on the one hand, and then you have an electric, aircraft with a motor that, needs to recover the certification costs and development costs, and is one that every, you know, thousand cycles needs to replace the battery, which can be, I don't know, 80, 000 or whatever the cost is. So when you bake all of these different things, does it really become an attractive option?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So this gets back to your first question around what might the industry disagree with me on, and it is this principle that the economics must make sense in order for people to adopt the products. There are a lot of people out there who assume government subsidies will get us there, or people willing to pay a green premium. And while certain cases that might be true, to hit the scale of adoption that's required, you can't achieve it without really compelling economic benefits for the end user and buyer. So this example that you gave around the, the training, especially in these smaller airplanes, is a great one. The market makes so much sense. The direct operating cost seems so low when you're only taking into account the industrial power that you're using. It's cents on the dollar for OpEx. But when you look whole scale and you're comparing yourself against a, sub 100, 000 airplane with relatively low cost of capital, it's probably fully depreciated, and you're comparing that to a quarter million dollar new build plane that has these unknowns around the cost of batteries over time, or the cost of the infrastructure to charge. The economics are really called into question, especially before you get to full scale. And I think that's, rightly should be acknowledged as one of the big risks for adoption. The performance of the systems, especially in training, I think a blended fleet where, cross country flights might have to be in a hybrid or combustion, but fully electric can be done for the, a few touch and goes here or there, or just familiarization. That's, I think that's completely reasonable to solve the problem. But the economics, especially in smaller airplanes, are pretty challenging. When you look at the economics as you scale to larger planes, it similarly, anywhere that it's not an operator of, high frequency becomes challenging because to earn back the capital cost of the system, you really need high utilization. And, you're not generally going against an option which is a premium priced combustion versus a premium priced electric. It's probably a relatively low cost combustion versus a premium priced electric, and I think that will be a friction point for adoption for those types of applications.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, if you were to argue for a fully battery electric aircraft, what is the right initial use case that will generate this flywheel moment where it makes sense and it also is a good path to get to scale, which will have benefits down the road with economies of scale and the supply chain, et cetera, et cetera. What use case gets the industry going, if not flight training.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think the use case that gets the electrification industry going is using those technologies in full scale applications. So it's taking the exact same batteries, the motors, the power electronics, These certification bases, taking those and by applying them into the hybrid electric applications, you build the industry base. You build the production volumes. You solve those economic challenges tied in with the supply chain and the certification and the market's readiness to adopt. Tying in with the economics of the full scope view, you start to bring those costs down to a point where all of a sudden those same technologies, those same suppliers that are making batteries for the hybrid or making motors for the hybrid, when the economics of scale get to a point, those same suppliers will be the supply base for the fully electric applications where, the opportunities are vast for, where you might want to fly a fully electric plane, whether it's short hop island hopping for commercial cargo flights, commercial drones, or for eVTOL cargo, or for pilot training. There are a lot of areas where you might want the fully electric. And I think the way to get the industry to scale is by scaling the underlying components rather than scaling the end solution of fully electric. And that's when I talk about hybrid as this gateway technology, I truly believe I'm helping all the electric, maybe even helping some hydrogen out there. Like because we're maturing the industry, we're maturing the supply base and we're getting up to good economics, full scale marketability of these underlying technologies that ultimately can be packaged in the fully electric. And that's I think that's how you get there. In eight and a half years of every waking and sleeping moment thinking about it, this is the pathway that makes sense to me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We just had Rob Britton on a couple weeks ago, our last podcast, and he was talking about regional air mobility, and he was saying that it's conceivable that hybrid or electric aircraft will allow us to be able to get to locations that today are less profitable than using a purely combustion engine aircraft. Talk a little bit about that. I'm guessing that hybrid would be the only solution today, although he did mention, I believe, guys, a 30 passenger electric plane as a potential solution in the near future. But talk about the capabilities for hybrid electric for regional air mobility. What's the near term, long term solution from your perspective, Kevin?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I really enjoyed listening to the episode with Rob and his enthusiasm for regional hybrid electric. You can hear it coming through in the conversation. Love it. And the folks over at Heart who you mentioned a few times, you know doing some really interesting work in trying to open up the regional space. Also in that episode, he had mentioned that this regional space is kind of eroded over the years. I mean, with deregulation and things having to compete just on the economics, economics really didn't make sense to serve a lot of secondary or tertiary markets. And so the service to those markets has gone away. And, that demand still exists, it's just being served by ground transportation, people jumping in their cars instead of flying. If you were able to give an economic alternative, lower cost of operation, being the key adoption driver, then people would potentially choose to fly those routes instead of drive those routes. And I think he was spot on with that and the enthusiasm around regional air mobility. Two areas that I would disagree with the approach, though. One is there's a phenomenal difference between a 19 passenger plane and a 20 passenger plane. While it might look almost the same, it is categorically different, in the literal sense of it, is a different category of airplane between Part 23 and Part 33. And the idea that somebody will open up regional air mobility with a Part 25 plane that is something over 20 passengers, I think, is faulty logic there. I don't think it's going to be, Part 25 is not going to be ready for hybrid electric, fully electric, any novel system for quite some time. Now, I want it to be there, and we're certainly helping the industry get there, and there are companies betting their, livelihood on it, but this is where I would disagree with the approach because we believe Part 23 is where it has to start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, explain for the audience the nuances of the differences.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So there are two major categories for conventional airplanes. One category, which is under Part 23 of the regulations, governs all planes up to 19 passengers or the equivalent weight. Part 25 governs all airplanes, 20 passengers and above. And so when regulations are updated in the industry, they're updated for one category or the other, eventually both. The smaller aircraft category, Part 23, is already positioned with all of the legislation and regulation in place to adopt novel propulsion technologies. The larger category is not in that state yet. It takes a decade of work to make a significant change to regulation in aviation. And I think we have years ahead of us before the large aircraft is ready to adopt novel propulsion technology from a regulatory standpoint. The technology might be there, but I think the regulations are going to lag in that case. So entering market with Part 23, or airplanes that are up to 19 passengers, I think is the fastest way, and frankly the only way we will see commercial adoption this decade. And that maybe in the next decade we'll see, through the proof points of these Part 23 smaller airplanes, we will see that technology leapfrog up into and enable the conversion of those certifications requirements in the larger Part 25 airplanes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Speaking of regional air mobility, wanted to get your thoughts on whether you think that electric aviation is what catalyzes regional air travel, or is there a, simply a thickness of the demand that's an issue that needs to be addressed somehow first. You know, we can take a brief look at history prior to the 1978 deregulation, point to point was the, airline network model, and regional travel was subsidized by the government mostly. Post deregulation, we saw the emergence of hub and spoke and a lot of regional routes were abandoned because they did not make economic sense anymore. So you can look at that to draw the conclusion that, well, actually the demand is there is just a matter of making that air travel economic. And so, that's an argument for the technology's role in disrupting, again, this, segment of the industry. If that's the case, well, first of all, do you think that's the case? And then second of all, do you think that electric aviation is the technology that will make economics appealing or you need to start layering additional things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I absolutely think, electrification is the pathway to making the economics make sense. And the improved economics drives this elasticity, this growth in the market. where we will see increased frequencies on the existing routes, decreased ticket costs as competition goes up on those, and increased accessibility or flights to fringe airports, either in a hub and spoke extension or a point to point model that, that allows more people to have access to air travel. I think adoption will also be driven by in similar economic driver but through cargo. I think the cargo market will be a rapid adopter of good economics and will be serving maybe even before the passengers choose to fly to these areas. Same day and next day delivery of packages is a growing expectation for our global economy and I think that what we'll see is as the economics improve the cargo operators, so, think your, your FedEx's, UPS's, DHL's, and similar around the world are going to be adopting these both to serve the high end communities who, want their Amazon packages in the next day, but also to open up these billion people markets that don't currently have access to the global economy efficiently, whether that's moving agricultural goods or other products, the economic drivers of increasing accessibility for them. So it's not just about U. S. states and cities. I do actually think on the global scale, these economics open up countries, entire regions of the world that are currently isolated from the global aviation ecosystem and economy. And when you look at that as a driver for scale, it's not about you know, 10 percent increase in the people who want to fly to Fresno. It's about a going from a market of zero to a market of again, hundreds of millions of people being served for the first time ever and what that drives. And so I wholeheartedly think that the economics of electrification is what gets us there. It is also on those principles that I think some of the exciting features aren't necessary to get us there. So vertical takeoff and landing, important in some areas, but probably not important for the vast majority. Fully electric and important and beneficial, but not useful if you can't land on that dirt strip in Kenya. Like, you have to have full flexibility, and this is part of the reason why I have such conviction around the regional air mobility being opened up through hybridization, where we don't have any of those infrastructure, range or operational limitations, but give that great economic benefit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Kevin, let's say we had a Part 23 aircraft and we wanted to be able to get more aircraft to cities that are not being well served today. And you're saying Part 23 was the way we'd have to do it today. What's the cost per available seat mile for a conventional aircraft, hybrid and electric? Assuming the three of them, could meet that capability today, what's the relative cost difference between the three?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the difference in CASM between conventional and hybrid, we're looking at really depends on, on exactly how you're operating the plane, right? So it's going to be a range. We're looking at a 20 to 40% savings on your cost per available seat mile. So think, again, depends on how you're flying the plane, going from a dollar per available seat mile down to, 70 cents or there's 60 some odd cents per available seat mile. that kind of a transition in certain cases. Electric's harder because right now when I run the numbers, depends on how you assume battery costs, because batteries are the big replacement cost there, but the, right now it does not in my mind, close economically to go fully electric. Also, it's hard to do the analysis because most of the routes you can't even operate. And then the question comes in on, do I count the grid infrastructure upgrade costs and capex and costs of that capital over time in the analysis, or do I not? So it gets a bit muddy. I don't have numbers specifically on the electric in isolation, for those reasons.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you talked to airlines, who today say those routes are not profitable because of the traditional aircraft? Have you talked to them about your operating costs? Are they saying, if you can get me a 30 to 35 percent reduction, that's a route that becomes profitable?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Yeah, the numbers I just talked about are from a very specific model with a very specific airline that I can't mention the names of, but yes, we get into the weeds with our customers and look at their actual operations, their actual frequencies, and how they actually fly the planes. And look at holistic costs, because it's not just about how many miles or hours you fly, it's about pilot costs, it's about outstation staffing, it's about infrastructure upgrades, and if you're serious about this, you need to look holistically at every, down to what is the interest rate on the loan that you take out in order to, or the financing that you get in order to buy the system in the first place. Like there are, all the holistic view on the economics, and making sure that is, economically positive for our customers is how we get through it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I really want to underline the holistic approach because I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. There's a lot of enthusiasm about quoting direct operating cost reductions with electrification, but if you look at it in the context of regional air mobility, where you're really competing with cars and rail and when you are accepting the fact that electric motors are not in their prime time to address this need today, and you start talking about, okay, well, what really do customers care about other than price? They care about frequency and the reliability of the schedule. And that means that you have to be able to, honor a, a service that will be available in all kinds of weather or most weather. So now you start talking about IFR capability and now you start introducing IFR reserves on top of an already small range budget. And it's only when you look at things holistically like that, do you really get a clear perspective on, okay, how really competitive is electric aviation in this particular use case today or over the next couple of years. And I think that, you know, there needs to be a little bit more realism.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I agree, because I think that realism is going to be what builds credibility. It's what enables adoption, it's what enables all of these other factors, many of which we haven't even touched on, whether it's the insurance companies or the lessors, we have to worry about residual values. the holistic view is the only way you actually get a full ecosystem to buy in. And, I just recently had a deep dive with one of our major customers, on IFR, speed, and Flight into Known Icing conditions, because these are the realities of their operation. And we need to know, hey, if we choose to fly five knots faster or five knots slower, what are the repercussions? If we are, like, flying, like, guaranteeing IFR, or if we are, if, what happens if you're not flight into known icing conditions? You're hardly useful, because it's not just Alaska where you have to deal with icing, right? It's everywhere that you have to be confident in your aircraft's ability to operate. Otherwise these mission critical operations have to ground the plane. And if you ground a plane in one of these operations, it destroys a whole network. It has a residual ripple effect through the operations, until recovered. So, so it's important to have these capabilities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So here's a thought, Kevin. What if after all is said and done, the, 30, 40, 50 percent improvement really becomes something more like 10 percent? I'm talking hypothetically here, right? At what point does it make more sense to incrementally improve the efficiency of a turboprop or a conventional aircraft that is certified, well known, all of those things, and perhaps kickstart the electrification supply chain on the unmanned side of things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It makes a lot of sense to, to find wherever you can build the efficiencies into the operation. from the airframe design, there's some folks out there who, with traditional engines, are looking at cutting 30 to 50 percent of the fuel burn out of your 7 37 class planes by bringing, blended wing body type airplanes to market. So there, there are ways that you can, by creating a new aircraft, even if you're not changing propulsion, you can get some meaningful efficiency gains as well. At the end of the day, when you achieve fewer economic benefits, it reduces the addressable market for the technology. So, or inverting that, for every percent cost that I save, it opens up more and more market opportunities. So, there's a old story in the industry about a major airline that removed a few pages from their in flight brochure to save a few pounds because that mattered, right? And these are fractions of a percent saving. So in your example of saving 10%, still transformative. For many operations. Now, is it going to be as transformative as saving 40? Nowhere close. Will it still be meaningful? Only if it's economically compelling. And so this is where you look at the conversion. You know, so maybe somebody struggles to retrofit their plane, but if you're buying a brand new plane and you get to choose between, CapEx neutral across the two, the combustion or a hybrid, and that hybrid saves 10 percent on your OpEx, you might still go with the hybrid system because economically that still makes sense. So this could be a factor that delays adoption if the economics don't work out. From an unmanned standpoint, we're already seeing from a drones, eVTOL, or like a Department of Defense type applications some fully electric, uh, or places where the economics don't matter as much, where you know, they're willing to pay a premium for the mission capability. Those are certainly additional early adopter areas where I think, the industry is likely to get a boost, regardless of the fuel savings, a boost in market applicability because of the performance characteristics of these new vehicle types.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is the drone propulsion supply chain overlapping into the propulsion supply chain that you deal with?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, a year and a half ago, we acquired a company's assets, called, the company was named Talyn and Talyn was developing a, effectively a cargo lift drone, and various types of payloads that it could carry. Our propulsion systems fit straight into that cargo drone, straight into traditional, conventional takeoff and landing drones, or eVTOL, for a whole variety of applications. Ampaire's focus is, again, the disagreement place number one. Propulsion is where you begin, and I want to put propulsion across everything. And, yeah, so the same engine types, I mean, there are flavors and variations of engines, but, the major families are applicable across. across the industry, whether it's manned or unmanned.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, tell us a little bit about Ampaire. How do you make money today? How do you make money in five years and 10 years? What's your special sweet spot?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Ampaire is focused on the electrification of aviation, focused on propulsion, specifically hybrid electric propulsion, upgrading existing aircraft types as an entry point into market and using that as a gateway to transition the industry toward lower carbon and better economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Give examples of the type of aircraft that you're converting. I saw a Skymaster as\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>so back in 2019, we flew our very first aircraft type, which is a upgraded Cessna Skymaster push pull configuration. We call that an independent parallel hybrid architecture, where you have one combustion engine, one fully electric. We've also flown the Cessna Grand Caravan, which is with an integrated parallel hybrid architecture that uses a, mechanically coupled electric and combustion set of engines to be a hybrid electric aircraft. That same engine that goes into the Caravan is what we just finished our CDR on the King Air for integrating there. We've got the Twin Otter is a 19 passenger plane in the same category. And there are thousands of planes in market that use this category of engine. So this is our half megawatt class system. We also have a quarter megawatt class system, which is used as a, either a genset or propulsion system for general aviation, drones, and eVTOLs. Now, as a company where we're focused is around the certification of that launch product and the Caravan. The market that adopts that is both passenger carrying and cargo carrying for the commercial industry, but then also we've got a number of contracts with the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Energy. So our money today, our revenue, which is really just offsetting NRE costs, or non recurring engineering costs. We've brought in about 25 million of government contracts. For these, through these government customers, for the development of our propulsion system and the application of that system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're making$500 million in 5 years, who are your primary customers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we scale commercial revenue, this comes from the regional aviation market. These are folks who are currently buying turboprop engines and would instead of overhauling their engine or buying a new engine, would be buying one of Ampaire's hybrid electric amp drives. These amp drives are the ones which save 50 percent fuel burn, and we believe will save on maintenance cost as well. So it'll be good economics for people to switch over to our systems rather than run on their traditional combustion system, and this is where we see the earliest adoption for technology. So begins as retrofits of the existing fleet of turboprops, but then quickly moves into partnering with OEMs, the aircraft manufacturers, for when they build a new airplane, giving it a hybrid option. The next phase is, of course, working on clean sheet design planes with OEMs who are optimizing planes, new designs, around the novel propulsion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Tell us a little bit about your, you have a great history of being an innovator and entrepreneur. Give us some lessons learned to our innovators who are listening today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, it's been eight and a half years at Ampaire. The number one and biggest recommendation I can give is choose something that you deeply love and that you think you can actually achieve. The days get challenging over the course of years as an entrepreneur. It is not easy. It is oftentimes not even fun. But when you know that you're doing the right thing, when you're tackling the most meaningful, challenging, visible problems that you possibly can, it gives the motivation, not just for you as an individual innovator, but truly, these are things done by teams. And when you have meaningful work, and you're thoughtful about it, it enables you to pull together teams of really great people to go do these audacious things. I think the importance of setting tangible and tractable goals that you can actually achieve in the near term is very important. It's not just about moonshots, it's about the steps on how to get there. And, and ultimately, it's about building long standing relationships and not looking for what do I get now or, being short sighted in them, because truly the world is built by people and, and supported by relationships that are built over years or decades. And so, being a good actor in the industry is so important.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, you've acquired companies, you were almost acquired yourself. What advice would you have for people who might be going through a similar process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so always be open to opportunity and thoughtfully assess it. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the opportunity to go public via SPAC was pretty exciting, and there was a whole lot of money on the table, both from company valuations and from operating budgets. But you also have to be willing to change course when it's clear that the course you're on is not the right one, which we did in early 2022. Ampaire pulled out of a deal to go public because we realized that it was, the higher risk path and it was not worth, continuing down that path of going public and getting acquired. These are hard decisions that you need clarity, you need good advisors and mentors to support you on, and ultimately you need to set the ego aside a lot of times and go on good first principles when making your decisions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, thanks a lot.

The viability of it has been proven very clearly. That this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think there has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space podcast and our conversation with Bobby Healy, CEO and Founder of Manna Drone Delivery. Bobby was a standout guest when we had him on the podcast back in March of 22, and we're delighted he could join us for a return visit today. Returning guests, give us such a cool perspective. They provide an update on the original assumptions and actual outcomes of the last two years. And with Bobby drone delivery overall, and more specifically Manna Drone Delivery, he reminds us of the original assumptions, what has actually occurred and what's been pleasant and disappointing surprises and how he sees the future and perhaps differently than his original assumptions. For those of who know Bobby and listen to his original conversation, you know he's a compelling, articulate industry veteran and accomplished aviation business professional. He's both a person who understands the technology and its application, and combines this with decades of aviation knowledge. And highly successful aviation technology implementation. This isn't always the case with some of the innovators and leaders in advanced air mobility. And it's perhaps one of the reasons more our app to bet on Bobby's projects and his vision for the future. And as we do with all guests, we listened to their important messages and we politely challenge their core underlying assumptions. And we've done the same with Bobby. Listen to what Bobby says is the killer app for drone delivery. Do you agree? He provides details with market size and price, which is refreshing. He talks about the value of B2C versus B2B in drone delivery. This in itself would make for a good podcast discussion as a lot of companies are focusing on B2B delivery. One of Bobby's essential messages is that the economics have now been proven for this space. Listen to his discussion of business and operational profitability. As we all know, getting to profitability is a challenge for any business. And it has been particularly challenging for some in advanced air mobility. Listen to how we discusses how Manna wants to power big and small brands directly. As an example, he has a deal with Coca Cola, where he flies their products. He discusses how he simply wants to replace the road and that consumers will and should never go back to road based delivery. If you listen carefully, you'll hear why Bobby has been more successful than others. I was a bit surprised by technology is actually deploying in house versus what others would hope he would purchase from outside technology providers. And finally listen to where Bobby believes advanced air mobility investments should be made beyond drone delivery. His answers may or may not surprise you. So many, thanks to Bobby for rejoining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our talk with Bobby Healy as you innovate and generate profits in The Vertical Space. Bobby kicked off his career building video games for Nintendo. He then founded Eland technologies an airline technology company, which he sold 12 years later to SITA. He then built Car Trawler the world's largest mobility marketplace for airlines over 15 years and led two successful LBOs for the business. For the last four years he's been building Manna a\"Drone Delivery as a Service\" business, whose mission is to improve the world by making lightning fast, suburban deliveries, affordable green and safe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, welcome back to The Vertical Space. We first spoke in March of 2022 and so we thought it would be great to bring you back and talk about the drone delivery industry and what has changed there, as well as what has changed with Manna. A lot of things have changed. So time to debunk some myths.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And it's great to be here again, guys. I'm really looking forward to it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Perfect. As you know, we typically ask if there's something that few in the industry agree with you on, would you amend your original answer or something else that's on your mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">If you look at my LinkedIn, you'll see that argument or the main arguments play out. Most people assume, not people in our industry, but generally people think that the use case is critical products, medical, defibrillators, urgent, societally beneficial products, and they are great use cases for sure. But the economic reality is that coffee and takeaway food is the killer app for what we do. That's one thing that most people, they don't disagree, they're just uninformed. They haven't done the work or the research that we've done on where the market opportunity is. And then the second one kind of hand in hand with that is a lot of people believe again, incorrectly that the unit economics or the capital economics don't work right now that they will at some point in the future when some magical technology comes along to make them work. But that's where I find, I enjoy myself the most on LinkedIn answering some of the people that have, raised those questions because I mean, I have the data, we have the flights, we're operating with profitable economics now. And I do enjoy engaging with people on the many misconceptions that are in our industry. And thankfully, we've already debunked them, not in theory or research. We're actually flying the debunk, even today as we speak we're flying aircraft in Dublin that are running profitable unit economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I would add that even when we talk to industry insiders, there is a tendency to think that B2B delivery use cases will be the ones that scale first, or at least if you asked them a couple years ago. There was a general tendency to believe that urgent cargo, high value not necessarily high volume movement will be the one that gains traction initially, especially because of the, arguably easier safety case to build with predetermined points in the network, as opposed to ad hoc, don't really know where the next order will come up, low value, you know, how in the world can you make money, delivering coffee and meals, et cetera, et cetera. Yet, as we often discuss on the podcast, those use cases didn't really scale past POCs and pilots, globally, whereas the, B2C delivery, the kind that Manna is doing is really starting to show some interesting inflection.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I agree. In the end we're running an infrastructure and that infrastructure is an airline. It's a cargo airline. And just like any other airline, utilization is a key factor in the profitability of that airline. And every airline in the world talks about load factor or utilization in our world. And you don't get that with high priority, critical goods, the volume just isn't there. So there's no world where you can make, those critical medical type deliveries a very interesting business from a commercial standpoint. And the other thing is you don't learn anything by doing that. Other than building an aircraft, you don't really learn anything. The real learning in serving the space we serve is in being in the trenches doing five, six hundred, a thousand deliveries a day out of a small car park and getting a 30 second turnaround time and embedding that learning into the software, into the hardware and iterating through that. So unfortunately, and there's a number of great players in our space that are doing and have done a really good job, pioneering job, I would say in medical delivery, but it doesn't translate in any way whatsoever to suburban, backyard, high throughput delivery. it's just two totally different paradigms and two different things to optimize.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Some of the guests we've had on have sometimes mentioned coffee delivery in a trivial way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Disparaging way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. And so, so when, as you're saying, listen, it's a, is it a good start for you? Is it a good proving ground for you? But can you scale and meet your financial projections that you want to hit in the next three years, delivering coffee?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already, every single coffee delivery we do is profitable. So 100 percent of them now, like we used to be at the weekends because we'd have higher utilization and then, weekdays were less so, but now our volume has diluted the fixed cost per location so they are profitable. And the thing about coffee is there isn't a product as popular on the planet for adults on a daily basis that has the adoption rate and the frequency and the gross margin that works so well that where the benefits of flying in a straight line as we do underwrite the new mode of delivering these products. So in a world where there's no such thing really as coffee delivery and people are now, I mean, you know, Starbucks or Starbucks drive thru is an example of Starbucks mobile app, people are absolutely addicted to, I would say, high consumption patterns, high frequency purchasing coffee. So of course it's going to be the best product. But now you say, people do trivialize it. Yes, only because I think not from a business sense, they're not saying coffee isn't a great product, but they're really saying, I think, is using the airspace to deliver a coffee seems like a bad idea to me. That's really what they're saying without saying it. And that's the purpose of I think regulation and the standards like Part 108 or in our case, U-Space in Europe, standards that are scalable that do allow high throughput in that airspace below 500 feet. And when we look at the market size we estimate that today there's 5. 2 billion food deliveries a year from the top four aggregators annually growing at 15%. So think DoorDash Uber eats all the way down and that's with a constrained market where there's a labor shortage, there's labor costs, economics problems, and there's a quality issue. So, so therefore those 5. 2 billion orders, road based orders are coming from customers that want it come hell or high water. Even if it's a bad customer experience and it's expensive. And the U S customer is paying nearly a 60 percent premium on basket value to get that pizza delivered. And they're never happy with it, but look, 5. 2 billion orders. So that's the current market. Our estimate puts it at a 16 billion order market without even trying, if we can remove the road from the equation and use aircraft. So you tell me one industry where you have probably a hundred billion dollar market staring at you in the face that's untapped, where the technology has proven we've already got positive uni economics. And the only thing between us and that giant market, I guess there's a social acceptance thing. You can't go too fast, too quickly. There's some regulatory, things still to unlock. But if you side that up beside blood delivery or vaccine delivery or whatever, it just dwarfs that space. And we didn't want to take on something easy. We wanted to take on the most impactful, space and that is everyday goods to everyday people in every suburban house on the planet profitably. And we're at the start of that now.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The other thing that strikes me about the coffee and the last mile consumer delivery is that you have the opportunity for a very consistent operation in order to make deliveries into all those customers in the market. By and large, they're already accustomed to ordering things from their phone from the ground based delivery aggregators. And in contrast, when we went and looked into the B2B medical delivery space, at least in the developed world, the companies face a pretty involved enterprise integration and organizational integration for each customer or each segment of customers. How is that flight operation going to work? Who is going to have the authority to initiate a flight? All of it ends up being a pretty heavy front load, cost and integration and it's heterogeneous operations as the business grows. Whereas in this it seems you already have a foundation of educated consumers accustomed to receiving deliveries via phone operations and it lays the groundwork for a reasonable path to go and scale a company to go and address that market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and there's no, enterprise sales process or there's no finding a budget somewhere in some hospital or some company's budget to try and do this innovative new mode. Our customers are the ones that are drinking the coffee. And they're abundant and they're aware of us and it's viral and all of these tailwinds to what we're doing that don't exist in the enterprise market. And then the other thing is we, again, we look at different densities. So European population density is much higher than US population density in suburbs. So for example, in Europe, we use a lot of motorbikes to move blood around between hospital critical to beat the traffic and it's very hard to justify, you know, why would you spend a large infrastructure budget and drones when the motorbike network's already there, largely run by volunteers. it's just sometimes forcing technology into a place where technology doesn't belong. Now different in Africa or, you know, countries that don't have transport infrastructure anyway. And of course there, you're not providing drone delivery. You're providing transport infrastructure. But there's already solid transport modes in most modern economies that are not as good as drone delivery, but they're not far off. So your benefits are marginal. And then you're incurring, as you said rightly, all this overhead of cold chain of all the trail of every part of the process for that sample or whatever it is. And then of course, toxic substances. a lot of the products you might want to fly in medical areas are considered hazardous substances, so, chemotherapy drugs is a great use case, but you're into a whole other area of risk there. And we just said, look, there's parts of that prize that we're interested in and we also liked the fact that it's a critical need to deliver those products, but at the same time, it comes with just such difficult challenges on the economic side of things that from my view, it's always going to be a business that's subsidized by something. And that's, I think, why it succeeded so well in Africa to date. And I think honestly, it's going to be challenged in other markets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I may say something really quickly, we can move on from this. As it relates to medical delivery, and in clinical pathology versus anatomic pathology, so blood versus tissue, I think an argument could be made that there's high volume of both, and tissue pathology will have a much higher critical factor, and there'll be a lot of price behind that, because there's a sensitivity to it where that may be a good market. I think they're both relatively high volume, but one difference between a cup of coffee is that the economics may not play out unless there's a lot of volume in the delivery. They're not going to pay a lot for one piece of blood, and I think one thing we discovered, Luka and Peter, on one of our podcasts was what's the real value of getting it there a little bit faster when it's a 24 hour turn on the testing anyway? But my sense is that the, and Bobby, in hospitals, labs, there's a very large cost item set aside for courier.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's a big element for labs. So maybe that's a next stage for you if the economics play out, but that meets a lot of your criteria, conceivably clinical and anatomic pathology, maybe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. I mean, I'd love to be, I'm not sure I'll be proven wrong here. What I'm, I guess in the end, what I'm saying is if you're going to build an infrastructure then you underwrite the cost of an infrastructure with a viable business case, and then all the other applications can work on top of that. So if you're already in a city or a suburb or whatever it is, and you're flying trivial products, albeit you're making money doing it, why wouldn't you then deploy that for other use cases? It could be beer. It could be medicine, like you say, samples, all of these things. And we can pick products up as well as drop them off. And why wouldn't you deploy? Of course you would. But you don't start with that because you're always going to be building a business that needs to be subsidized by something. And again, it comes back to ambition and scale. And for us, the ambition is unlimited. And we say, what is the biggest use case that we can solve? And it is, no matter what you say. It's always going to be the suburban household and their needs. And that's going to be what will underwrite the infrastructure for any successful player in this space. It ain't going to be medical.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>19:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, you talk about the potential to expand the market from what 5. 2 billion deliveries per year today with the ground based aggregators to something much larger. When you look at the differences that drone delivery brings into the equation, whether it's speed or environmental advantages or a safety case or cost, what do you see as being the key drivers that are creating the behavior change that leads you to think that there's a 16 billion a year, delivery opportunity?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">There's existing numbers that show adoption rates of road based delivery between 4 and 5% around the world and they kind of point to a low take up rate and there's our own data as well. and there's different states. I think that the restaurants are a small business. Think the consumer at the end of it all. And you look at the different things that they think are important. And in the case of the restaurant, restaurants frequently, they just can't, they can't get delivery, right? It's just too expensive. They can't do it themselves. The aggregators that power them, the, DoorDashes and Ubers and so on, that power them and themselves are constrained with output as well, if it rains, if the weather's bad in any way, or if it's peak time, you just can't meet the demand peaks, with people, it just doesn't work. So the result is batching, where multiple orders are put in with one driver and therefore cold food or terrible quality food and unpredictable times. And that's reflected in the NPS or the ratings of all of the aggregators, which are on the floor, not because they're not great businesses. They are, but they're constrained by just a limited output that they have. So why are we different? Because we're point to point. our average flight time is just less than three minutes. Physics is on our side. And when you have that advantage, the outcome is look, it's literally as simple as the outcome is hot food or hot coffee or, and in good condition. And that is remarkably the most important thing. It isn't speed. It will speed kind of translates into quality, but also reliability and predictability, which is as important as quality. People are willing to wait 15 minutes or 20 minutes. They are willing so long as that's what it is. But with batching and traveling, the traveling salesman algorithm, there's no way to be sure about that. So, so the variability is very poor. And so the consumer is going to modify their behavior because of drone delivery and the advantages it has. And we already see that in something as simple as coffee delivery. And before we existed, there was no such thing as coffee delivery in suburbs. That nobody would be crazy enough to do that because you won't make any money but yet our basket value in our coffee shop is more than twice the the basket value of the average order in the coffee shop itself, because behavior, right? It's a household order. So it's 2. 3 beverages per basket. There's a bunch of pastries and so on and then the other stakeholder for us, as I said, the vendor, the small business, they're looking at this saying they're now able to reach a couple of hundred thousand up to half a million customers in their catchment area of less than a five minute flight. And they're saying this is massive for their business. So. That's another stakeholder. And then the final stakeholder for us is the aggregator itself. And we'd expect our business is going to be, we call it B2B. And what we mean by B2B is we just want to be a delivery company. So we want to power the aggregators. We want to power the big brands. We have a deal with Coca Cola where we fly their products, but we want to power all of the big and the small brands directly, simply replacing the road. And so you think about the aggregators and their numbers are public. The aggregators lose money on most of their orders in suburbs because of the time it takes to deliver them and the labor costs and the labor laws. So we know the benefits to them are actually simply unit economics. we can do a delivery for them cheaper than they can do it themselves quite simply, and still make a strong margin ourselves because of our operating economics. So there's different stakeholders, but it, and some of them, it's about economics and some of them it's about experience and quality, and some of it, it's about growing the market. And by the way, the five to 16 primarily comes from number one is actually just widening the addressable market. So you're going from where the aggregators really only want to do very dense areas and quite short trips to obviously optimize their costs. We can now do much longer trips and support much less population dense areas. So you're actually widening the market to those like 92 million detached single family homes in the USA. And similarly in Europe, there's these really fragmented towns, suburb cities that aren't that easy to address for the traditional mode. So it's a combination of just customer behavior, I think, and market addressability.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, you answered the question, but I was going to ask if there are categories of products that people just wouldn't consider ordering via ground based delivery because they just know it's going to take too long, like a latte or something. And are you seeing that people will order those products given their expectation that it will arrive faster via a drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, we survey them as well. And quite interesting. If you look at lots of publicly available data, the key categories for road based delivery are, in order, if I just pick one market, the UK, where there's great data. And it's quite similar in the USA as well, but there's the top one is pizza. And then it's, other products like Indian or Chinese and burgers and fries is like fourth or fifth in the list of, perishable prepared meals. But actually if you ask people what they want to eat, burgers and fries is the number one thing. So what's going on there is people already know that certain products just don't deliver well, they don't travel well, and anyone that's got a road based delivery of burgers and fries knows that after 20 minutes, it's just toxic. So, so therefore you can't reheat it either. So, so consumers know not to order these things. So in the existing road based data, there's a hidden demand that's there that's not satisfied. We know that already from ours. And our number one, outside of coffee, our second one is probably tied between burgers and fries and ice cream. And an ice cream is an interesting one because you don't need a lot of choice in ice cream, right? You just need a quality, well known brand or two for the customer. But ice cream is interesting because it's 168 hours of the week almost, it's almost flat by hour of day of week. And it's driven by family orders, right? These are orders that have an experience associated with them, like a party or watching a movie or things like that. And the alternative is getting your car for 35 or 40 minutes to get the ice cream if you don't happen to have it. So we do see people now starting to rely on us for certain categories like coffee and ice cream that they might've pre purchased a week at a time and stored it in their fridge before, and now they just don't care cause they can get it from us and then the really the alarm bells, I think in a good way that ring for us is that burgers and fries in terms of meals are number one category. And finally, I would say people are saying, finally, I can get French fries. It actually tastes like French fries and they arrive. And I know that sounds trivial, but it isn't. It's the flagship product of McDonald's, right? I mean, French fries. I started this business because I wanted a bag of French fries and we call them chips in Ireland. I joke about it, but I did. And it's one of those, highly sought after products that delivery just fails.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>27:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I mean, Uber is a great case study in how an addressable market can expand when you introduce a new capability or a new user experience. I don't have the data to back this up, but I'm just basing this on my own consumption patterns and those close to me, but I'd be comfortable saying that a lot of Uber users their budgets for taxi and black cars prior to Uber were not the same as their Uber budgets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And the amount of music people consume now, it's Spotify. there's things that consumers never would have told you they wanted until you gave it to them and then they're absolutely reliant on it. It's like air and we'll be the same. We already are in the towns we operate in. It's just, people are blown away by the fact that they can get our service but at the same time, they straight away adjust to it and they start to get angry with us if we're 60 seconds late it almost feels like for some of them. So, so, and that's a good thing. it really is the end of road based delivery. When you offer this service, consumers never going back to road based delivery. And I think that's not unexpected. Our job has been at the engineering level to make sure that no matter what the weather is, they wouldn't need to go back. So that means flying in minus 20 C plus 42 C, very strong winds, I think 35 mile an hour winds, things like that, rain, obviously snow. And if you don't do all of those things and really from an engineering point of view, harden the product, you don't have a business. There's no point being a drone delivery business for fair weather because the restaurants and the customers that you're powering, they'll just, they just, if you, if they can't trust that you're going to always be there, you're a novelty, you're the circus. And that's not who we want to be. So you have to start with the very hardest of solutions and an engineer for that. And when I think about what advice I would give people, you can't start in this business with a halfway house. You have to have the final, picture solved. That's a mistake we nearly made at the start. And just by sheer luck, we happen to be in Ireland, which is the worst country in the world to do a drone delivery business, permanently raining, permanently windy. So therefore we can fly in any weather, but it comes back to, and it's very important. I know it sounds like engineering, but I'm trying not to be too engineering about this. But if you want to be real in drone delivery you have to replace the car fully. You can't be partial replacement. And that makes it much more difficult. The engineering equation is just much harder and the testing equation is much harder. Even the delivery mode, the way we deliver the software we've written for that arrival at the house and delivering, it looks simple. but it's not, it's quite the opposite. And then testing that out in the wild and, is one thing in a big field in the middle of nowhere, but testing it where there's customers underneath you, is a whole other thing. And that takes so much time. Sorry, I'm wondering, but it goes to what do you need to solve for, right? You need to solve for predictability, availability, speed equals quality, cost, unit cost, and yeah. So safety, I don't even talk about safety because you don't have a right to exist, if you're not safe and that comes down to, yes, we have governance because we're regulated by aviation regulators and a lot of oversight comes from that. But. It doesn't make you safe. There's a million ways to still not be safe, even if you're regulated. I think that comes from, there's a, there's an existential threat hanging over the industry if it's irresponsible when it starts to scale. And what that translates to, It took us five years and I don't think you're going to do much quicker than that. And when you start developing a backyard delivery product to, to really scaling it, which is where we are now, it's somewhere between three to five years timeline. And no amount of fantastic engineering, or engineers speed that up. It's a process of gradually evolving, crawl, walk, run more and more volume. You can't please the investors with this one. You have to manage them and let them know that it's a long, arduous process to make sure that you're safe. And I certainly see that in the industry, we've done a great job at that. I don't see anyone pretending that it can go, at blitz scaling pace, but it will, and I think there's a number of, operators like ourselves, like Wing, for example, Google's program that are now ready to start some really, serious growth in a safe way. So, but it is not your typical industry where a five year path normally to a startup, building a viable product with viable economics and the start of a revenue journey. That's very difficult, space by any measure. And so it'll come to what's the market look like in, in a decade, who'll be there, how many will be there, that kind of thing. Just because you mentioned the word safety, what it translates to is a market that's going to be a very few number of players with sufficient deep pockets and patience to get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, Bobby, delving into the customer experience a little bit more. Are you, guiding customers towards expectations for how long it will take for different categories of products to arrive from the time that they push order on their phone? What is a reasonable expectation for a latte versus a hamburger and fries versus other takeout food. Obviously the drone delivery operation itself is a consistent time period, but the preparation time and the other\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">what should customers be expecting?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. There's a very difficult problem to solve actually and the big aggregators have, have done the best job at this simply because of time and the data that they have. Truth is a restaurant that's preparing meals is a very unpredictable output line, particularly smaller ones. And from a day to day or hour to hour basis, quite difficult to predict. Now there's some very large brand players. I don't need to name names, you know, they are, but they can produce a meal every 20 seconds and they can get one through their drive through every 35 seconds. And so for those types of brands, we can tell the customer down to the minute when they can expect to see their nuggets or their fries or whatever it is land in their back garden, essentially for the others, and we have a number of vendors that are, they're a super product, but they're erratic to say the least. So we tell the customer it's a three minute flight or a two minute flight or whatever it is based on the range and the wind. And then we say, and the prep time for this restaurant is between five minutes and you know, with Google flights, you get this kind of bar chart of likely we give them a bar chart of likely arrival times based on the vendor's prep time. And we tell them what's happening as well. So they know in our app or through our API with our B2B partners, they know when the vendor started to prepare, they know when the vendors finished preparing, they know when we've received the goods from the vendor. They know when it's been loaded onto the aircraft. They know when the aircraft's taken off and then they can track it in real time. So the reason we do all of those things is the customer can always see progression and that's important. So the customer does not mind waiting 15 minutes 20 minutes for their burgers and fries, so long as you keep them updated on that progress. And so we measure time by stages, but if I look at my order to arrival time. So it's a time the customer pressed the purchase button to the arrival time. We see a range for products like our Coca Cola delivery, the median time for the aircraft to take off after the order is two minutes. Flight time is three minutes. So, so median time about five minutes all the way up to the premium, we've got this French guy that makes these, delicious sandwiches, but he takes 20 minutes to make the sandwich, but again, it isn't about the actual time. It's about the confidence in that time. And look, our NPS, our net promoter score is 86 year to date. And that's because we have this obvious advantage that we fly, but also we manage, as you say, the customer expectations very clearly. through constant messaging of progression of their\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay. So as you scale and demand increases, how do you keep customer expectations realistic? If it's coming up on lunchtime and you get a bunch of, order interest coming in and you have only so much, delivery capacity during that hour and that, beyond a certain amount, deliveries are going to be delayed simply because you're waiting for a free drone to go and make that flight. How do you prevent customer disappointment with the experience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And we have an advantage there over road as well, because we know if we look forward at the next 60 minutes and we calculate capacity in the next 60 minutes for any given GPS points, we know pretty accurately how many orders we can handle for the next 60 minutes. And that's the window where, it's actually between 30 and 60 minutes where a customer will say, I'm not willing to wait that long. I'll drive myself or I'll do without. So the first and foremost, there's no point adding capacity blindly if you don't know how to assess it in real time. So the way we look at it is we continually add capacity in units, as our repeat cohort of customers grows, so too does our volume, orders per hour, per day of week, and that's pretty easy to anticipate, and we just allocate extra capacity ahead of time. Overcapacity for us isn't such an issue when you look at the aircraft utilization, because we don't care so much about an aircraft sitting on the tarmac. We care about the people's cost, the people cost that would load that aircraft cargo, they're there anyway. So when we flex up and down capacity, it's more about flexing up and down the people that manage or load cargo or monitor those aircraft than the actual aircraft themselves.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the most utilization sensitive component of your operation is utilization of your human labor, not utilization of your airframes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Correct. Yeah, we don't really care about utilization of the airframes. I mean, we do, but in the end, don't forget we have mobile aircrafts. Our aircraft can load balance from one cell to the other. In other words, the aircraft can autonomously go from one location to another to serve demand in different locations. So we can dynamically allocate the fleet to. And there's other great use cases like parcel delivery, postal delivery, for example, and pharmacy delivery, even that you can take orders with a four hour window on them and just send them in underutilized slots. So we can balance our utilization through the day, particularly daytime hours. So I think as we grow, there'll be more of those what we call latent orders that have a window of delivery time that don't need instant delivery that we will use our fleets to fly. So I'm not too concerned about the aircraft itself. It's the people and we have two modes of operation. We have one where we're highly centralized, all the aircraft and a handful of people. And also, for example, one of our people can load between 20 and 30 flights per hour. So that's our number, right? and 20 or 30 flights per hour is the best you're going to do because our turnaround time is between 30 and 60 seconds, right? Aircraft landing, aircraft taking off and that you can't beat that. No, there's no way to beat that number. But that's the cost, right? That's that person's cost for those 20 or 30 deliveries. And you want them fully utilized. So if you're over budgeted on those people, then you're going to increase your cost per delivery. So that's the way to think about it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, what's been the biggest change in the drone delivery market in the last two years since we talked?

And like I said, I always, I'm not a great mathematician, but if you scale a negative number, you get a larger negative number, no matter how hard you try. no, look, we already have$4 in and around sometimes less, sometimes more dependent time of the week and the cargo cost per delivery fully loaded. Right. That's, and we're going to, by the way, publish this data, both on LinkedIn and through our friends at McKinsey. And so you'll see it and, but you can also see a very clear path to$2 cost for delivery, like literally with our eyes closed, we won't get there at the end of this year. We won't be far off it, but even limited scaling will bring us to a$2 cost per delivery. And what we want to win at is that, going back to the Warren Buffett, right, in a commodity world and drone delivery, ultimately, at scale and over 20 years commodity, right, it's A to B safely and quickly. The winner will be the ones that have the best cost of operation. This is why Ryanair succeeded, is why Southwest did so well in the earlier days. And we learned from history of running businesses that it's not the coolest product that's going to win in this space. Nobody cares. it's about the cost. So, so what's changed, I think we've demonstrated in superb fashion that the industry is viable, economically viable, and I think that's important. And then I think regulatory wise, again, we now fly BVLOS all over Europe. We have license all over Europe. Europe has really strong, difficult, but really clear regulations. USA has moved forward at pace as well. We see pretty much everyone operating with 135s, we see Google really starting to expand their operations, we see major brands like Walmart really leaning into it, so I would say ahead of expectations in Europe, for sure, and what we would have predicted in the USA as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What about a disappointment, Bobby?

I would love to see, and we would love to be flying under 108, very soon, but, still uncertain and uncertainty kills an industry like ours, well, it doesn't kill it, but it just makes it very difficult for companies like us to continue to grow and raise money to grow when there's uncertainty around the regulatory environment. And so 108's a discipline. Well, it's not a disappointment. It's great. We love it. It's the right shape. It feels exactly what the industry needs to scale. It's just hard to say when those, rules will be written and we'll go through the process and become, routine. So is it a disappointment? No, like I'm pretty happy that we have BVLOS in Europe. There's, 500 million people here, 300 million of which we can reach. so there's plenty of business. And I would say to any drone delivery company. get over here and start flying. Like Google are flying a mile away from my house here, where I'm recording this from, Europe is a fantastic place to build some scale. It's not as great a market the USA, it's a market where you can really get flying anyway. So, so disappointments, they're not really disappointments. They're just, it's the, I just wish it could all move a little bit more quickly in the USA. and other than that, I think we're in really strong shape.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How should we make sense of the different operating cost numbers that we see in the industry media or being talked about across the different companies that are doing this? From your vantage point, do you know if they're all being formulated the same way? Are we talking about apples to apples or apples to oranges with these numbers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think, there's some wishful thinking in some of the things that I've, seen. I would say, remembering WeWork and community adjusted EBITDA is the phrase I would think of here. You have to include packaging cost, battery motor depreciation, prop depreciation, maintenance, aircraft depreciation, personnel, all of the other costs, but those are the main ones that I listed there. If all of those aren't in your unit economics there's already a problem and particularly aircraft depreciation. So again, that goes to our aircraft has a useful life of 75, 000 deliveries. And that means that our depreciation factor is relatively low. And that's an intentional part of our product design, even battery management, battery maintenance, those ones should be equal for everybody, right, because we're all using lithium ion in some way. And we're charging them at different speeds, discharging them at different speeds, but largely speaking, while we think we're better than most on battery, I think you could pretty much assume that everyone's the same in that regard. I think where all of the players differ greatly is in longevity of the aircraft, how many cycles you're going to get from the aircraft. It's throughput per hour. And that comes to hot swap architecture or not hot swap and then charging in situ kind of the opposite of hot swap. Charging in situ means that your battery won't last as long. And after the person loading the cargo, battery is your biggest unit cost. And what I mean by that is if you're charging a battery in sub zero temperatures, or if you're charging a battery in very high temperatures, it's not going to live as long as a battery that's charged at a consistent temperature indoors. And that comes down to aircraft architecture and operational architecture. In other words, hot swap battery, the battery's only outdoors for 60 seconds before it flies. We've thought about all of that and we've thought about it because of our focus on unit costs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so you're treating batteries and motors as consumables. Those are not going 75, 000 flights. Those are being replaced periodically, but it's the remainder of the aircraft that you assert has a 75, 000 flight life. Okay, so how many flight hours, just from an aviation standpoint, comparing the expected life of this aircraft in terms of flight hours? How many is that? Roughly 15, 000 flight hours?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's a divide by eight, divide by eight. We do eight flights an\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">hour So what is the remainder of that airframe? What data do you have that, gives you confidence that this is a 75, 000 flight item? And what's your approach to continued airworthiness and maintenance of that object over that time?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Data. So our old aircraft, we call it the 3.8, was a 20, 000 flights aircraft. And we've never written one off before that, but we have many of them that have done more than that. We've a couple of aircraft over 20, 000, 25, 000 flights each. So we have formed there. We know what are the things to engineer for. When you talk about our newer aircraft, which we call 3.8.4 really it's functionally no different than our old aircraft, except for the propulsion system, which is a, it's a much easier maintenance system because most of the failures in our previous aircraft came down to wear and tear during maintenance, during routine changes of parts of the subsystem, props or, motors. So our new aircraft airframe, a single piece of carbon fiber, no moving parts. And that is easy to cycle, right? It's very easy to cycle that airframe through actually half a million flight cycles, on simulator on test benches, should I say, and get the data. And that's the process for evaluating what the lifetime of each component is. You're right, our motors and our batteries and props actually, for that matter, are in our unit cost. So we write off motors after 2000 hours. We write off batteries, in a number of flights, a number of cycles. So it's very predictable. And props less predictable although there's expected lifetime for props, it's mostly, preemptive, I would say monitoring for imperfections or damage to props and changing, but it's stack ranked it's battery, motor, props. And then we apply just a consistent percentage overhead to the entire bill of materials on the aircraft outside of that annual cost, which is quite conservative to get the look, this cable failed or that, that LIDAR unit failed or whatever, because components fail individually and in very unpredictable ways. And so I think the right approach there is just apply a consistent proportion of the overall bill of materials in an annual tax almost in form of maintenance and component switching. And we're, we've been in this five years, we think we have very good data on that. So we're, and as I said, we're quite conservative on it, but it's still overall the depreciation of the entire system for per flight is quite low. It's certainly lower than the person loading the cargo. And then continued airworthiness or maintenance and, the traditional aviation part of things, I would say our old aircraft or existing aircraft depending on what you're day you're operating on, is an aircraft that required a lot of overhead, a lot of maintenance inspections, frequent inspections, frequent overhauls. And we moved now to our new aircraft that just self diagnoses everything, designed for high throughput, long time without even an inspection. But it still backs down to very traditional aviation practices for keeping aircraft in the air and ensuring that they're safe. We, I don't think we're any different there than company that flies small planes or helicopters in the processes, the training, all that stuff that happens.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Given that you'll be publishing some numbers soon, are you comfortable sharing with our audience some high level,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Of course I\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">major cost drivers and the specific\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I actually, I predicted you would ask me, so I actually got a breakdown. Yeah. Yeah. Are you ready? Well, why wouldn't I talk about this? Because we, we do the best, right? So, so today,$4.27 cost per delivery of which fixed overhead, 71 cents, labor$1.93 consumables and depreciation,$1.63. That's where we are today. And then by the end of this year, well, look, I don't want to promise too much, but that'll probably be closer to$3 than even$3.50. Yeah. And then if I look at the human costs, so, and this comes to our operation, which again will evolve. We have different roles. So we have what we call a dispatcher, which is what others would call a pilot, that's a person that for us can monitor up to 20 aircraft simultaneously. What role they have? I don't know, because there's no sticks. There's no control of our aircraft, but they're there anyway, monitoring, but our loaders is our biggest cost. So, so that those are people that just take cargo from a vendor, load on the aircraft, just over a dollar per delivery. That's interesting because Ireland, in fact, Europe is a high wage environment, and so our hourly cost for labor is about$18. so if you look at that and then you look at our future system, which does not need those loaders, so when I talk about going from$3 to$2, that loader for us goes away and the vendor loads the cargo. So we're not in a rush to do that. We have the system built, we're happy. But for now we want to operate just highly centralized, very well managed, location. So we have that loader cost. And the number of the$1.63 that I mentioned earlier on in consumables, I can tell you stack ranked in there it's battery is roughly 50 percent of that currently that'll come down a bit with new battery chemistry we have, and then motors is second at about 25% and then maintenance, just a fixed cost of maintenance per flight that we apply and props and replacement components is the remainder of it. And there are some benefits to scale purchasing of these were obviously tiny now in terms of scale of purchasing. So that$1.63 we predict at scale will come down to about 45 cents. And so when we get from$4.27, where we are now, down to$3 or say$2 and 2 cents is the number I'm looking at, the bulk of that comes from reducing our consumables cost by just scale and better purchasing power. And then there's a pretty significant, unlock for us in change of battery chemistry, so going to a more conservative battery chemistry, but one that has a higher number of cycles and that comes from, again, this, we see this as a major advantage that our system has is that we don't need to charge our batteries and anything over 1C. So we can charge them slowly because the aircraft isn't waiting for a charge with us, so we might have seven, eight, nine battery systems, cargo systems per aircraft, and one of them is flying while eight of them are charging, so we can charge them very slowly and therefore get many more cycles out of the battery. And that, that counts in this space. It really does count. The top level architecture we have, we think it is designed for throughput, of course, productivity of real estate space, but also it flows through that because we have this hotswap battery, our costs per delivery are quite a bit lower than I think for people that are charging in situ, but look, those are the numbers. And we're actually going to publish the whole thing in detail for everyone to look at, but there should be no surprises in there. And I think largely our lower cost is driven by our higher throughput per hour.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Are these contribution costs, Bobby, or what costs are not included?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So those are pretty much everything.

So don't forget our cost gets diluted by the number of drones, right? And then that's proportional to the utilization of that same number of drones. So if we've resourced it correctly, in terms of the human loaders, then you need a 55 percent utilization of that capacity to reach those numbers. Those are numbers that we deliver today based on our existing volume.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What does that translate in terms of, daily deliveries per aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we do all of that with less than 300 deliveries a day for our four aircraft.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But there are delivery surges, in the morning, at lunchtime, different parts of the day, and then there are low periods. Is that right?

So volume is what takes care of that, Peter. So you, you reduce. Or should I say you increase the granularity of utilization as volume grows, right? So we already see weekends, for example, we operate 12 hours a day. Weekends are, I wouldn't say I haven't looked last week, but they're north of 90 percent utilization now on weekends. And what we probably should do is add more aircraft and drive more demand, but we are not motivated by volume. We've never been motivated by volume for this stage of the business. We've been always motivated by those KPIs around cost per delivery and optimizing for that. So we're about to open two other bases in the same suburb. So we'll be bringing it up to the gigantic number of 12 aircraft, which doesn't sound like a lot to most folks, but that's a thousand deliveries a day for us, more than a thousand deliveries a day cause they're very productive aircraft. And if we're successful at getting that over time, if we fill that capacity, which we will, once we switch on certain new channels, but think probably across the week, it'll be anywhere from 400 to a thousand real deliveries a day in the suburb. you'll have always have that right, but we'll flex up and down the human resourcing part of that across those, days of the week and hours of the day. And we, we think a natural place to be is about 70 percent utilization and at 70 percent utilization, we're somewhere between 2 and 3 cost per delivery.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You already mentioned that this is all beyond visual line of sight, and that the loaders are the only people involved, so no visual observers. Can you talk about how the, mission execution is done with the supervisors and any progress on the 1:many front.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, for us BVLOS is one to many. And for us, that happened at a year ago where we went from many to one. So we had like two point, two point, whatever people per aircraft down to now, actually practically we think it's probably 20 to one because that person, that resource really doesn't have a role. There's no mission planning. There's no nothing that there's really no role for that person, but we're happy to have that person there anyway, to observe and just to be aware. And there's certain areas, like we fly in controlled airspace as well. And Europe has this thing called U-Space. And we've worked with the folks in Google and in Wing with this as well, about de confliction and then bringing that de confliction up a level to ADS B IN to avoid traditional aircraft. Today, we do all in an automated way, but we'd also use that observer to observe the airspace, the ADS B traffic. But like I said, that cost is ultimately going to disappear completely because there's no role really there. Mission planning is automated for us, so when a customer signs up with us we don't see them. We don't talk to them. There's no interaction. they drop a pin where they would like us to deliver. And then we use data to decide if that pin is a safe place or not. And they're in the system. And when the aircraft flies to them, we do check while we're there to make sure the area is clean. In other words, it's less than a 15 degree angle. It's inanimate. There's no people underneath. And all that's automated for us so that there's no observers required. The mission planning is quite interesting actually because there's a couple of things that are surprisingly innovative in that space. I would like to say rocket science, but it's not rocket science, but the flight planning to optimize for energy use, depending on prevailing wind is important. And then we stream the weather from the aircraft that are in the air. So we have very accurate, very localized and very real time weather data that informs the next flight. And so that's a really important optimization for us in both speed of delivery, but also in, in energy drawn, which allows us to have that nice wind envelope or nice wind capability. And so that's very important, but another equally important part of what we do is mitigating ground risks. So, we have an effective population density where we fly. Like it is very populated where we fly. It is very dense. It's as dense as the Bronx or Queens, for example. It is really dense. And we're flying over about 450 houses with every single flight. So we take ground mitigation very seriously. And we do a lot of work there. And one of the feeds that we have is real time location data from users of our code, of our apps that they give us permission to have, and we'll monitor the space for hotspots of people. And that's a really important addition to what we've done. And so that data tells us, like, for example, if there's a beer garden, there's 500 people drinking beer outdoors in the middle of the summer. And we'll know they're there and we'll automate the flight plan around that. And so that for us has proven to be quite an easy thing to build where data didn't exist before. You couldn't really get that insight into where people were before. And in an anonymous way use it to mitigate your flights. So the flight planning is quite interesting in our world. And then the other part is aside from risk, just pure ground risk mitigation. You always think about, you don't want to be flying over the same places all the time. You want to avoid channels down certain areas to overbother people. So we ran, I wouldn't say randomized, but we, in the flight planning, we do a lot of work to reduce the effect of overflights. And that's been a key part of the acceptance aspect of what we're doing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What third party software are you using, Bobby, in that process?

I suppose our strength as a team has been in software, our businesses before have all been software businesses and either way, I think, if there was available software to buy in that space, we'd probably have bought it if it met our needs. But you have to balance always with software. The difference between software that's 95 percent what you need and 100 percent what you need is probably five years. I'm a programmer myself. That's my trade. It's often better just to build a simple system that exactly meets your needs, then adopt a complex system that more or less meets your needs. And in our case, like it is not rocket science where we're building, we're not going to be famous for how awesome our software or our hardware is. That's not what we're going to be famous for. We're going to be famous for our lowest unit cost and our ability to scale that, I think. But to answer your question, we use zero third party software.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm curious, I have to ask, have AI coding assistant technologies made an impact on your organization's ability to write this software?

I wouldn't call it strategic. I would call it an optimization. We're faster writing code. We're better at testing code. It just reduces the time to write code, but once code is written, the AI is no use to you and, we have a mature platform now, so we're more I'd say tinkering, we're optimizing doing small additions and it's very difficult to let an AI into existing code and start adding things. It's more when you write it from the start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Does it tilt the equation between building your own software versus buying software? The decision you would have made three years ago versus the decision that you will make three years in the future on that question.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I don't think so. no, it, it just, when you're assessing the number of people you need, or more importantly, you might get a, someone that's a, an average to strong programmer up a level. You might, get individuals just up a level. Like some of the code I would have written recently, and I use ChatGPT or Copilot, to write some of my own code. I'm writing code now that takes two or three days. That might've taken me a couple of weeks to write before. Mostly now when you're writing code, you're using frameworks or APIs that already exist to take a lot of learning, to take a lot of time to get to use, particularly in the AI and the vision space, and that's just like, I wrote some code recently myself that, that used our security cameras to look for people walking close to an aircraft or onto one of our landing pads. That code took me less than two days to get into production. And that's something that would have taken me a month to write before. And I'm, programming 35 years. So, so think about it that way. And I think that's the only right way to think about it. Just, it just makes existing good programmers faster and better. It doesn't replace the programmer. And so your decision, whether to buy versus build would more be about if somebody has matured a platform already that has done a scale drone delivery operation, it automatically by that fact will have evolved into the right piece of software for us, and I would buy that all day long, but nobody has written a piece of software that runs a drone delivery business at scale yet, except us. And I would say Wing. And so would I buy wing software? Yes. I would buy Wing's software, but I wouldn't buy anyone else's because the software evolves in line with the way you use it and you have to use it in order to develop it, I think.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You mentioned earlier that the consumer pays upwards of maybe 60 percent of the value of the meal with traditional, terrestrial food delivery. How does the drone economics impact, the wallets of the customers and the restaurants?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that, that number comes from actually a McKinsey work in the USA where they measured and it's, yeah, it's a 55 to 60 percent increase. So you buy a pizza for$30, you're paying$45 or a little bit more. In our case, we, I mean, you can get our app, we're charging customers$5 a delivery. And we haven't seen it. That's a little bit more expensive than they might pay for that direct. Here's my delivery fee number on the ticket. but we don't mark up the menu. We don't add surcharges. There's no tip obviously for the drone. So to the customer, actually, we're probably on a par with existing road based delivery, the way they might see it. Now it's only in the USA that everyone pays this gigantic premium on basket. In Europe they're paying about$7 fully loaded, but with tip and all that stuff. And so we're kind of in a par and I think a better question is, do we think there's room to charge more? Or do we need to charge less? and I think that's comes down to elasticity of demand. The drone does, favors there. It's really elasticity of demand on consumption, right? Whether they want the hamburger, whether they're willing to get it delivered or go outside. And if we're much more expensive than road based delivery, that's where the elasticity comes in. They're just going to go back to road based delivery. So I think our industry always needs to be on a par at worst with the existing mode or otherwise better. And then that translates again, back to our unit cost story. We think there's a world where a subscription is a real thing in drone delivery. And that's where we'd like to be. We'd ultimately like every household in the world uses us like Amazon Prime or like Spotify or just part of their monthly, thing in the household. And we think we can get marginal costs down to the point where that will work. And just like Prime or just like Spotify this is an almost inconsequential monthly cost for a household and we can use that to subsidize deliveries and still make our money by charging our partners a commission on basket value. So, we see enormous upside in the take rate or the revenue per delivery without needing to increase the cost to the consumer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How do you expect unit cost numbers that you shared with us to change in the U.

In Europe, that means implementation of U-Space. The regulations are there, U-Space is there. It's just rolling it out, but there's already four or five countries in Europe that will have U-Space this year. And USA, I think that Part 108 is the answer for scale. I don't think 135 is, although there can be the initial growth and scaling in the USA, which I think we'll all do a little bit of, but true, unlimited, unconstrained scaling, I think needs 108. So that's the bits that are out of our control. I think everything else is just execution. It's a capital intensive world, so you need a lot of capital to scale this, even though it's got a good return on it. Like our capital returns in 14 months when we open a new location, it's funded itself after 14 months. But you still, as we're growing a lot, you're going to need, a lot of capital to fund that growth. And I think debt will be a big part of that finance of the aircraft, just like in aviation. So will that be a constraint? Probably not. So then you move on to, again, the things that are in our control, but will quickly get out of our control. If we don't act properly and responsibly as an industry and as individual operators, we'll be punished by regulation. Cities will slow us down like they did the scooter industry. If there's accidents or, anything really that worries people, that will slow us down. So there's a risk there that with the rise of good regulation and the issuing of licenses that people might try to go too fast when they're not ready. They're rushing to get an aircraft to market. They start flying it and they ruin the party for everyone else. If anything slows us down in a material way, that will be it. And will it happen? I doubt it because I think the regulator on both sides of the pond have been very thoughtful about this. And I don't think anyone will be allowed to fly at scale unless they're safe. I just don't see a world where, you're going to have, people allowed to take risk. We obviously are not going to, but I don't think it's a world where you're going to have small operators that raise a seed round and start flying around communities. I don't think that's going to happen at all. I see this being an industry of two or three big players worldwide that will operate properly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby in three years, are you a$15 million,$50 or a$500 million revenue company?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In three years,$100 million plus, I would hope to think, and that could very well be all in Europe as well with some of the contracts we've signed and with the state of the market here, there's every possibility that we could get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And at a hundred million, you're a top three player you're saying in the world?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In drone delivery, we want to be the number one.

If we just got to a thousand of them, that's a billion dollars revenue business and with a contribution that pays for itself in 14 months.

So it isn't, obviously the marginal cost of a unit is there always. We have to manufacture, we have to deploy the boots on the ground. It's a difficult business to scale. I compare us to a Starbucks rollout back to the Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz was on the podcast recently and he broke the numbers down and he said, look, it's half a million for us to generate a million dollars in revenue. It takes two years to pay back. And so he's all about debt financing and trying to go fast, but just it's slow. And I think we won't be as badly affected by that, but that's naturally difficult part of scaling our business. It'll take a while to get to a billion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already touched on this in the conversation about availability, there's, two potential paths that somebody in this industry might take in terms of how deep in a given geography they want to go, whether they want to offer a full capacity service to the customer in one smaller area or expand a little bit more aggressively, but not go perhaps as deep. How do you think about that trade off?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we think about kind of Goldilocks suburb of hundred thousand people and up, potentially we could make slightly smaller ones work. So think 50, 000 people and up. And if you look at that as a filter, there's some other ones like number of restaurants within a hundred meter radius of an anchor restaurant, an anchor tenant, things like that. But if you filter it down, you come to about 10, 000 locations, as I said, in Europe alone, that, that are viable for us to deliver a minimum number of, orders. so, and then if you say, okay, from a strategy point of view, do you want a thin layer? That means then you have that incumbency, advantage in, in many markets at once or as fast as possible, or as you said, do you just own a handful of markets such that they're impenetrable and you don't share them with anyone? And we've seen that play out in food delivery, in the USA and then later on in Europe. We've seen the way it goes. Each market gets its own lead player. And then 10 years on, there's consolidation for efficiency reasons, mostly, and you end up with two or three players in the region, in the continent. And I think there's a potential where if we just stayed in the main European markets, that a smaller business will start up in Sweden and one in Spain or whatever, we'll and for us anyway, we don't want to let that happen. We want to go slightly thinner in more geography, early than going deep. And primarily because we learned from the previous two industry scooters and, food delivery, and you could argue mobility as well. So, on demand rides where if you leave a market alone, something will grow there, and then you're postponing a problem of either competition on economics or, competition on marketing and owning the customer, and I think it's better therefore it's not a black and white, but I think generally we would favor going wider and more shallow. That's a stronger position to be in.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just to make sure I understand when you say that shallower and wider, do you mean not saturating a metropolitan area with presence in every suburb, but, perhaps a few suburbs but you're not thinking that, okay, once I'm in one of those suburbs the shallowness will be a characteristic of the service that you offer such that the risk is that you disappoint customers when they go to the app and say, oh, okay, great. Thanks. I can't get the service. I'm disappointed.

It'll be the aggregators and the vendors won't give them a choice because it's a lot cheaper for them to fulfill that order. So when we say shallow, in an area, it means we go to a large city we'll do all of the suburbs over 50 to a hundred thousand people, but the suburb that's only 25, 000 or less, they're not getting the service because we'd prefer to be growing to the other suburbs in Madrid and Berlin and Stockholm and so on\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right.

You've got these real, tiny little restaurants tucked away in corners. And there's just, you're not going to get an aircraft there, but we'd like to think the 60th or 70th percentile of volume, we'd be able to get, and that in terms of volume of, or choice translates to less than 50 percent of choice. or percentage of restaurants in the area that you'd need to care about. But don't forget it. Go back to coffee.

And as you think about advanced air mobility overall, let's say we break it down to a couple of different buckets. Let's say military drones, let's say commercial drone delivery, whether it be coffee, medical or the like. Or three, let's call it eVTOL, STOL let's say those are three big segments of AAM. What excites you and let's say you were an investor and you had to invest your money. I will assume you will say commercial coffee drone delivery will be an early candidate for investment. What would be next and what would be last?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">My next, without a doubt, in fact, if I wasn't doing this now or I wanted to do something new, it'd be military, defense, look at Anduril or Look at the geopolitical landscape right now and there's a race for sure to arm countries defensively with technology and that technology without a doubt is going to come in the form of flying robots largely, and that's going to have myriad sensor tech, software. It's a software play more than a hardware one. There's obviously a fusing of them, but I find that a really interesting space. And I think, the world is going to be investing a ton of capital in there and the opportunities are enormous and I'm probably unusual in that. I think that's a good thing that industry thrives because it's actually a way to reduce war, not increase war. So that's what I would be doing and I'd be doing it from the USA. cause I think that's where most of the investment's going to happen. So yeah, that's what I would be doing. I wouldn't bet on passenger mobility for a while. I just think it's too hard. I just don't think the physics work well enough yet, and the economics are, I find them difficult to see. You know, they work and it'd be interesting for sure, but I would, I'd be investing in, and working in military defense tech before I'd be doing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As you think about aviation technology, as you think about advanced air mobility, who are the thought leaders out there that you listen to? Who are the people that we say, well, when they talk, that's somebody I give a lot of time to.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You guys,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Nice.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I listen to your pod obviously all the time. I love it. but there's a number of players that, I have huge respect for. I don't want to embarrass them all, but I think, Keller and Zipline has done a super job. I think Adam Woodworth in Wing is an amazing guy. I met him last year. What they've achieved is remarkable. And closer to home, my own team, I have Siggy Zerweckh, 25 years in General Atomics that just, oozes aviation engineering. I'm wowed by the engineers, so you can probably hear that. And thought leadership in the space for me, more important than those, engineering visionary types that I mentioned are the ones that actually understand business as well. And there I'm afraid the industry is guilty of not being real from a business sense, but I have to say, it would be for me, Google and what they've achieved and drone delivery is who I would hold up in the highest regard. And thought leaders, most of your guests, I think, if I look back, you've done a good job of choosing them and I find them really every time I'm surprised, I've never heard of this person. And then suddenly I've met, somebody that's really understands the space better than I could have imagined. So, so many choices.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">One thing I think might be interesting to explore are your thoughts on, the capital that is going to fund the scale out of drone delivery. Right now, it has been primarily funded by venture capital, but clearly there are other types of investors that are going to step in and fund the scale out and thinking about, from your vantage point, who are they, what are the things that they want to see and then what will the financing of the scale out likely look like?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. So I think for who's going to pay to scale it out and what, how does the industry, get the capital it needs to really grow at its natural ability. The numbers are gigantic, right? There's probably a couple of hundred thousand, half a million aircraft are going to be needed in the next five to 10 years, maybe more, maybe less. These are big numbers, in terms of cash needs. I do though, think that the industry lends itself well to venture. We're certainly backed by venture, and we would foresee quite a bit of our future growth. So for us, we'll grow with a blend of debt and venture because we throw off cash now, remarkable as that sounds, we generate cash in a location. So we see ourselves as being probably 60, 70 percent debt funded. So think asset financing type growth and then equity is the other part and private capital for that. So venture. There's an argument that might say, private equity could get there as well. Large private equity firms could get there too. But our ambition is to take the business public as soon as we can. That is a moving feast because public markets are, not in great shape, but by the time we get to that 50 to a hundred million run rate revenue, I think the right thing to do for a business like ours is going to be to IPO because of the profile of investor that's available there. The retail investor will be very important to us as well. The amount of capital we will need to raise to grow it, as I said, to be the leader is enormous. And so it's our ambition to float the company as quickly as we physically can. But I don't think that's in the next two years. It's probably from three years onwards, but there's, there is an outcome where we're floating this business in three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, as we wrap up, what are some of the things that you'd like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the most important thing is the audience to understand that the economics have now been proven for this space. The viability of it has been proven very clearly, that this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That's, that is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think. There has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:26:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Excellent.

Welcome back to The Vertical Space and a terrific conversation with John Langford, CEO of Electra. John has over 30 years of experience in this space, so he knows what's been done and believes he has an elegant, smart approach to our industry with Electra. We talk about the key drivers for, and what becomes first in advanced air mobility and how factors such as market acceptance, use case, certification, tech readiness, and infrastructure requirements dictate what type of vehicles will fly first with commercial relevance. We extensively discussed eSTOL its advantages and disadvantages compared to other proposed vehicle types of today. He explains that most use cases don't need pure vertical or hovering. John explains why Electra decided to use blown lift, STOL technology and hybrid electric power. He discusses how there are no mode changes in Electra's aircraft. And that's why he believes Electra has several advantages. We discuss Electra, its unique characteristics and market fit. Listen to what use cases they're targeting with a soccer field sized operating spaces. And John's response to Luka's questions of the regulatory path of landing and taking off from a soccer field. He also makes clear that there'll be selling and not operating their aircraft. John mentions that pure electric does deliver on the promise of low noise and that the hybrid power may require pure electric in different areas and use cases. We then discuss Aurora Flight Sciences, why they started what they did for the first decade and their challenges, their pivot and trigger point for their success the importance of Global Hawk. And their years of subsequent success and their eventual acquisition by Boeing. Listen, we enjoyed this conversation for a variety of reasons, but one standout is that no other guest has referenced as many of our podcasts and guests as John has in this conversation. So, John, thanks for joining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy this conversation with John Langford, as you innovate in The Vertical Space.

John Langford, welcome to The Vertical Space. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's great to be here. Thank you.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First question we ask everyone, is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, if you judge by the responses to the SFARs that were put out last summer, we at Electra have a pretty different view than much of the industry on what those SFARs said. So I would start with that. There's three big pieces that are fundamental to that in the SFARs. The first is reserves. The second is training and particularly the use of onboard pilots and two seats. And the third is the whole issue of a powered lift category and a special type cert Our response to the SFARs that the FAA put out, the draft for comment, there were sort of two people who responded in favor of it, Electra and the Airline Pilots Association. And then pretty much everybody else came, came out against it and, and saying that it would be, everything from, an inconvenience to an industry killer. And you've had a lot of the other guests, on there who've spoken, to that, in the past. on our part, from Electra's point of view, I think the reserves, the issue of reserves speaks to the whole fundamental issue of electric propulsion, how it really fits into aviation, whether it's ready for prime time, and I assume it's something we'll spend a lot of time on today. But, I do think the issues on reserves, on training, and on the powered lift types are, are three things that clearly the industry and Electra probably take different views on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, just go into a little more detail on each if you could.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it was interesting at the Honeywell summit, which you guys were at and did a piece on. one of the eVTOL's CEOs made a comment to the effect that a requirement for 45 minute reserves, they couldn't even fly for 45 minutes, much less have 45 minutes of reserves. And, we nodded and said, yeah, that's what we've been saying for five or six years. And, and so the question of, do you make airplanes fit into the current regime? And, that includes the sort of safety regime. Or how much do you modify the environment to fit the capabilities or lack of capabilities of the new, aircraft. And I think that's really a really central issue. I can spend, I'd like to spend, in, in just a second, a fair amount of time on, a quick view of electric propulsion. But I think reserves are really fundamental and the reserves are not arbitrary numbers that have been made up, they're something that has been developed over many years and proven by experience. They'll probably will need to be somewhat modified for some of the new capabilities, but, I think you, you face a big sort of dichotomy in the aviation world today where the standards of safety are so high in the Part 25 world, and people project that to all other phases of aviation, and then to start right off with saying, well, we have to modify the existing safety regime in order for these new airplanes to work at all should give people pause. And certainly at Electra, the whole business plan is built around the assumption that we have to operate in today's regulatory environment, in today's airspace because the way you get a return on an investment is to, minimize the amount of time that investment is sitting out there before it can produce revenues. And so our whole business plan is designed to fit into the existing regulatory structure as it is, today. And I think that's a pretty big difference between us and most of the other players in the AAM, the new entrants into the AAM market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, have you heard any credible arguments in favor of changing the reserve requirements? Is there something about the concept of operations or the flight environments that are different from when those reserves were initially determined? And by the way, do you know the history of how the industry converged on 30 minutes for VFR, 45 for IFR\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you've asked the other guests that question, and I'll give you the same answer they did, which is no. ha\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you for listening.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's no real physics based argument and I know a lot of people are going we're gonna be flying short distances and we're gonna know where all the landing sites are all the time but you know as a former glider pilot and somebody at Electra, we spend a lot of time looking at landing sites and when we talk about Electra, that's a big part of what we're doing is opening up new places to operate out of. And while there are a lot of landing places, there are not infinite numbers of possibilities where you can conduct a, a safe, non emergency landing, and we are not trying to build, a chairlift here, right, which operates from one point to another point and nothing in between, we think that what you have to have is a system that can go anywhere. A lot of What Electra's focus is to decarbonize aviation, but also to expand the places aviation can operate. And, and if you're going to do that, you cannot have something where you are built around assumptions that you always know where you're starting. You always know where you're ending and you're operating like a chairlift or something.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You talked about, training as the second.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, the Electra airplane is built with two seats up front. It is intended as a, single pilot operation, nine seat aircraft. But there are two piloting stations up front. Now that initially came from just listening to our customers. Many of whom said, look, the kinds of things we want to do with this airplane includes building time as part of the pilot training pipeline, right, the, and so our customers want to use it as a training tool, a tool for building time as pilots move up from ab initio trainers, which that's not what we're building, but we assume you're already a licensed pilot by the time you get into this. But that you build time in order to move up towards the 1, 500 hour number and, that's part of what the customers want to see. And so that's very consistent, I think, with the FAA's approach that while they think simulator training is great, particularly for upset training, they still want you to have time with an experience, with a, be able to do check rides, right, in the airplane. And, I agree with that. I certainly I've heard the arguments, oh, well, F 35s, are single seat airplanes, but most of the military airplanes historically, even the single seaters, there's some two seat version that you work up to, and the military doesn't start you off in those super high end airplanes. So we looked at it. We think it's just extremely prudent, to be able to use this as a training device, even though it's certified and we expect most of the revenue operations will be flown single pilot. The third is the powered lift certification piece where, you know, it's goes back to the V 22 thing, and this is one of the questions that I ask anecdotally, but have never really gotten a great answer to, which is the V22 and the AW609 have very long, very expensive development histories behind them by teams of people who were well funded and knew what they were doing, and have struggled to get into certification. The AW609 is still working on that and there are unique things about airplanes that have these mode changes that fly from vertical flight profiles to horizontal flight profiles in that transition, and while a lot of that will certainly be masked in the flight control systems, it is still a very different animal. When we built the Electra airplane, one of the key advantages that we think is that there are no mode changes in what we're doing. It's a conventional airplane with a wing, from the beginning of the flight to the end of the flight. and that is, the basis of a lot of, what we think are the both operational efficiencies, which translates into costs, and also operational safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You in one of your presentations, John, caught my attention.

The president came out to give a speech close by and Marine One flew right into the terminal there and it was a helicopter older than, well, not all of us on this call, but many of the people who work at Electra, those helicopters are older than, but yeah, absolutely, if the concept's not safe enough for the president of the United States to fly on, why is it safe enough for me to put my kid or my mother on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, John, an elemental stem cell question, what comes first in advanced air mobility? What drives the need for the first commercial vehicle?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it all starts with an air vehicle that works, and I can't think of another time in aviation where we're talking about certification and huge expenditures on new infrastructure for an airplane no passengers have flown on and we have no passenger feedback about whether people are even going to want to fly on these aircraft. So I'm a big believer that what comes first is you gotta make the airplanes work, and that means not flying them just in private tests, but actually in public use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the point you need to be able to roll out a vehicle that's actually going work. So many the use cases in advanced air mobility you would think could be more economically and safely addressed with eSTOL versus eVTOL. Talk about that a little bit. You've already highlighted in this conversation, there's a lot of challenges with vertical lift. You talked about cost but I'm sure you will. But there's a safety concern in the transition, but it seems like an awful lot of the missions in regional air mobility, and in other areas that they can be better served by the eSTOL.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, let me talk a little bit about how we came to the idea of Electra and it was through building a lot of eVTOL airplanes. At my previous company, Aurora Flight Sciences, we can talk more about Aurora in a second, but we were primarily in a rapid prototyping operation, we built all kinds of advanced aircraft concepts, and that's what we offered to our customers. And we did electric airplanes really from day one, or we tried to, right? The very first airplanes we started building in 1989 for high altitude use were intended to be electric originally. In fact, battery electric using, one shot lithium thionyl chloride batteries to, to get to very high altitude so you didn't have to build an air breathing propulsion system that worked at 85, 000 feet. In about the mid 2000s, starting in about 2002 and then flying in 2009, we did a hybrid electric airplane called Excalibur for the Army that had a gas turbine and a generator and three electrically driven lift fans that also had batteries. And then we did a program for DARPA that was called the XV 24 Lightning Strike, which was a very large turbine driving generators, 3 megawatts worth of electricity, driving 28 fans buried in the wing. It ended up being a tilt wing to get the, the high speed and the VTOL, working together in that. And as part of that program, we also did a subscale demonstrator, which was purely battery powered and autonomous. And we used that to demonstrate the full flight envelope. And then we went from there into a program with Uber, which for an airplane that we called the Pegasus and Boeing called the PAV. And then we did a proprietary program with, with Porsche. So we built a lot of eVTOLs of almost every configuration you can imagine and everyone that's out there and some that aren't. And when we went to go study how to put it into production, we spent a lot of time trying to come up with a design that could beat existing airplanes. I was in a lot of design reviews in which I would go, look, we're not going to spend all this money, hundreds of millions of dollars, to come up with an electric airplane that doesn't have the performance of a Robinson, okay? We never were able to do that with, battery electric designs, but what did happen was some guys up at MIT, John Hansman and Mark Drayla and one of their grad students, Chris Corton, began to say, hey, look, for most use cases, it does not have to be strictly vertical, right? What you really care about is the runway independence. There are some cases where you have to hover, where you need that pure vertical, or you need that pure hover capability. You always will, and so those will be the province of, of, helicopter designs, but in most other cases, every other case that doesn't have that absolute requirement for vertical or hovering, you're better off with the physics of a wing, and a wing is essentially a thrust multiplier, whereas with a VTOL design, all of the lift is provided by the thrust, so you know, you have to have thrust higher than your weight. And in a normal airplane, what a wing does is act as a thrust multiplier. So if you have a 10 to 1, lift to drag ratio, you can get away with 1 10th the thrust that you would need if you were trying to take off vertically. And, that gives you a physics advantage that, is why most airplanes that you see are, what we call CTOL, or you use a wing throughout the entire flight envelope. The science that Electra is harnessing in this is a technique called blown lift, which is something that has been around for, oh, 50 years or more, since NASA in the 60s and then 70s really pioneered it, and the French and the Japanese, and there were some Air Force programs that looked at this. By blowing the wing, bathing the wing in carefully designed flap systems and with the higher velocity air from the propulsion system, you could get lift coefficients that were multiples of what you could get from a conventional sort of static configuration system. So instead of getting, a lift coefficient of two and a half, you could get lift coefficients approaching ten. And if you can do that, you can fly much slower, and if you can fly more slowly, you can take off and land in very short distances. Blown lift as it was developed in the 60s and 70s was always that it was being done with gas turbines. And gas turbines, are basically, well, if you look at the history of CTOL airplanes, we've gone from four engines to three engines to two engines, and people would go to one gas turbine if they could, obviously they don't because of the redundancy need to be able to lose one at takeoff, but, you essentially pay for the maintenance cost by the gas turbine. So the blown lift wants continuous blowing across the wing in an infinite number of propulsors and the gas turbines want to have one propulsor. And so that was fundamentally the problem of, the early blown lift designs was they were never economical matching with the propulsion systems that are available. The insight that Hansman and Drayla and Corton brought to this was that distributed electric propulsion actually solves that problem. And so with the electric motors, you can now have good specific power and good efficiencies on a number of small propulsors and, the exact number you have to optimize, but a lot more than two, we have eight on the airplanes that we're doing, which matches very well to the requirements of blown lift. And so that's the fundamental physics behind what Electra is trying to do. It gives you a two to three times the useful load fraction compared to a vertical lift design, for a given vehicle weight and a given mission. And then we spend that advantage in a couple of ways. We spend some of it in, we have a better useful load fraction than a VTOL design. But we also spend some of it in things like development costs and in manufacturing costs that we're focused on how you reduce the non recurring costs by not being highly vertically integrated, but by using more COTS components, and I don't mean commercial COTS, just other aerospace level components, and we can talk more about that, and then in the recurring, we're, we have not settled yet in the production of how much is going to be composite and how much is going to be metal, but, we don't have to use the ultimate lightweight solutions that the VTOL folks get driven to because we have that physics advantage that we can spend in a couple of different ways. And overall, we think it's going to make a much more cost effective proposition both for the operators and as a business than anything else we have been able to come up with, and that includes, as I said, looking at pretty much every eVTOL concept, out there. So that was the genesis of when I, left Aurora and started Electra about three years ago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So John, you were looking for design and you saw this insight that distributed electric propulsion enables a really effective blown wing design. What beyond that helped you refine that down into a product and commit to that product? What mission set did you want to go and target with this aircraft?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we started with the whole suite of urban and regional air mobility missions. One of the beautiful things about the eSTOL, particularly when you couple it with the hybrid electric propulsion, essentially the blown lift gives you the very short runway capability, and the hybrid gives you the ability to go long distances, and in this case, long distances is hundreds of miles. And so we look at the whole set of missions. One of the things we, announced this week is we've crossed the 2, 000, pre orders, or letters of intent for the 9 seat airplane that we're developing. And you just look at the range of folks who are buying that and what they are planning to do with it. And it basically breaks out into helicopter operators. Our launch customer was Bristow, one of the world's premier helicopter operators. The people who really understand both the pluses, but also the minuses particularly in terms of cost and noise of helicopters today, and we believe we can operate at 70 percent less direct operating costs than the helicopters they're flying today, and to get in and out of all of the heliports, for example, that ring Manhattan. And so the first people who are really interested in that are the helicopter operators, right? Then we move into, the second category, sort of regional air service providers who want to expand the number of destinations that they go to. The kinds of things that we're offering, if you can get in and out of a soccer field sized location there are a lot of things you can do around the world. Our level zero requirement, as we call it, is to be able to get in and out of Wall Street Heliport, right? That facility is what we have chosen as sizing our capability, that's where the 300 foot by 100 foot operating space comes from in our requirements is that existing piece of infrastructure at the Wall Street Heliport. And there's space at the other heliports that ring Manhattan for that as well, although like at 30th Street West, you can't actually fly directly into that today. There's a barge that's big enough that would have to be refurbished, and there's a horizontal space parallel to the river at 30th Street that is large enough, but has a temporary building in the center of it, but the Wall Street Heliport you can fly in and out of today is the idea, and everybody in this market is talking about the airport shuttle mission to go from Wall Street to JFK or to Newark or whatever. That's what Blade does today and we start with that mission and we can certainly do that mission and we can do it at significantly lower cost than Blade is doing it today with the helicopters. But then we can keep going with the airplane and you can go to the Hamptons or to Martha's Vineyard or Boston. Or you can keep going further and you can go to Washington, D. C. We spend a lot of time working that route between New York and Washington. Because if you look at that today, it's about four hours at a minimum. No matter how you go, whether you drive, take the train, fly commercial, it all starts at four hours and goes up depending on what kind of delays you may encounter. And the only way to, to really save time is to get in closer. This is not a case where going faster in the airplane really makes that big of a difference. You can take a private aircraft from D. C. up to New York, but you're going into Teterboro or Westchester and you've still got to get down to Manhattan, so our view is you've got to be able to get into Manhattan with whatever device you're talking about and that's what our level zero requirement is. Once you can do that, then you can go all kinds of places. You can go to, places like Santa Monica, which are existing airports, but which, carriers like JSX can't get into today, but which they would love to access and which we can because of both the space and the noise that we the quiet operations and the short field operations will be able to do non interfering approaches into places like into big airports JFK, but will also be able to operate off of the tops of parking garages which will allow us, we think, to get into places like Tyson's Corner, which is, a couple miles from where I'm sitting. It'll allow us to operate out of big warehousing distribution centers. It'll allow us to go into destinations, like islands that don't have airports that might have ferry service or helicopter service, but don't have an airport for a fixed wing service. There's actually a lot of those out there. Obviously, it allows you to do every road as a runway. today roads are emergency runways for airplanes, of course. But in the medical evacuation or in the defense applications, we use a lot less road than others. And the 300 by 100 foot is about the size of a soccer field, and if you go and look around the world at how many soccer fields there are and where they are it's amazing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If I was building an aircraft that was range constrained, I could only effectively go 25 or 30 miles in my mission, then yeah, I would focus on these urban centers finding a way to make that mission profile work from downtown to the airport and all of that. But that comes with so much baggage and you have an aircraft that is far more versatile. And so why even focus on those missions first? The last few things that you mentioned, going to places that people want to get to, but there isn't a small airport there, to me, that seems like such a layup for you. And why not focus on that first? Or maybe you don't care. Maybe you're just in the business of selling airframes and the customers will fly them where they will.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the other things that we are adamant about is that we're not the operator. We're not trying to be our own user. We are going to, established other customers and that's part of that 2000 pre orders is it's something like 40 different customer organizations, and one of the beauties of those pre orders is it puts you inside an NDA veil that you can, operate where you can tell them what you're really doing and they can tell you what they want to do and what they're really doing and the things that they want, the features that they want on their product and, and that is, that's basically what we're focused on is listening to the customers, and making sure we deliver what they want. At the same time, you have to have a visionary element as well to it. It's the Steve Jobs iPhone, analogy, right? That people aren't really good at market research because it doesn't really help you on things that don't exist today because people don't really know what they want if they've never had one. And so we're balancing that, right, between the existing missions, which will be the early adopters, some of which are even literally direct replacements for airplanes that are in the fields today, and the expansion markets that are enabled by the new capabilities that airplane offers. We think that's one of the things that makes it such a robust plan, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. think you're bringing forward a versatile aircraft that you put it in the hands of the customers and let them show how they're going to use it, rather than, of the other companies in the space being so prescriptive with this incredible new set capabilities. And they have very narrow vision how end users going access. I'm a big fan of letting the industry discover how customers are going to use it by putting a versatile platform in their hand and something that's really multi mission capable and then watch them apply it and learn from that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We absolutely agree with you.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>what is the, regulatory path to landing an aircraft in a soccer field?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you can do it today with a helicopter, right? It's the same, structure there is on, operating on the same flight rules and stuff as helicopters are today. The, the joke in the helicopter the field is you can land a helicopter anywhere once and, and honestly, as we look at our business plan, particularly for some of the things like where you're dealing with, establishing commuter services to towns, to communities that don't have an existing airport, or you're going to do, package e pickup or delivery to not just between distribution centers, but even to retail stores, that we think that the local regulations will be an important part of this. And that's why we go back constantly to the noise, right? And why we go back constantly to the need to get these things out there and, and begin to demonstrate. And, I think what happened a few weeks ago in New York when Joby and Volocopter did demonstration flights off of the Wall Street heliport and they were very warmly received. And there's always some laws of unintended consequences right, when people say hey that's really, yeah, that's really quiet, that's all these other guys, right, say, now that option exists, we're not going to let into our space, That\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>be\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>things that you see,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, I want to ask you a quick question given you brought up the noise. what's your noise signature versus Joby? say\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>signature is.

And, there's probably people listening to podcast right now, some of whom may be critics of eSTOL. So give a little bit of a flavor first of all, what's the noise difference? Would electric eVTOL companies say, I have a significant noise advantage over eSTOL, or at least a hybrid eSTOL, which you have? And then just give us a quick rundown on what would the critics of eSTOL say overall?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, let me start out with the promise of lower noise is definitely one of the promises of electric that I think electric can deliver on, right? There's a lot of hype and promise around electric aviation in general, much of which I think will be very hard for that people to deliver on, and we can talk about that more in a second, but I think noise is one of the ones that really will, because the motors are definitely quieter. If you have a lot of small props, you can have lower tip speeds, and then the design of the props is, advanced quite a bit. So there, there's no question that these things are going to be a lot quieter. Will the difference between the eVTOL and an eSTOL pure electric mode, will you be able to tell? I doubt it. I don't have specific numbers today. It's all aspect, angle dependent and stuff. But I will say that in the flying we're doing today, we do have a chase plane and you never hear the electric airplane if the chase plane is in the air. We are collecting noise data on that, and it's great, and, we're super excited about that. I think the electric airplane promise of lower noise will be delivered on by everybody. On the hybrid, obviously we have a generator on there, a turbo generator in our case. It's small and we're working to make it quiet on the two seat tech demonstrator that we're flying today it was designed to be inexpensive, so that turbo generator is not particularly quiet, but the airplanes are designed to be flown, and we've tested this, that's why we did our first flight purely electric, because, we are working to make sure in all modes, it's extremely quiet, but we recognize that there are some cases when you want to be, completely our airplane can operate without the turbo generator on. And the analogy I give on that is, is, with your, a Prius, right? When you pull out of the driveway, you're probably operating purely electric, and when you get out on the freeway, the, gas engine kicks in and that's how you get the range. And I think operationally you're going to see a similar thing with the hybrid airplanes. In cases where there's an extreme noise sensitivity, like some of the military missions or some of these close in neighborhood missions, you'll probably will be flying them purely electric for the part where you're low. The other big thing of course besides emitting noise is how much are you emitting at the source, and then what is the trajectory, right? One of the ways that the big turbofans really benefited noise reduction on current jets, of course, is that when you had two of them, you climb a lot faster than the older jets did, and therefore you get away from the ground, and therefore you expose a lot less, surface area. And the eSTOL does that as well with the steep approaches in both, both for takeoff and landing, that, that's another factor in how you minimize the ground exposure. It's also another thing most people don't realize about the eVTOL airplanes, which is that everybody pictures them taking off and landing straight up and down. That's not how helicopters work, but the big thing on the eVTOLs is you take off vertically, but then you've got to get on the wing as fast as possible\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's talk about eSTOL safety case and how you are going to approach safe, slow flight, let's take, final approach with the aircraft. What is final approach speed and what are the safety concerns you and the team had to overcome with that and what do you expect is going to need to be accounted for in the certification process for this? And we talk about, slow speed control, we talk about wind shear, talk about power loss on final approach. Walk us through that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. One of the interesting things about a powered lift airplane, about the eSTOL operation, is that the stall speed is no longer a function just of the geometry of the airplane, the way it is in a normal conventional CTOL airplane. What's the flap setting, right? And that's, that's going to pretty much determine the stall speed. In our case, it's also a function of throttle setting, because of the blown lift. With the blown lift, you're flying at speeds considerably below the power-off stall speed. We are expecting to be operating, 30 to 35 knots in the approach regime of these airplanes. That means that if you're coming into a place like the Wall Street Heliport, you have to have multiple levels of redundancy in the powertrain. And that is one of the beauties of, the, of distributed electric.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, so approach to safety is that we're not to allow the power to fail through redundancy and reliability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's eight motors, there's four batteries, there's two generators, and there's one turbine in, in those, and it's sized so that if you lost the turbine on a critical part of the approach you have, more than enough battery capability. Even if one of the battery systems fails, one of the strings, one of the buses, you can lose two motors in any, scenario. And that's to handle the extreme STOL, and obviously, one of the other beauties of this design at its heart, it's a conventional airplane with a fixed wing and so A complete power loss situation in a a battery vertical lift airplane, you're gonna come down. And, in the electro eSTOL concept, you're going to glide down. That's a much safer situation. We saw that just last week, in Loudoun County, not far from here. a Caravan coming out of Dulles. And so, we think that's an important, safety feature.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the other aerodynamic risk factors in slow speed flight in the traffic pattern on final, that your aircraft needs to designed around?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, obviously one of the things about flying slow is wind and turbulence. One of the really great things about the electric propulsion, and this is again why we think it's the marriage of distributed electric and blown lift that really is the enabler to make all this work, is that you can now use the different electric propulsors as part of your control system, and in fact, we, we do that in the design that the differential thrust, for example, is mixed right in to, the yaw control and also into the roll control and it's actually a strong pitch actuator as well and well, so you have tremendous control effectiveness that you don't have in a normal airplane, where the control get squishier the slower you go, and ultimately, you lose control authority. That's, that does not happen on these blown lift airplanes. That's one of the advantages of this is that you have very powerful control actuators all the way through the flight envelope. And we plan to use them. That's one of the ways you handle, gusts and turbulence and things like that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so how does this apply toward preventing one wing from stalling and causing a spin and et cetera? Will this system be designed to account that and prevent that as part of the envelope protection?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is power by wire, first off, and then the entire airplane is a fly by wire, and while I think pretty much every, you get arguments about how much autonomy people have in the AAM space, but I think pretty much everybody buys into the idea that it's a fly by wire system, and so much so that we often don't comment on that or talk about it. But, I would just note that at the moment there are no Part 23, certified fly-by-wire systems. There are in military jets, there are in bigger airplanes, but the certification piece of that is, important and is significant. It doesn't have challenges of autonomy, the unknown pieces but it also shouldn't be taken for granted. What you get out of FBW is the ability to have protection throughout it, just as you do on the A320 or the big jets. And that'll be a big part of this. Absolutely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. And then with respect to my last, question on this is, low level wind shear. What does that present for this type of very slow flight? What type of risk does low level wind shear present? The airplane perhaps finding itself on short final, an increased sink\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you need to be especially wary of at these types of speeds how do you solve for\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>that? That, that is one of the things that we are looking at It's related to the other piece of this is the precision touchdown, part, that it's, it's pretty easy to take off of a, in 150 feet on a 300 foot space, it's pretty easy to take off in those conditions, and landing, if you need only 100 or 150 feet of ground roll, that's not too bad. But if you've only got 300, you've got to hit the space exactly. And so that's one of the real, that we see as one of the challenges in this. And that's where, while there's no autonomy per se in this airplane, there's a lot of automation and a lot of work is going into the pilot guidance and exactly what roles the pilot is playing and the flight computer is playing. Hitting a precise touchdown point. There is no flare planned for what we're doing, okay, so we come straight in, if you have an aim point, we're gonna hit that, but your point is, well, do you know the atmospheric profile between here and there? And that is a research topic on whether we are going to, in some cases, need you know, a LIDAR profiler or some kind of atmospheric profiler in these, very very short spaces. We are trying hard not to because we are big believers in light infrastructure but we have not ruled out that you might need to put some kind of atmospheric profiler at these very small spaces, particularly if there's large building obstacles or stuff around, so you could feed forward, essentially in real time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, so you're saying it's really these extremely small landing spaces where this becomes stringent because otherwise if there's wind shear day and you're landing on thousand foot runway you just increase your approach speed like airplane would you account for it that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, exactly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, tying back to one of the comments Peter made earlier about the market opportunity outside of these 300 foot balanced field lengths, have you given thought to the idea that maybe this is too complex tackling some of these issues and there's enough of a market opportunity in some conventional missions where you're introducing an aircraft that has significant direct operating costs savings. So, why not go and utilize existing 2000 foot runways and avoid these kinds of safety issues that we just talked about and go serve those missions and there's plenty of those. What is the benefit of having the capability to land on a 300 foot field? And, what does that translate directly to market opportunities?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We've looked at this, it's a great question, and we've looked at this, in sort of, I'll broaden the question to how you use blown lift, and, the NASA X 57 and the Electra eSTOL set out to use blown lift in two different ways, right? Essentially what the physics of the blown lift do is make the wing look aerodynamically like it's larger than it physically is, and we use that to have a large wing which gives slow speeds and therefore short takeoff and landing, and the X 57 was focusing it more on CTOL mode and have efficiencies in cruise. And I think that, where you set that knob depends on the mission that you're trying to do. beat\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'd be really curious to understand, a customer of yours that's in the logistics space, that's in the Caravan space, for instance today, how do they think of the added benefit of, this kind of short field takeoff and landing capabilities, and whether they would be eager to go through the, trouble of setting up a private field and creating, presumably this needs to be an available service, and so you need to be able to go in and out in all weather conditions including IFR, and so that means developing procedures for those airfields. So why not just go to a nearest 2000, foot runway, wherever your current operations exist and utilize an aircraft that is much cheaper and easier to operate?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>48:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Couple of, couple answers to that. The first is that in our analysis, it's not a lot cheaper than, the actual cost for being able to do, both what we would call a very short field urban air mobility mission. Short field, the helicopter, analogy mission, versus the the, sort of Caravan mission on that. And our analysis is that we can do both, but the kinds of things we're looking at, the time savings, I go back to the time savings comes from getting in close from starting and, ending your journey, close to the customer's point of origin and point of destination and, yes, there's an argument that, oh, there's lots of underutilized airports in the U. S. Yeah, and most of them are places people don't want to go. Okay, that's why they're underutilized. Their warehouse is not on an airportand there's 4000 warehouses in the Amazon network alone and the Walmart network alone and you've got 10 or 12 of those players in the US economy and so you have tens of thousands of these middle mile logistics places you'd like to go your you're not going to build conventional airports at all of those. Are you going to be able to take a piece of the existing parking lot and, stripe it off and fence it off and operate aircraft out of there? We think the answer to that question is yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, that's actually one of my questions is, if you have a customer that has these types of facilities and maybe they're, well located next to a highway network, but they want to bring an air capability into those locations and they have the lot or they have open space, walk us through what it would take for them to, be able to fly in and out of there. Do they have to go and deal with zoning county ordinances? Does it happen at the state level? I think a lot of us in the audience know what the fAA has to say about this, paint that picture for types of customers. how easy or hard that going to be for to do?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. Well, yeah, well, and you had Dave Stepanek on, from Bristow, and Dave talked about a lot of this in his interview. What Bristow is looking at is not necessarily flying an E STOL airplane onto an existing oil and gas platform. That's probably going to stay as a helicopter mission, although Electra also says, well, here's how much a barge costs, and a barge that you can operate our airplanes off of is, is actually not an expensive proposition, but be that as may, Bristow's current market, is to expand into exactly that, or in current vision, I, and I not putting words in Dave Stepanek's mouth, he said this on his podcast with you, is exactly to expand into some of these middle mile kinds of things. And who better than helicopter operators to address those questions that you're talking about? We do not have the answer to every question that you answered in there, but you can do all of these missions today with helicopters. It's just not, economically feasible and with the noise, we think not very, sustainable in that. But, you could do air service with helicopters into these distribution points but we think for the middle mile, you need to do a couple of thousand pounds and, we think the economics begin to really work on this size airplane more than some of the smaller UAVs. What's the interesting really going to be to routine drone deliveries in residential areas? We're hoping it's where everybody goes, oh, they notice it the first few times you Do it and then it goes to a background effect.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One question that I wanted to ask was, what extent, John you considered general aviation an an interesting use case. You mentioned, the three up front, but I haven't heard GA that to me is, a really interesting market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, GA is, it goes back to a lot of your autonomy guests that you've had on and discussions. At Aurora, we had a program called Centaur, and Aurora still has that going, which is, a DA 42 that was modified to be an optionally piloted airplane, where there was a human in the left seat and a robot in the right seat, and we did it in a way that it didn't void the normal category certification of the airplane when you put the robot in, and we spent a lot of time making the robot removable and in a way that didn't void the normal category cert, so you could fly it manned in a normal category, you could fly it, robotically in a, in an experimental category then, and we demonstrated that. I personally flew on one of those. And it's pretty weird sitting behind the robot while the robot flies it. There was a safety pilot, of course, on the airplane, but all they did was avoid other traffic right. That was the, their role on that was the detect, see and avoid. And so, I always thought that the real role for autonomy in the US airspace system is really in the revitalization of general aviation. I, I think that's where it's going to ultimately make a huge difference, because if you look at it for the last 50 years, it's been a steady decline of the number of rated pilots, Learning to fly safely in the United States is a little bit of stick and rudder and a lot of procedures. Where a lot of the costs, the proficiency and the, I'll just call it the hassle, comes from. And that's the place that I think autonomy can help the most. So I'm a big believer on general aviation. When I was at Aurora, we were looking at, what it took to get an STC on the automation package and when you talked to Rob Rose a lot of his comments are very familiar, because we looked at all of that and worked on all of that at Aurora, with the goal of getting to a general aviation airplane that you could fly with the kind of, training and proficiency that goes into a driver's license and not what you currently have to have for\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You brought up Aurora, Tell us some highlights from Aurora that you think apply to Advanced Air Mobility that you think our audience be interested to hear about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the first comment I would make about Aurora is that it started out to be an environmental company That the mission of Aurora Flight Sciences, when we started in 1989, was to do robotic airplanes for global climate change research. And for our first decade, that was pretty much our exclusive focus of trying to build new tools for atmospheric scientists to probe the stratosphere. And that turned out to be challenging, primarily in terms of the financial support that is out there for climate research. People seem to have lots of opinions on the climate and it's proven to be remarkably difficult to build a company around, um, the, environmental research tools and the exploration of the stratosphere. Aurora pivoted, about, 8 to 10 years into its history to being what I would call more conventional UAV markets, meaning that we got into the defense sector, prior to 9 11. And the program that I think really made Aurora, which a lot of people probably don't fully appreciate, was Global Hawk. We bid that as a program to DARPA, or DARO, back in 1994. And the only requirement that they put out was a 10 million unit flyaway price. That was the firm requirement. We took that seriously, and we bid that, and we told them, here's what we think you can do for a 10 million UFP. Bob Mitchell, who is one of the absolute, both aeronautical and management geniuses of our business, who was the president of Teledyne Ryan at the time, built the airplane the Air Force actually wanted. And, of course, they won that., Aurora pivoted quickly and got onto that team as building composite parts, for Bob and his team on the Tier 2 Plus. And then it went from Tier 2 Plus to Global Hawk, from DARPA to the Air Force, from Teledyne Ryan became Northrop then 911 happened and all of a sudden, Global Hawk was a very large program About two weeks before the 911 attacks Aurora put in a bid to Northrop at the time, to build all of the composite parts except the wing, on Global Hawk, and we had won it. And all of a sudden, that was just a huge program. It was very painful, a lot of learning and rapid growth into that, but that was the program that really made Aurora transition from being a, a small, shop that had been pursuing the environmental market into the serious player it became in the aerospace market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And John, how has Boeing benefited from the acquisition of Aurora? What was the rationale behind that? Some would say that one of the reasons that this transaction happened was because Boeing wanted to kill the D8 Double Bubble who compete with the 737. What do you think about that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I, I'm a huge admirer of Dennis Mullenberg, and Dennis did a great interview again on your show, and I think in that interview a lot of Dennis's vision and enthusiasm really came through very clearly in that. And we were part of that. Dennis was out to transform Boeing. He realized that just because you're the best in the game today doesn't mean you will be in 50 years. And our job was part of that portfolio, was to be a disruptive innovation force at Boeing that was looking at generations of airplanes in the future. And, and Dennis, I just think is a terrific, visionary. He was the driver behind the Aurora acquisition. And so Aurora's role was to become an autonomy center, a prototyping center. Boeing had a lot of aspirations. Boeing did not and still does not have a Part 23 division, a division that can do Part 23 airplanes. At various times they've said that's not a market we want to be into, but other times they have been interested in it, so there were a lot of pieces that combined into there. Absolutely true that the D8 was the thing that got that round of the discussions that it led to the acquisition did start with teaming discussions on this NASA, Advanced Concept Demonstrator back in 2016 or so, came out of the NPLUS 3 program and the D8 was a program that had been led by MIT and that Aurora had worked on and was very interested in. But that was, that was a piece of the discussion. Aurora and Boeing had a number of previous programs for a number of different customers, several of them in high altitude, long endurance things where we were both competitors, but also we were, suppliers to them on, on high altitude programs, what the world came to see as Phantom Eye. There were programs before Phantom Eye, but The, Phantom Eye was the one that that became publicly announced and flew. And, you know, Aurora did the wing on Phantom Eye. We did all the engine testing. This was back in 2007/2008. So there was a pretty long history of collaboration working for and with Boeing before the discussions that were kicked off in 2016, that were in fact centered initially around the D8, but broadly they were centered around Dennis's vision of how you built a great aerospace company for the 22nd century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How do think that plan is shaping up?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I don't think it's any secret that Boeing has had some tough times, the Max and COVID were a double whammy. that, that hit them and all the big players particularly hard. I'm impressed. I think Aurora's doing well under Boeing. And I was really pleased at the AIAA SciTech, just a couple of weeks ago here that the DARPA TTO director on stage, publicly commented on how well he thought the Aurora Boeing merger and integration was goIng. Usually we see, big companies buy the little companies and then smother them with bigness. that's in he said, I don't see that happening at Aurora. I see Aurora doing really well and keeping their small company mojo while still doing a good job of reaching deep into the Boeing system for talent and resources. And, I think when your customers are saying that, that's what you want, right? You want it, you're, we're all in business, for our customers. and, I was really pleased to hear that. So I think that's a great testimonial for everybody who's worked hard to make that integration\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the comments you made earlier I'd like to get your further thoughts on. Aurora being great in research and development, but never really building more than one of anything and then to see you move into Electra starting a company that really is very much product focused. What are some of the insights in terms of commercializing technologies that you have learned along the way at Aurora that you internalized as you started to build out Electra.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the company culture is something that is, very difficult to change in, any entity even in small organizations, particularly in large organizations, it's hard to change the culture once it's, locked in. And, you get really good at doing one thing, and you know, Clay Christensen said that your, disabilities are a byproduct of your strengths, right? that what you're good at also defines what, you're not good at. Cause you have all these systems and processes in Aurora's case that are set up to do new things quickly but not to do the same thing, over and not to, support products in the field if from Something at Aurora, I you know I always kind of regretted that. I mean to make a real impact you have to not just invent new things, you have to fuse them into the world where people can use them to make a real impact. And that's what I wanted to do with, Electra. So Electra is not at all competitive with Aurora in terms of company mission.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John. you've had a lot disciples from Aurora who are in Advanced Air Mobility. Who's doing the most interesting work?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the things I am most proud of, from the Aurora experience is what I call the Aurora Diaspora, of people who came to Aurora right out of school, for whom Aurora was their first job, and I I was their first boss, who have gone on to be CEOs or founders of companies. It, the list is like 15 or so. It's amazing. And a number of them have been on your show. So, Brian Yutko, one of the true stars of his generation you who was, what or one of the most rapidly advanced people in the history of Aurora, ran the R&amp; D center in Cambridge, and then was the, head of all the product development. He's now the CEO at Wisk, but Paul Eremenko hired him out the aero department. His first job was on the goldenEye at, at Aurora. He's, had a incredible career at Google and Airbus and, now Universal Hydrogen and, Billy Thalheimer, at Regent, Adam Woodworth, who, was our go to guy for small UAVs at Aurora, until, Google lured him to the West Coast, and now he's the CEO at Wing. it goes on. one of the, one of the bigger ones was Insitu.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let me ask you a quick question. John, if we had Brian and Billy in room right now and you closed the door and said, okay, guys, here are the things you're doing really well and here are a couple of, things you should take a look at. What would be one two things they're doing really well? What are one or two pieces of advice give to Brian and Billy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I wouldn't try to give them advice.

It's not about burning people down, to build a successful company. It's about, helping everybody reach their full potential. And, we always said that the, you hire on talent. And then you find a role for people in the, business. And I think the string of people who have gone on to start their own businesses or become CEOs of either their own business or a business that somebody else helped start, is something that I'm very proud of and that speaks well to that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Such a universal truth. And, now you're embarking on a similar journey with Electra. When you look that journey, how do see the capital requirements for bringing Electra Aero's first product to market and, into reasonable scale production? How is this going to compare to what an eVTOL project? We all have good examples and familiarity with what those cost. How much capital have you raised so for Electra?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, one thing my mother taught me, you never talk about money in public so I'm not going to give you a straight answer on that question. I will say the total we're looking is based on things like what Pilatus spent to bring the PC 24 into certification. And, Pilatus is one of my favorite companies. I, I think they are just a fantastic example. And, their airplanes are wonderful. And they did the PC 24 for somewhere around 400 million or something like that. And I think that is a reasonable number to bring something in this class range into, certification. That's a 20 percent of what some of these other guys are spending on on this and frankly, I don't know how they have 700 people.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, to get the certification, if you can do it for about 400, I'd say that's, 25 percent of the cost of what these other players are going to take. Maybe 20%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we've lot questions John. Is there else that we haven't talked about you'd like to discuss?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I wanted to just touch on the STEM and, diversity and inclusion element of, industry, which is one of the things that, I am really, passionate about. We touched on it a little bit in that, how you grow leaders and how you help people develop to their potential. But, that starts really young, and I am a huge believer in both the sort of workforce development, which is the pragmatic way to look at STEM, and then the, the sort of, it's the right thing to do, sort of morality angle of STEM, and, I think that is just so the important and foundational to everything all of us in this industry are doing. I grew up in the sixties when Apollo was on the evening news every night, it was the good news story of the 60s and it attracted a whole generation of people into the workforce. Today, we don't have that as much from and we can't take for granted as an industry that people are going to want to just flock to what we're doing. I think we're all made up of total aviation people and, true believers, but we can't just depend on that cadre of folks. We have to be, evangelists in this for, our profession. And, that's part of why I've been very passionate about, programs like FIRST Robotics or like the Team America Rocketry Challenge and why our family has gotten involved with Estes Industries because I see the hobbies like model rocketry as being incredible, STEM development and workforce development, tools.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:09:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Five, ten years from now, how is world different than most people are expressing it? You've heard sounds like just about all of our podcasts, and you're hearing them pontificate on what's going to happen in the next 5 10 years in this world of advanced air mobility. How was your than what you're hearing of our guests?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first, I will caveat that, the reality is I have no idea, right, because, it's really tough to have a crystal ball like that. I tend to think, though, that being a big student of history, that, I look at the VLJ market, I look at the commercial drone market, I lived through the hype and excitement, that surrounded both of those, and if you look at those, you think, well, there'll be few players that emerge in a dominant position there'll be a handful of zombies and there'll be an awful lot of roadkill. I think the big outstanding question for me is whether the eVTOLs are going to end up being the aeronautical version of the Segway. And there was a great article in Wired magazine a few years ago that was titled, well, that didn't work. The Segway is a technological marvel. Too bad it doesn't make any sense. And it, goes back and dissects the, I'll call it the rise and fall of the Segway, which was, an amazing invention by an amazing person. Dean Kamen is truly remarkable. And what he's done in his career, and particularly with FIRST Robotics, I think is nothing short of amazing, but the Segway, was, we weren't going to be walking anymore because we were all going to be on Segways. And, that's not how it played out. So I push those as cautionary tales. And, I guess that's my big question of whether, you're going to see a lot of the eVTOL stuff end up as aeronautical Segways.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What advice would give to our listeners are starting companies with all of your experience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Agree that it is a remarkable time for innovation and thus for entrepreneurship answer in aerospace I encourage and support that.

I believe that the goal here is to build sustainable, viable businesses. That means they have to have customers and revenue and ultimately earnings. And, I think that's what you've really got to focus on when you build a business is, how am I going to get to, revenues and earnings and not, just, some kind of paper valuation.
