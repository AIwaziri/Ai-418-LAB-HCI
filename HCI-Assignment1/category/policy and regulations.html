For those of you who've been listening to many of our last several podcasts discussions, especially those with Rob Britton and Jeff Luckett, you'll find our discussion with Kevin a perfect follow on. After discussing areas where some may disagree with Kevin, we launch into an overview of electric aviation. And the industry that blossomed due to its introduction. Kevin also discusses that the electric-only industry hasn't seen the battery progress that many had hoped, which has pushed back the timelines of many fully dedicated electric vehicles. We also discuss how electric only vehicles especially eVTOL have more limited near term use cases. We then talk about hybrid propulsion versus electric propulsion. We discuss what parts of hybrid propulsion are changing the fastest today, and it's different and unique use cases. We then discuss why an operator in regional air mobility would select an electric vehicle versus what some would consider the more obvious choice of hybrid electric propulsion. We delve a bit deeper into regional air mobility and how overall electrification may increase the use of regional air mobility. We discuss the pluses and minuses of pure electrification hybrid and traditional aircraft on regional air mobility as well. Kevin wraps up our discussion with some great advice for our innovators and entrepreneurs. Kevin, thanks for joining us for a terrific discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Kevin Noertker, as you profitably innovate in The Vertical Space. Kevin Noertker is co-founder and CEO of Ampaire. Over the past eight years, Kevin and his team have pioneered practical, compelling electrified flight through the upgrade of existing aircraft types. In 2019, they flew the world's largest hybrid electric aircraft. In 2020 and 2021 they deployed and demonstrated electrified flight with multiple airlines across the globe. With over 23,000 miles flown hybrid and 12 plus regulatory flight approvals across three countries to date, they're a leader in hybrid electric aviation. Prior to Ampaire, Kevin contributed engineering and program management expertise to advanced aircraft and satellite technology development programs at Northrop Grumman and as a research fellow at Caltech and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An entrepreneur at heart, Kevin is driven to apply the science and engineering disciplines of large aerospace organizations to pressing environmental problems here on Earth.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, Kevin, welcome.

The first is, we're in sustainable aviation and there's a lot of talk about new design planes and new markets, eVTOL and, high speed new design jets. And first is, I believe that we need to start with propulsion rather than airframe design. And there's a whole lot of good that you can do with new airframe designs, but novel propulsion is how we've seen these transformative moments progress in the past, whether that's the dawn of powered flight or the jet age. And I think you need to get the propulsion right before you start doing the transformative vehicle designs. There'll be a lot of people out there that might disagree with me on that one. Number two is that,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, I'll just, if I could jump in. I had a very senior transportation leader call me last week and say exactly\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>that's great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After listening to so many of our podcasts, he called me up and said, I want to talk about propulsion. And then I, as we were preparing for this, I was thinking, Oh, wow, this is perfect timing. So at least there's one person out there who agrees\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I appreciate that. Well, he and I should grab coffee sometime. I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp>great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And to add this strikes me as perhaps more commonly held view than perhaps you are alluding to. All the new technology waves in aviation revolve around or are enabled by new propulsion. So what is it about this particular statement that, the industry disagrees with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's the idea that you need to do the new airframe design with the new propulsion in the first embodiment. Ampaire over the years has gotten a lot of pushback from industry stakeholders about doing upgrades of existing aircraft types. But you can't capture the full opportunity, they say, by upgrading an existing plane, you really need distributed electric propulsion, or you need the new airflow augmentation, or your vertical lift features, and that they believe that those features are going to drive the adoption dynamic, and that propulsion retrofits which is the path Ampaire has taken, is not a sufficient starting place. I think that's where the differentiation comes in. Because certainly eVTOL, let's take as an example, requires novel propulsion. what I'm saying is we can decouple those as a first step. Not to belittle the benefits that you would get from a clean sheet design, or maybe it's ultra short takeoff and landing performance. But the fact that designing a plane around propulsion that is not yet certified, that does not yet exist, is a recipe for having to redesign that plane half a dozen times. And we've already seen people burn a lot of capital going through that path this turn of the wheel. But if you just look in history, I mean, this is new design planes that didn't do it around existing propulsion. That's one of the big gotchas in the, in the design space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And there was another thing that you wanted to flag.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This is going one layer down there for propulsion. Hybrid electric is the only approach that makes sense right now. There are many exciting technologies. Obviously, fully electric is a dream many of us have. There's some corner cases where fully electric might work. There are a lot of people pushing hydrogen, but the reality is just like on the ground. Hybrid electric is going to lead, it is the gateway technology to this future. And I think it's going to be the gateway technology for decades.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I didn't expect a different answer from you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'm talking about, anything with commercial relevance, where operating flexibility, that is range, payload, airports that you can fly to and from, anywhere in the economics, anywhere that matters, and you need to get to scale, hybrid electric is what'll get you there.

And, and hybrid doesn't place any uncontrollable bets.

Why is it that the industry doesn't think that hybrid is the way to go?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think back to when we founded Ampaire. And I think back to a lot of the people in this industry who have such deep passion for making a positive impact on the world around us. And those core motivations for many are about usually one of two things. Either they care deeply about the environment and they want a true zero emissions solution. And that forces their designs into a fully electric or, a strong hybrid where you're flying fully electric for some period of time, or a hydrogen where they can claim a, zero carbon emissions in flight, if it's a fuel cell. And so what you see is this desire to have a pure carbon, remedy. And that causes people to not prefer the hybrid electric type approaches or these hybrid approaches where, you know, 50 percent fuel savings, 50 to 70 percent in our vehicles is phenomenal, but it's not zero. And if you're here on only principle and unwilling to look at anything but the pure solution, then that would bias you against it. The second is, there are some people who are pushing toward this idea of you have to start with the absolute simplest, simplest possible architecture, even if it's not possible today. And electric is phenomenally simple. And the maintenance costs are super low, and in theory you can get the economics to play out, depending on your battery assumptions. And if you believe, if you have certain optimisms in that area, then you don't want to give yourself the complexity or the crutch of having to do the partial via hybrid solution. And I think that keeps some people away from it because they say, oh, batteries will get there. Like, let's just wait around for those. But I think they miss the point that if you can serve, 10 times the market size by using hybrid electric, and you're saving half the fuel burn on that. That's, do the math, it's five times the positive impact of a few or zero emissions on that one tenth of a market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Let's talk about electric aviation. Zoom out a little bit, catch us up on some of the major milestones in electric aviation over the last several years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, electric aviation has had some pretty amazing progress in the last decade or so. The earliest companies in this industry were founded in the, 2010s but very few were talking about them at that point in time. You had the starting of, the NASA X 57 program. By the time Ampaire was founded in 2016, there still really weren't that many companies that were publicly acknowledged doing work in this space. Since then, we've seen this, this, blossoming of ideas, of concepts, I remember, the first time, I think, Peter, you were, you might have even been there at the, Uber Elevate Conference out in Dallas in 2017. There's this industry that built up around the enthusiasm for electrification. And then you saw hundreds, I believe the number peaked at over 700 different projects in this space. A lot of ideas, a lot of people who really get excited about designing airplanes. And, want to go through the features. So, big milestones. You've had first flights, whether those are the flights of the Pipistrel Alpha Electro, or ultimately that being delivered to customers around the world. You have the first flights of various development program aircraft, Ampaire's first flight in 2019, and, subsequent iterations, for example, our, Caravan flight in, 2022. The industry's also made progress from, simple demonstration of flight capability to very specific capabilities. So in eVTOL, the progress of transitioning from vertical lift to fixed wing flight has been a, a big challenge where still only a handful of companies have safely made that transition or done so with a pilot on board. These are critical milestones that will drive confidence in adoption and ability to gain regulatory approvals on the, on the operations. You've seen some incremental progress along the battery energy density. standpoint, so a lot of folks are waiting for batteries to have significantly higher watt hours per kilogram, so the gravimetric energy density in the lithium ion batteries in particular. And we've seen some modest progress on that and some really amazing announcements. Some groups who are in the chemistry side trying to, get up toward, past 500 watt hours per kilogram, targeting 1, 000 watt hours per kilogram, pretty audacious goals. I think, the industry hasn't yet seen, as significant of progress as many had hoped, and that's, that's pushing back timelines for entry into service of the fully electric, fully electric vehicles. And then from a certification standpoint, some pretty big milestones. Back to 2018, where we were kicking off a ASTM committee around electric vehicle chargers, through all the SAE committees or other industry groups working together on certification. While these might not be the visible milestones that hit the press, there's certainly the milestones and progress that help move the industry forward. And so, watching folks get their first certification bases established, or get a, get means of compliance agreed upon, or special conditions, moving forward, ultimately looking, I think here in the next few years, we'll get the first full, regulatory approvals for commercial operation. And, and each of those are some of the very meaningful milestones that are, happening real time and coming up soon.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the surprises for me was, the lack of certification events following Pipistrel's EASA certification of their, Velis Electro aircraft in the LSA category that was back in the summer of 2020. And then earlier this year, I think in March, the FAA issued an LSA airworthiness exemption for that same aircraft. But here we are four years later and no other electric aircraft has been certified. Why do you think that's the case? What's the bottleneck? about the.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think the, there are a few things. One is, the regulatory basis for certification. And the Pipistrel products didn't fully open up the Part 23 or the vertical lift, certification arena. it was in a different category initially. And I think that while it made progress and maybe others could have taken their products through that same, the, you know, the identical regulatory pathway, many of the products that are out there that we most were paying attention to are in Part 23 or the vertical lift category, which was not as fully opened up through the Pipistrel application. Think second was a bit of the dynamics in the market, so with the pandemic in 2020, I think a lot of milestones were dragged out a bit. 2021, money was easy, and I think that meant that money went to moonshots. So easy money doesn't mean it goes to practical, near term, near term wins. And so I think that a lot of the money that was being invested in late 2020 and throughout 2021 was going toward long horizon plays. So purposefully not aiming at super near term strategies. And I think that overfunded those, and we've seen many get significant funding, but then burning through it, and I think it underfunded the pragmatic strategies. and so what you saw was further pressures on or delays to the timelines for entry into service for those that might not have been as flashy, but were, were just making the, the next increment of meaningful progress. And then we've seen the retrenchment of the markets where now there's a bit of a recoil. I think, the industry's at risk of losing credibility. Given all the claims that were made and failed to be lived up to, whether that's certain timelines, or product performance, or cost metrics for the products. And so, I think the industry, in particular the capital allocators, may be licking their wounds from those moonshot projects that didn't play out, which doesn't help again those that are near term. What it does is it pulls back more capital away from everything, and so if you're looking at that as a lowering tide, each of these dynamics I think is has pressed away from certification milestones that we might have otherwise hoped to see more rapidly after the Pipistrel's early successes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what about the maturity of the enabling technologies themselves and the certifiability of the motors and batteries. What's the status there? And I was recently catching up with another founder and we started talking about this and it was surprising to hear how the regulatory bodies are trying to apply traditional propulsion system requirements to electric motors. So for instance, I think there's a requirement somewhere in internal combustion engines that they need to be able to run for, I think it's five minutes in max rated power, whereas an electric motor reaches its thermal limit, a lot quicker, maybe within, two minutes or so before needing to throttle back. And so that is one contentious issue, allegedly as is the example of having dual magnetos in ICE engines, and does that translate into, you know, double architecture in electric motors, all of that increasing mass, increasing budget, and really not making that cost equation as favorable as initially expected. Do you have any insights into those aspects of how the bottlenecks are being tackled at the certifiability and the maturity of the technologies?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think that this gets to one of the really critical and core risks in the industry, which is the supply chain and the ability to not just invent something, but to produce it reliably many times at a good economics. That's really what builds the markets here. I think the regulatory bodies are trying to adapt to what they know. And, those adaptations, whether it's the Part 23 rewrite, which adapted combustion type expectations to, an opener, larger net for what kind of technologies could actually be used to meet those requirements. But in the details, they're still looking for that familiarity. So what's your mean time between failure? How long can you run at full power? What are the failure modes and effects, and making sure that you're going through the detail on that? This is the, the specifics that you get into when putting together your program certification plan, your means of compliance, or ultimately going through the testing for your, Type Certificate or STC, and it is, it's really where the rubber hits the road in the industry. I don't think that all the answers are there yet. I think there are the early entrance, certainly Ampaire is, at least to our knowledge, the only company working on a hybrid electric propulsion system certification program actively with the FAA. And so this means that we are, we're clearing many of those open questions actively with them and collaboratively with them. It also means that we have, expectations upon our supply chain that, emerge over time if something, for example, with the FAA, brings up or highlights a requirement that we did not expect. As you talked about with the motors. for these questions about redundancy, there's what you could expect as a technologist, like you'd understand the technology and you believe this to be true, some level of safety, let's say, but that does not mean that will be accepted on the first pass through certification. And in fact, I think that the first paths through certification are going to be relatively risk averse and risk managed in those setting a higher bar for redundancy, not giving you credit for levels of safety that you think you might deserve. So, case in point, for the lithium ion batteries, no matter what you do to the cells, no matter how you package those cells into your modules, no matter what physical, interconnect or disconnect controls you have that might mitigate thermal runaway, or physical barriers that might mitigate propagation or software layers that are on top of all of that. The belts and suspenders and layers of safety. At the end of the day, the FAA, probably rightly so at this stage, requires you to show that you have physical barriers that if you force the battery into thermal runaway, the vehicle will be safe. So you don't get, you don't get actual credit for everything below that. You need ultimate safety and then all the other stuff that you thought was going to be sufficient. And these are, again, I don't think it should be surprising to anybody that the earliest, earliest applications, we're going to take a, the most risk managed approach. But what it means is that when you're a battery engineer on your fully electric vehicle, you're now doubling the weight of all these additional systems when you thought you could get there just with a really good BMS algorithm. And so what it drives is the decisions and it drives the, ultimately the designs into corners that might not be viable given some of those early assumptions. This is why we pushed again toward hybrid electric, because with a battery pack, a third the size of a Tesla pack and able to take on the extra weight and the payload hit along with it for all these physical layers of safety, we still have phenomenal performance on our system. and I think that these are, these are areas where the industry is trying to navigate alongside the regulations to mature, the solutions and the risk, together.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, what electric aircraft are selling in meaningful numbers today that you're impressed by?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you say stelling, I'm gonna assume you mean where there's a cash transaction and somebody ends up with an airplane. in their hangar at the end of it, and right now the only airplanes that are selling, are the Pipistrel aircraft at this time. There are many organizations placing orders, pre orders for, eventual deliveries, but at this stage, very minimal on the actual sales in this market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Kevin, what are you seeing as the FAA's thought process for how industry is going to incorporate improvements in hybrid electric propulsion systems into these aircraft in the coming years. These aircraft are long lived assets. Batteries still seem to be improving pretty markedly over the years. Motor technology as well. So if you certify something, on the one hand, you're locked in at that point in time, are they going to use an STC method for bringing improvements in? Or is there something that is even more fluid for allowing that, that they have in mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's a really good point because the technology base is moving so much faster than the time scale of a vehicle life, right? These aircraft last 40 years. And the, batteries are improving on the, on the order of every two to three years, you'd expect people wanting an upgrade of their battery pack to the next generation, a little bit like people might want their new iPhone every few years. The way you go about certifying your product matters. And if you wrap everything into the type certificate, then you need to amend or update the type certificate when anything changes. And so that would require a supplemental type certificate for certain types of changes. Generally, propulsion systems, propellers, or airframe changes require a new type certificate, or a amendment, or a STC, supplemental type certificate. There are things you can change on an airplane without having to go get an STC. You could replace a conforming part with an equivalent part. You're able to show certain equivalent levels of safety. And so there are efforts to try to find ways that these components which would be replaced over time, let's use the batteries as an example. Batteries degrade over the cycles of use, and every few years you want to replace those. You have to go get an STC for the new battery pack are you able to use a TSO type of process? Basically a lighter version of those approvals. And it really depends on exactly how that battery pack was incorporated into the vehicle level certification. So is it part of the engine? Is it part of the aircraft? Is it a safety of flight critical component? And then as technology improves, One of the things in aviation is you lock yourself into the parts that you designed and that an in any change in that part requires a change in your regulatory approval. So as batteries improve, how do you go through that certification pathway? Again, generally, what I think the industry will see is we guarantee equivalent performance while providing improved performance. And that all you're doing when you're meeting the existing regulatory waterline is you're saying we're at least as good as we were previously, and we haven't changed any flight characteristics. The question will be, when do you want to take credit for that? When do you want to allow the operator to plan a longer route? You can give them more energy, which gives them more safety, or maybe it gives them more flexibility on how many, how many flight miles they can perform or when they need to recharge at the other end. But it might not be part of the underlying. certification, performance capability of the vehicle that you've, that you've sought from the regulatory body. Now, this is a nuance, but it's the difference between having to go through the full cert program for the new tech or just increasing performance but taking credit for an equivalent level of safety. One specific point here, in our hybrid system, I have triplicate redundancy in our hybrids. We are phenomenally safe, and I believe safer than a traditional combustion engine would be, where it's a single point failure for the traditional engine. And in our, in Ampaire's system, we have redundancy, two layers of redundancy in the combustion engine. And then also this independent electric system, which is able to carry you further as well. But am I going to get credit for anything more than a single engine capability? Probably not. and that's understandable, at least initially. And I think over time, what people, what you'll get is additional credit for those things from the regulatory body. And in the interim, when new tech, motors, or batteries come out, It'll be at equivalent levels of safety as what was there previously.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What components of the hybrid electric propulsion system are changing the fastest right now, be it the battery systems, the motors themselves, power electronics, or something else? What do you see as the fastest changing or evolving?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, the fastest changing components historically have been those which had the benefit of riding the coattails of other industries. Aviation, as big as we love it and believe it is, is much smaller than, as a market driver, than other forms of ground transportation. And so we have been the recipients of rapid technology improvement across lithium ion batteries as energy density, volume density and cost get brought down. The, the motors have been a, truly the underlying enabling factor in many of these cases. So the power density of motors is pretty phenomenal compared to where it was a decade ago. And we still see companies that are, and we work closely with companies that are pioneering in this space. And you can start, you're getting great efficiencies and really high, power density out of these motors. Where, certainly Ampaire has locked most of the components for our launch product, but we have a flying testbed where we're able to bring in new technologies, where we first flew a silicon carbide inverter, when we have brought in new motors, inverters, and energy storage tech. And it's really in those, the motors and batteries that most people are pushing firmly for innovation, and then a bit in the efficiency of the power electronics, but a lot of that currently is, seems like it's lab scale technology. And while our work with ARPA E and NASA enables us to make that move even faster, I hesitate to, to think that lab technology today is going to rapidly enter commercialization anytime soon. I think we've seen a consistent trend that timelines for those developments take much longer than, than the, the technology teams would, would have originally anticipated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is aviation going to continue to benefit from advances in the automotive industry around the batteries that they use? Or is there going to be a fork in the road where the needs of aviation diverge from what the auto industry is pushing towards?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, the auto industry used to have range anxiety. But then battery energy density got to the point that you can drive hundreds of miles. There's a sufficient charging network. So I don't see the energy density being what automotive is optimizing for anymore. Really, I think automotive is going to continue optimizing for cost, and we've seen that over the last few years. Bringing the cost of an EV down is the driver for adoption more than bringing the range up. Whereas in aviation, we're still in that bringing the range up is the requirement. And so this is a divergence in the optimization goals for the technology coming out of automotive. Now the question would be, even if the goals are different, is the state of the art, the state of knowledge and capability, is that going to improve? As folks go toward lower cost, are we going to also see emergent benefits for aviation? Absolutely. As people do innovation and build new types of electric machines, it's no longer just about what is Tesla using in a Roadster, it's about where the larger vehicles, your mid duty and heavy duty trucks, what are the power requirements for those vehicles. What are the energy densities required for those? And so it's this expanding fringe of requirements that I think will also drive a, an alignment in, in, in emerging technologies with what aviation is looking for. But the core of a ground car is, is less likely to directly align with aviation than it did over the last decade in my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Are the batteries that you would design around for your hybrid electric conventional takeoff and landing airplane, are they the same ones that you would design around for a VTOL aircraft? And the reason I ask is that, an additional difference that I've, come to appreciate with batteries for VTOL aircraft is the power output demand on them, especially requiring high power output at the end of the flight as the aircraft transitions back into vertical flight to make its approach at the landing pad. That's a particularly, stringent requirement on the battery system. For what you're doing, I don't know, maybe that still exists. Maybe it's the same battery. Maybe you, you can, use the same tech, but how do you think about that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a nuance that most of the world, unlike you, Peter, most of the world doesn't catch the nuance between the different types of batteries. The power density versus the energy density needs to be tailored for the application. And what's interesting is you gave two examples. I'll add one more in there around fully electric airplanes. So let's take your eVTOL, which is fully electric, but requires huge amounts of power at a low state of charge at the end of flight, right? So you need a power cell there. Then you have a fully electric airplane, which has a large amount of batteries. And so actually a relatively low C rate, especially if it's conventional takeoff and landing. You're not really draining where, for those listening, the C rate is the rate of charge or discharge. as a proportion of the total pack size. And so that, when you have a really large pack, relative to your pack size, you're not discharging that rapidly. And so those can be energy cells, because you don't really need that high power C rate. But then you go to a hybrid electric plane. And as I mentioned, our pack is about a third the size of a Tesla pack. These are pretty small, actually. When you come through our hangar, you see this battery is big enough to fly a Caravan, really. And that is because in a hybrid, you use the battery differently than you would in the fully electric. A small battery pack, but you still have pretty high power for takeoff and climb. Again, now you need a higher C rate. You need more of a power cell. And so for each application, you do actually have different requirements for the type of the type of chemistry you might consider, the, tailoring of that cell between energy and power, certainly the life cycle economics of the pack, the degradation over time, you might have great power or great energy, but if you only cycle 400 times, then are you useful? There's a, there's, there are all these pieces that go into the details of selecting a battery. And this is the challenge that some companies who are trying to do a one size fits all, cell or module for everybody, need to hit the high waterline or miss the, miss the mark on their, their certain markets. And this is again, why I think it's so important to have a more flexible design where let's say that I need to increase the size of my pack a little bit because I'm not getting exactly what I wanted out of my supply chain, where we can handle that. it's not ideal. We don't desire it, but when you have a, an approach, which is just a little bit more flexible than, the pure heart requirement, I think most eVTOL folks. A lot of the ones who have decided to in house their battery development is because they realize they will not get precisely what they need from anyone else, and they have to tailor it directly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Given the advantages of the hybrid propulsion to electric, why would the eVTOL or the electric plane companies go purely electric versus hybrid? What would be some of their rationale?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Number one is, that I hear from them is on the emissions. They want to be able to say they can operate fully zero emissions. Number two is a statement around, around complexity, the economics of maintenance and that's a, it's an interesting argument which, without being deep into the weeds, it's hard to validate or, dispute. All the weeds that I've been in have shown that fully electric still has a way to go before it's economically more viable. But those are usually why I see, that it can, there are other ancillary features, like, for example, noise characteristics are important for communities. Oftentimes the reason communities get upset with aviation is because of the noise. And hybrid electric does not fully eliminate the noise profile, to the extent that full, that fully electric does. Fully electric planes, if you've ever flown in one, it's like being in a glider a lot of the time. It's really beautiful. and I think that some people have hung their hats on the sound, and frankly, to their credit, if you're an eVTOL talking about flying to the city center of Manhattan, you better be thinking about sound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's not how people are going to scale in the next several years. At the end of the day, regional air mobility most likely is how a vehicle is going to scale in the next, let's face it, 5 to 10 years. And given regional air mobility, given the requirements of the vehicles, I'm guessing that hybrid is going to be the, the limitations of hybrid are not nearly as impactful as they would be if they go into city center. And how many city center flights are going to be occurring in the next five to ten years, and especially at scale. So my guess is a lot of people right now listening are saying, hybrid's the way to go. Why would they not be saying that, especially as we start to talk about regional air mobility?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so it depends on who they are. Let's say that you are an eVTOL developer. We know many. And you've spent the last half a decade, investing how many hundreds of millions of dollars into your pure electric design. That is tailored, that every inch of it is optimized specifically for your fully electric operation. You don't have volume, you don't have weight, you would have to redesign your plane in order to integrate a hybrid electric system. And I know this because I've worked with those groups, and we have shown that you can apply a hybrid electric system in. But shoehorning a hybrid into a combustion plane is one thing, that's where we enter the market. Shoehorning a hybrid into something which was designed for a little battery pack, is a completely different beast. And I think a lot of these developers have gotten so deep into their fully electric application that they don't have the payload and volume capacity to take on the hybrid electric into their current designs. And so,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But let's move on. Let's say, Kevin, sorry, great answer, but let's talk about the operators who are going to be purchasing these vehicles. Why would they consider a fully, let's again, let's step into regional air mobility. Why would they consider a fully electric plane with its, with some of its limitations? Obviously some pluses, but the hybrid I would assume is still less noisy, for example, than a traditional combustion engine. Why would they consider a fully electric plane rather than a hybrid for regional air mobility in the next 5 to 10 years? What's their rationale? Put yourself in the position of an operator who has to make that decision.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so I would ask, what's the risk? Am I, what, truly, what's the risk? The risk that I put down an order? Even if it's binding, I'm sure there are tons of outs that if it, if this doesn't meet my performance requirements, I don't have to buy it. And probably if I'm putting money down, it's going into an escrow that it can come back to me. Most aren't putting money down for the fully electric, type orders that are out there. And so I would look at it and say, I could place an order for a fully electric plane and if it doesn't pan out, great. If all of the Swiss cheese of good things going right doesn't occur, I probably got a boost to my marketing and brand along the way, and I'm not out any money at the end of the day, I could probably still buy a hybrid down the road. Now, the reality is a lot of these groups are falling behind in our order books, so, potentially they won't be as, as, as early as they would like, but if magic happens and the performance is what people would love electric to be, then I get the electric plane and everything that I needed. And so I think it's a risk posture that, the benefit of placing a signaling order outweighs the risk. And the key for me, as Kevin and with my Ampaire hat on, is those folks still place orders for hybrids. Right? Like, when I talk to folks, they're like, Kevin, this is the first thing that I actually have confidence is going to come to market. I'm going to place an order for this. And what's silly is some of those people still say, and by the way, we don't want to talk publicly about this because our brand is still like fully zero emissions, but we know that this is probably going to come in first. And so we'd like to take part in it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, in what way is certifying a hybrid configuration easier or more difficult compared to certifying a battery electric?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the hybrid, one of the reasons it's easier is the safety case. The safety case for our system in the, condition where you assume you have an issue with the electric vehicle system, which is really what is the novel, parts of the technology. If you're in a hybrid electric condition like ours, you fall back onto a combustion engine and you fly home safely. We have full cruise capacity. With our combustion engine, so there's no degradation or risk to that operation if you shut off the electric system in flight. You can't say that for a fully electric, or hydrogen, for example, system that, when you have an issue, maybe you have redundancy in the battery packs, but the level of safety that you can, that you can, take credit for in the hybrid is quite a bit higher. And, and certifying that is, is we believe going to be faster and lower complexity and lower cost than going fully electric. The second is around the size and, requirements on each of the subcomponents. So whether it's the batteries or the motors, when you look at the reduced consequence of an issue, you can also, take different or take a different balance on the, the probability of certain issues occurring. And, and so the holistic risk analysis for the, the safety case, we have a little bit more flexibility. And that means that flexibility translates into the supply chain and our ability to move a bit more quickly and getting those, getting those technologies through the certification program.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the expected efficiency gain of a hybrid electric conventional aircraft versus the efficiency gain that we are seeing from hybrid electric automobiles? And is there a difference? And if so, why? And then we can get into efficiency gain that you would see from just like retrofitting an existing airplane versus designing an airplane around hybrid electric. Especially for the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft because going to electric propulsion when you want to do distributed electric propulsion for vertical flight or for electric STOL, okay, we get that, right? There's a capability there that's earning its way onto the aircraft. But if you are going for conventional takeoff and landing, and you are looking for an efficiency gain, what can we expect to see?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the efficiency of these hybrid systems, and I, I see hybrid as this gateway technology that as the underlying technology improves directionally toward fully electric, all of it will first get proven out in these hybrid electric systems, conditions. One of the, one of the great drivers for adoption of hybrid electric is the fuel efficiency of the systems that, that we and have already demonstrated and have been flying tens of thousands of miles so far in our hybrid systems and demonstrated a 50% fuel burn reduction. During takeoff and climb cycle, we're up closer to 70 percent fuel burn reduction. So these are actual measurements, right? This is not just an Excel spreadsheet model. This is empirical data and is the kind of benefit that you can get in certain embodiments of hybrid electric systems. So this is, pretty, pretty significant fuel savings, even when you're looking at the, the opportunity of hybrid-electric on the ground, where, call it maybe a 40 percent fuel savings, to 50 percent fuel savings on the ground. And it's all about the specific architecture of the system that drives the beneficial economics. Fuel is one of the largest, if not the largest, operating cost for most airlines. And so the fuel burn reduction then drives a positive cycle for the economic viability of new routes and market growth and higher frequencies of service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What phase of flight are these efficiencies realized the most?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, if you're just looking at a pure percentage basis of fuel savings, takeoff and climb is where you're getting the biggest boost from the electric system in our current architecture. There are lots of different hybrid architectures, and we've got a few of them, but what we're launching into product, into market with is a integrated parallel hybrid architecture where we use the electric system effectively as a boost during the high power phases of flight and the combustion engine as a baseline load of power for the cruise and, and across the rest of the flight. So you get up to 70 percent fuel savings, during that takeoff and climb cycle. And then it levels off toward about 50 percent fuel savings during the cruise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I see. What's the state of the art in some of the metrics on the battery side? We talked a little bit about, well, we didn't talk numbers, but gravimetric specific energy density, both at the cell and the pack level, the cycle life that state of the art batteries are achieving, and the, battery pack cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the, the batteries, so watt hours per kilogram is the metric that we in the industry normally uses to measure the energy density. The target most are aiming for is right around 400 watt hours per kilogram at a pack level. We're not close to that today. When you're looking at the packs today, you're at, right around 200 watt hours per kilogram really depends on your cooling system and where you draw the dotted line on the battery pack itself and what you include as weight versus don't include as kind of wet versus dry weight for the pack. The cells themselves, are, I remember a few years ago seeing cells that were cresting through the 200s of watt hours per kilogram, and then you get folks who are talking about 300, even into the 400 watt hour per kilogram cells. I think I've seen announcements about cells that are even significantly higher than that. Unfortunately, I'm not an expert in the kind of the lab type chemistry that goes into these batteries and the art of understanding where along the long tail of getting from lab into production you are and in measuring the number of years remaining is very challenging. And so it's hard to tell what, like, state of the art for, for the development of new technologies sounds like it's pretty far ahead in these high watt hours per kilogram. I think the reality is the first battery packs that get adopted into market are going to be at a pack level, maybe even sub 200 watt hours per kilogram, when you're looking full scope, full scope weight of the system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And in terms of cycle life and cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Cycle life and cost are, generally tailored depending on what your application are. So if you've got a more exotic cell, a higher power or energy density, it'll probably have a lower cycle life. I've heard some of our industry peers talking about cycle lives less than a thousand cycles. I don't see how that makes a whole lot of economic sense when you have to be replacing the batteries so, so repeatedly. We think that a 2, 000 to 3, 000 cycles, maybe it's 2, 000 full depth discharge, but you're looking at, you know, that might give you 4, 000 or 5, 000 actual flight cycles on a, on a vehicle, that's not unrealistic when you're not working with the most exotic type cells. And from a cost, I think, we're pretty conservative assuming costs are going to be pretty, pretty high, and it's hard to tell what'll come out in full production once you actually get to scale, but being at$500 per kilowatt hour, I think would be a great outcome for the industry if we were able to get there. And, I wouldn't be surprised if the very first battery packs that came to market were quite a, maybe a multiple higher than that. So maybe a thousand dollars per kilowatt hour. Which gets pretty expensive, especially when you're looking at the very large packs for, for the fully electric vehicles, but is still somewhat manageable with the, with the hybrid electric approach.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to put some business perspective into the conversation and if we use, uh, maybe we can get to ultimately the use case that you are pursuing at Ampaire, but one of the common near term use cases for electric aircraft is often thought of on the conventional side as a flight school trainer aircraft. Now, putting aside that the current range restrictions do not enable flight schools to use electric aircraft for the entirety of the curriculum for flight training, but for most, missions, it's good enough. What I'm interested in is when you actually go down into the weeds that you've been in, how the business case for an electric, fully battery powered aircraft pencils out when you consider the fact that, conventional piston engines are an industry that's been around for decades, benefiting from huge economies of scale, exceptional safety records, it's in the several thousands annual units, a lot of the development and R&amp; D costs have been recovered already. I mean, you're going after a relatively low cost. And I think the engine, replacement on, in this type application is in the 30, 40, 50. maybe 70, 000 per engine, correct me guys, uh, if I'm off. Uh, but at any rate, uh, you have that on the one hand, and then you have an electric, aircraft with a motor that, needs to recover the certification costs and development costs, and is one that every, you know, thousand cycles needs to replace the battery, which can be, I don't know, 80, 000 or whatever the cost is. So when you bake all of these different things, does it really become an attractive option?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So this gets back to your first question around what might the industry disagree with me on, and it is this principle that the economics must make sense in order for people to adopt the products. There are a lot of people out there who assume government subsidies will get us there, or people willing to pay a green premium. And while certain cases that might be true, to hit the scale of adoption that's required, you can't achieve it without really compelling economic benefits for the end user and buyer. So this example that you gave around the, the training, especially in these smaller airplanes, is a great one. The market makes so much sense. The direct operating cost seems so low when you're only taking into account the industrial power that you're using. It's cents on the dollar for OpEx. But when you look whole scale and you're comparing yourself against a, sub 100, 000 airplane with relatively low cost of capital, it's probably fully depreciated, and you're comparing that to a quarter million dollar new build plane that has these unknowns around the cost of batteries over time, or the cost of the infrastructure to charge. The economics are really called into question, especially before you get to full scale. And I think that's, rightly should be acknowledged as one of the big risks for adoption. The performance of the systems, especially in training, I think a blended fleet where, cross country flights might have to be in a hybrid or combustion, but fully electric can be done for the, a few touch and goes here or there, or just familiarization. That's, I think that's completely reasonable to solve the problem. But the economics, especially in smaller airplanes, are pretty challenging. When you look at the economics as you scale to larger planes, it similarly, anywhere that it's not an operator of, high frequency becomes challenging because to earn back the capital cost of the system, you really need high utilization. And, you're not generally going against an option which is a premium priced combustion versus a premium priced electric. It's probably a relatively low cost combustion versus a premium priced electric, and I think that will be a friction point for adoption for those types of applications.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, if you were to argue for a fully battery electric aircraft, what is the right initial use case that will generate this flywheel moment where it makes sense and it also is a good path to get to scale, which will have benefits down the road with economies of scale and the supply chain, et cetera, et cetera. What use case gets the industry going, if not flight training.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think the use case that gets the electrification industry going is using those technologies in full scale applications. So it's taking the exact same batteries, the motors, the power electronics, These certification bases, taking those and by applying them into the hybrid electric applications, you build the industry base. You build the production volumes. You solve those economic challenges tied in with the supply chain and the certification and the market's readiness to adopt. Tying in with the economics of the full scope view, you start to bring those costs down to a point where all of a sudden those same technologies, those same suppliers that are making batteries for the hybrid or making motors for the hybrid, when the economics of scale get to a point, those same suppliers will be the supply base for the fully electric applications where, the opportunities are vast for, where you might want to fly a fully electric plane, whether it's short hop island hopping for commercial cargo flights, commercial drones, or for eVTOL cargo, or for pilot training. There are a lot of areas where you might want the fully electric. And I think the way to get the industry to scale is by scaling the underlying components rather than scaling the end solution of fully electric. And that's when I talk about hybrid as this gateway technology, I truly believe I'm helping all the electric, maybe even helping some hydrogen out there. Like because we're maturing the industry, we're maturing the supply base and we're getting up to good economics, full scale marketability of these underlying technologies that ultimately can be packaged in the fully electric. And that's I think that's how you get there. In eight and a half years of every waking and sleeping moment thinking about it, this is the pathway that makes sense to me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We just had Rob Britton on a couple weeks ago, our last podcast, and he was talking about regional air mobility, and he was saying that it's conceivable that hybrid or electric aircraft will allow us to be able to get to locations that today are less profitable than using a purely combustion engine aircraft. Talk a little bit about that. I'm guessing that hybrid would be the only solution today, although he did mention, I believe, guys, a 30 passenger electric plane as a potential solution in the near future. But talk about the capabilities for hybrid electric for regional air mobility. What's the near term, long term solution from your perspective, Kevin?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I really enjoyed listening to the episode with Rob and his enthusiasm for regional hybrid electric. You can hear it coming through in the conversation. Love it. And the folks over at Heart who you mentioned a few times, you know doing some really interesting work in trying to open up the regional space. Also in that episode, he had mentioned that this regional space is kind of eroded over the years. I mean, with deregulation and things having to compete just on the economics, economics really didn't make sense to serve a lot of secondary or tertiary markets. And so the service to those markets has gone away. And, that demand still exists, it's just being served by ground transportation, people jumping in their cars instead of flying. If you were able to give an economic alternative, lower cost of operation, being the key adoption driver, then people would potentially choose to fly those routes instead of drive those routes. And I think he was spot on with that and the enthusiasm around regional air mobility. Two areas that I would disagree with the approach, though. One is there's a phenomenal difference between a 19 passenger plane and a 20 passenger plane. While it might look almost the same, it is categorically different, in the literal sense of it, is a different category of airplane between Part 23 and Part 33. And the idea that somebody will open up regional air mobility with a Part 25 plane that is something over 20 passengers, I think, is faulty logic there. I don't think it's going to be, Part 25 is not going to be ready for hybrid electric, fully electric, any novel system for quite some time. Now, I want it to be there, and we're certainly helping the industry get there, and there are companies betting their, livelihood on it, but this is where I would disagree with the approach because we believe Part 23 is where it has to start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, explain for the audience the nuances of the differences.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So there are two major categories for conventional airplanes. One category, which is under Part 23 of the regulations, governs all planes up to 19 passengers or the equivalent weight. Part 25 governs all airplanes, 20 passengers and above. And so when regulations are updated in the industry, they're updated for one category or the other, eventually both. The smaller aircraft category, Part 23, is already positioned with all of the legislation and regulation in place to adopt novel propulsion technologies. The larger category is not in that state yet. It takes a decade of work to make a significant change to regulation in aviation. And I think we have years ahead of us before the large aircraft is ready to adopt novel propulsion technology from a regulatory standpoint. The technology might be there, but I think the regulations are going to lag in that case. So entering market with Part 23, or airplanes that are up to 19 passengers, I think is the fastest way, and frankly the only way we will see commercial adoption this decade. And that maybe in the next decade we'll see, through the proof points of these Part 23 smaller airplanes, we will see that technology leapfrog up into and enable the conversion of those certifications requirements in the larger Part 25 airplanes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Speaking of regional air mobility, wanted to get your thoughts on whether you think that electric aviation is what catalyzes regional air travel, or is there a, simply a thickness of the demand that's an issue that needs to be addressed somehow first. You know, we can take a brief look at history prior to the 1978 deregulation, point to point was the, airline network model, and regional travel was subsidized by the government mostly. Post deregulation, we saw the emergence of hub and spoke and a lot of regional routes were abandoned because they did not make economic sense anymore. So you can look at that to draw the conclusion that, well, actually the demand is there is just a matter of making that air travel economic. And so, that's an argument for the technology's role in disrupting, again, this, segment of the industry. If that's the case, well, first of all, do you think that's the case? And then second of all, do you think that electric aviation is the technology that will make economics appealing or you need to start layering additional things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I absolutely think, electrification is the pathway to making the economics make sense. And the improved economics drives this elasticity, this growth in the market. where we will see increased frequencies on the existing routes, decreased ticket costs as competition goes up on those, and increased accessibility or flights to fringe airports, either in a hub and spoke extension or a point to point model that, that allows more people to have access to air travel. I think adoption will also be driven by in similar economic driver but through cargo. I think the cargo market will be a rapid adopter of good economics and will be serving maybe even before the passengers choose to fly to these areas. Same day and next day delivery of packages is a growing expectation for our global economy and I think that what we'll see is as the economics improve the cargo operators, so, think your, your FedEx's, UPS's, DHL's, and similar around the world are going to be adopting these both to serve the high end communities who, want their Amazon packages in the next day, but also to open up these billion people markets that don't currently have access to the global economy efficiently, whether that's moving agricultural goods or other products, the economic drivers of increasing accessibility for them. So it's not just about U. S. states and cities. I do actually think on the global scale, these economics open up countries, entire regions of the world that are currently isolated from the global aviation ecosystem and economy. And when you look at that as a driver for scale, it's not about you know, 10 percent increase in the people who want to fly to Fresno. It's about a going from a market of zero to a market of again, hundreds of millions of people being served for the first time ever and what that drives. And so I wholeheartedly think that the economics of electrification is what gets us there. It is also on those principles that I think some of the exciting features aren't necessary to get us there. So vertical takeoff and landing, important in some areas, but probably not important for the vast majority. Fully electric and important and beneficial, but not useful if you can't land on that dirt strip in Kenya. Like, you have to have full flexibility, and this is part of the reason why I have such conviction around the regional air mobility being opened up through hybridization, where we don't have any of those infrastructure, range or operational limitations, but give that great economic benefit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Kevin, let's say we had a Part 23 aircraft and we wanted to be able to get more aircraft to cities that are not being well served today. And you're saying Part 23 was the way we'd have to do it today. What's the cost per available seat mile for a conventional aircraft, hybrid and electric? Assuming the three of them, could meet that capability today, what's the relative cost difference between the three?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the difference in CASM between conventional and hybrid, we're looking at really depends on, on exactly how you're operating the plane, right? So it's going to be a range. We're looking at a 20 to 40% savings on your cost per available seat mile. So think, again, depends on how you're flying the plane, going from a dollar per available seat mile down to, 70 cents or there's 60 some odd cents per available seat mile. that kind of a transition in certain cases. Electric's harder because right now when I run the numbers, depends on how you assume battery costs, because batteries are the big replacement cost there, but the, right now it does not in my mind, close economically to go fully electric. Also, it's hard to do the analysis because most of the routes you can't even operate. And then the question comes in on, do I count the grid infrastructure upgrade costs and capex and costs of that capital over time in the analysis, or do I not? So it gets a bit muddy. I don't have numbers specifically on the electric in isolation, for those reasons.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you talked to airlines, who today say those routes are not profitable because of the traditional aircraft? Have you talked to them about your operating costs? Are they saying, if you can get me a 30 to 35 percent reduction, that's a route that becomes profitable?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Yeah, the numbers I just talked about are from a very specific model with a very specific airline that I can't mention the names of, but yes, we get into the weeds with our customers and look at their actual operations, their actual frequencies, and how they actually fly the planes. And look at holistic costs, because it's not just about how many miles or hours you fly, it's about pilot costs, it's about outstation staffing, it's about infrastructure upgrades, and if you're serious about this, you need to look holistically at every, down to what is the interest rate on the loan that you take out in order to, or the financing that you get in order to buy the system in the first place. Like there are, all the holistic view on the economics, and making sure that is, economically positive for our customers is how we get through it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I really want to underline the holistic approach because I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. There's a lot of enthusiasm about quoting direct operating cost reductions with electrification, but if you look at it in the context of regional air mobility, where you're really competing with cars and rail and when you are accepting the fact that electric motors are not in their prime time to address this need today, and you start talking about, okay, well, what really do customers care about other than price? They care about frequency and the reliability of the schedule. And that means that you have to be able to, honor a, a service that will be available in all kinds of weather or most weather. So now you start talking about IFR capability and now you start introducing IFR reserves on top of an already small range budget. And it's only when you look at things holistically like that, do you really get a clear perspective on, okay, how really competitive is electric aviation in this particular use case today or over the next couple of years. And I think that, you know, there needs to be a little bit more realism.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I agree, because I think that realism is going to be what builds credibility. It's what enables adoption, it's what enables all of these other factors, many of which we haven't even touched on, whether it's the insurance companies or the lessors, we have to worry about residual values. the holistic view is the only way you actually get a full ecosystem to buy in. And, I just recently had a deep dive with one of our major customers, on IFR, speed, and Flight into Known Icing conditions, because these are the realities of their operation. And we need to know, hey, if we choose to fly five knots faster or five knots slower, what are the repercussions? If we are, like, flying, like, guaranteeing IFR, or if we are, if, what happens if you're not flight into known icing conditions? You're hardly useful, because it's not just Alaska where you have to deal with icing, right? It's everywhere that you have to be confident in your aircraft's ability to operate. Otherwise these mission critical operations have to ground the plane. And if you ground a plane in one of these operations, it destroys a whole network. It has a residual ripple effect through the operations, until recovered. So, so it's important to have these capabilities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So here's a thought, Kevin. What if after all is said and done, the, 30, 40, 50 percent improvement really becomes something more like 10 percent? I'm talking hypothetically here, right? At what point does it make more sense to incrementally improve the efficiency of a turboprop or a conventional aircraft that is certified, well known, all of those things, and perhaps kickstart the electrification supply chain on the unmanned side of things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It makes a lot of sense to, to find wherever you can build the efficiencies into the operation. from the airframe design, there's some folks out there who, with traditional engines, are looking at cutting 30 to 50 percent of the fuel burn out of your 7 37 class planes by bringing, blended wing body type airplanes to market. So there, there are ways that you can, by creating a new aircraft, even if you're not changing propulsion, you can get some meaningful efficiency gains as well. At the end of the day, when you achieve fewer economic benefits, it reduces the addressable market for the technology. So, or inverting that, for every percent cost that I save, it opens up more and more market opportunities. So, there's a old story in the industry about a major airline that removed a few pages from their in flight brochure to save a few pounds because that mattered, right? And these are fractions of a percent saving. So in your example of saving 10%, still transformative. For many operations. Now, is it going to be as transformative as saving 40? Nowhere close. Will it still be meaningful? Only if it's economically compelling. And so this is where you look at the conversion. You know, so maybe somebody struggles to retrofit their plane, but if you're buying a brand new plane and you get to choose between, CapEx neutral across the two, the combustion or a hybrid, and that hybrid saves 10 percent on your OpEx, you might still go with the hybrid system because economically that still makes sense. So this could be a factor that delays adoption if the economics don't work out. From an unmanned standpoint, we're already seeing from a drones, eVTOL, or like a Department of Defense type applications some fully electric, uh, or places where the economics don't matter as much, where you know, they're willing to pay a premium for the mission capability. Those are certainly additional early adopter areas where I think, the industry is likely to get a boost, regardless of the fuel savings, a boost in market applicability because of the performance characteristics of these new vehicle types.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is the drone propulsion supply chain overlapping into the propulsion supply chain that you deal with?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, a year and a half ago, we acquired a company's assets, called, the company was named Talyn and Talyn was developing a, effectively a cargo lift drone, and various types of payloads that it could carry. Our propulsion systems fit straight into that cargo drone, straight into traditional, conventional takeoff and landing drones, or eVTOL, for a whole variety of applications. Ampaire's focus is, again, the disagreement place number one. Propulsion is where you begin, and I want to put propulsion across everything. And, yeah, so the same engine types, I mean, there are flavors and variations of engines, but, the major families are applicable across. across the industry, whether it's manned or unmanned.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, tell us a little bit about Ampaire. How do you make money today? How do you make money in five years and 10 years? What's your special sweet spot?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Ampaire is focused on the electrification of aviation, focused on propulsion, specifically hybrid electric propulsion, upgrading existing aircraft types as an entry point into market and using that as a gateway to transition the industry toward lower carbon and better economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Give examples of the type of aircraft that you're converting. I saw a Skymaster as\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>so back in 2019, we flew our very first aircraft type, which is a upgraded Cessna Skymaster push pull configuration. We call that an independent parallel hybrid architecture, where you have one combustion engine, one fully electric. We've also flown the Cessna Grand Caravan, which is with an integrated parallel hybrid architecture that uses a, mechanically coupled electric and combustion set of engines to be a hybrid electric aircraft. That same engine that goes into the Caravan is what we just finished our CDR on the King Air for integrating there. We've got the Twin Otter is a 19 passenger plane in the same category. And there are thousands of planes in market that use this category of engine. So this is our half megawatt class system. We also have a quarter megawatt class system, which is used as a, either a genset or propulsion system for general aviation, drones, and eVTOLs. Now, as a company where we're focused is around the certification of that launch product and the Caravan. The market that adopts that is both passenger carrying and cargo carrying for the commercial industry, but then also we've got a number of contracts with the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Energy. So our money today, our revenue, which is really just offsetting NRE costs, or non recurring engineering costs. We've brought in about 25 million of government contracts. For these, through these government customers, for the development of our propulsion system and the application of that system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're making$500 million in 5 years, who are your primary customers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we scale commercial revenue, this comes from the regional aviation market. These are folks who are currently buying turboprop engines and would instead of overhauling their engine or buying a new engine, would be buying one of Ampaire's hybrid electric amp drives. These amp drives are the ones which save 50 percent fuel burn, and we believe will save on maintenance cost as well. So it'll be good economics for people to switch over to our systems rather than run on their traditional combustion system, and this is where we see the earliest adoption for technology. So begins as retrofits of the existing fleet of turboprops, but then quickly moves into partnering with OEMs, the aircraft manufacturers, for when they build a new airplane, giving it a hybrid option. The next phase is, of course, working on clean sheet design planes with OEMs who are optimizing planes, new designs, around the novel propulsion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Tell us a little bit about your, you have a great history of being an innovator and entrepreneur. Give us some lessons learned to our innovators who are listening today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, it's been eight and a half years at Ampaire. The number one and biggest recommendation I can give is choose something that you deeply love and that you think you can actually achieve. The days get challenging over the course of years as an entrepreneur. It is not easy. It is oftentimes not even fun. But when you know that you're doing the right thing, when you're tackling the most meaningful, challenging, visible problems that you possibly can, it gives the motivation, not just for you as an individual innovator, but truly, these are things done by teams. And when you have meaningful work, and you're thoughtful about it, it enables you to pull together teams of really great people to go do these audacious things. I think the importance of setting tangible and tractable goals that you can actually achieve in the near term is very important. It's not just about moonshots, it's about the steps on how to get there. And, and ultimately, it's about building long standing relationships and not looking for what do I get now or, being short sighted in them, because truly the world is built by people and, and supported by relationships that are built over years or decades. And so, being a good actor in the industry is so important.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, you've acquired companies, you were almost acquired yourself. What advice would you have for people who might be going through a similar process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so always be open to opportunity and thoughtfully assess it. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the opportunity to go public via SPAC was pretty exciting, and there was a whole lot of money on the table, both from company valuations and from operating budgets. But you also have to be willing to change course when it's clear that the course you're on is not the right one, which we did in early 2022. Ampaire pulled out of a deal to go public because we realized that it was, the higher risk path and it was not worth, continuing down that path of going public and getting acquired. These are hard decisions that you need clarity, you need good advisors and mentors to support you on, and ultimately you need to set the ego aside a lot of times and go on good first principles when making your decisions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, thanks a lot.

Rob has five decades of experience in commercial aviation, and I guarantee regardless of who you are or who you work with, you'll love this discussion. So how to describe this talk? It's a blend of the history and promise of aviation and commercial aviation, the role of hubs and why they started and continue, a reality check on aviation and sustainability, the challenge and opportunities for advanced air mobility with the necessary dash of prudence, and a thorough discussion of regional air mobility. It sounds like a lot, but there's a constant theme, the value and promise of aviation, the power of market forces, the need for innovation and not just in technology with prudent optimism laced through the entire conversation. I had lunch with a few friends last week who loved the podcast. Thanks to you both. And they encourage us to keep the introduction short so our guests can get to the meat of the podcast. So for at least this podcast, we listened. So many thanks to Rob for this uplifting and serious conversation and to our many and growing number of guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Rob Britton as you innovate profitably in The Vertical Space.

Great having you with us.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Happy to be here. Thank you for inviting me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>First question. Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I think that I, because I've been around for so many years, most of my perspectives are fairly well aligned with the industry. I think the one place that sort of jumps to mind, and I'm not sure that it's a disagreement necessarily. I think the industry, is, with respect to, sustainability, climate change, emissions, all that stuff. I think the industry, fails to, in their zeal to talk about how, what they're doing with SAF and what they're doing with, fuel cells and all this other stuff. I think that they really fail to tell what I think of as the balanced story and the way that I would explain what I think of as a balanced story, I is this way when I'm in the business school classroom and I, that's where I spend a lot of my life and I give a lecture, particularly when I'm in Europe, and inevitably in Europe, somebody's going to ask me about climate change and airlines, and they may even be quite pointed about it. and I always like to say it this way. I start out and I say, look, commercial aviation is responsible for two to three percent of climate change and gas emissions. It's not 20 percent. It's not 10 percent. It's two to three. Now that's a small percent, but it's a big number, and nobody's in denial. But what, I like to say is I like to think of it in cost benefit terms. Okay, if we own up To 2 3 percent responsibility for climate change gas. What do we get? And the answer is we get an enormous amount of good. Both in terms of all the great things that commercial aviation enables, whether it's adding value to other economic sectors, allowing businesses to grow, providing a foundation for tourism. All of these, all these things. And I think if you frame it in those terms, it's a good way to frame it and I think that the industry seldom kind of puts it in that direction, I think largely because they're trying to put a happy face on it. And I would rather put an honest face on it to say, okay, yes, we own that, we're trying to make it better, but at the same time, we're adding enormous amounts of good and people want to fly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, what is it about the narrative that you're hearing from airlines that is particularly maybe frustrating is a heavy word, I agree with your point we've poked around this topic in our previous episodes, talking about, whether the allocation of capital towards that goal is really going at the right places and will have the desired outcome when you consider the 2 to 3 percent overall, but also when you double click on it and see, what segments of the market are responsible for most of the emissions. And then you end up with a, 15 percent of a 2. 5% Type of problem on and on. So, so that's one side of the conversation, but the airlines are entities that have been around for a long time. They're smart people. They know the business yet sometimes feel the narrative is out of touch with reality. How do you explain\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, it's a great point and a great question, Luka, and I think you're right. It does seem to be a little bit, out of touch. and I think what my basic complaint about the way they frame it up is that, it's all this sort of, fluffy good news, and nobody's really willing to, put some caveats around it. I'm a, I'm a believer in honesty and I think somebody should You know, I think the airline industry needs to say, yeah, we're, we believe in SAF, but let's be honest. It's not scalable at this point. Right. And even if it were scalable, it's going to be expensive. And so, I think a more forthright discussion, at least in some circles, I mean, they don't have to do it, Scott Kirby doesn't have to talk about that when he's making a presentation to the Sierra Club, right? But at some point, there's got to be, I think, a greater amount of honesty, in the debate. whether we're talking about alternative, whatever it is we're talking about, alternative fuels or, whatever else is going on. And, I mean, at the end of the day I think where I, when I really get pushed into the corner, as I would be, for example, if I'm in front of a bunch of students in Sweden, right, home of Greta Thunberg, if I'm really pushed against it, You know, I start to rail about this idea that it's okay for them to fly, right, if they live in Stockholm, and in December and January it's cold and dark and wet. It's okay for them to go to the Dominican Republic to go on the beach, but somehow it's not okay for, a family in India that has just become middle class to take a journey. And so, I'm wavering a little bit, but I get really cranky about this because I think at the end of the day there's a lot of hypocrisy that surrounds all of what we're talking about here. So all I'm saying is let's get rid of the hypocrisy. Let's get rid of the fluff and let's have honest discussion about what we need to do. Now, having said all that, I mean, the arc of things, as an optimist, and I've been an optimist all my life, the arc of things is moving in the right direction. I mean, people are doing the right things. And Luka, you rightly point out, when it comes to capital allocation, that sort of thing. I mean, it's not a perfect world, but we're sort of, maybe it's not correct to say we're moving in the right direction, but we seem to be lurching in the right direction.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Another thing that we brought up in the past in the podcast is that it feels like the airlines are under pressure to innovate where in fact they are the users and the operators of the technology. Do you see that as well from your perspective, right? People are pointing fingers at airlines and say, well, what about this new, more efficient, aircraft or propulsion system Where in fact, they should be turning to the Prats and the, Rolls of the world. Right. And the same, well, what do you have that I can use so that, we can address some of\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I agree with that completely. Yeah, I mean, I think, I agree with you. I think that's a, I think that's a solid point, Luka, but I, in, in the end, it's one of those things where if an airline were to do that, they would end up just getting dragged through the mud. I, so I think that, it's the sort of sense that, we're all in it together, I think is where we need to be. And that, again, that's, one of the points that I always make. to my students, and that is that everyone in the commercial aviation ecosystem understands what needs to be done. No one is in denial. there's nobody that says, this is not an issue. This is not a problem. And so, we all collectively own the problem, but you're exactly right. The people who are distinctly in a position to fix the problem are the people that manufacture engines, and to a lesser extent, are the people that make airframes. and, I mean, and I want to be sympathetic to them because I think, they're working on all these things. But in the background of all this is what I keep saying, and that is people want to fly. And, if you look at, sometimes I see these sorts of, these sorts of interesting collision courses, if we take, the global scale, I look at, the, I look at the, the order announcements At Farnborough last month, for example, and Indigo, in India, I don't know, it's, I lose track of how many hundreds of airplanes they have on order, but that's the reality, right? India is emerging. People are become more and more Indian people are becoming middle class. Their business sector is sort of growing in spite of itself. and people want to fly. And so what we're going to say to them, no, you can't. yeah. I said, anyway, beaten that horse to death, but it is, it's something that I feel really passionate about in that. And so, come back to answering your first question. I think that's what I would say. I think I have a slightly different, maybe not slightly, maybe a fairly significantly different take on the discussion around sustainability and, and climate change.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. and Rob, I would say that this is also, we talked about, oh, it's a propulsion problem. It's an airframe problem. That's where the work needs to be done. I would say it may well boil down to being a petrochemical problem because the most effective path to actually achieving this goal, if that's what people want to do, is to be able to preserve all the existing training, all the existing airframes and create a fuel in a new way that works directly in those systems starting tomorrow. And in that case, then, it's a petrochemical problem and it's, it's those people that we need at the table doing this. And then, oh, by the way, if we solve that, if we find a way to create a sustainable, renewable liquid hydrocarbon fuel, especially if we do it without bio based feedstocks. We're doing it from electricity and water and a carbon source. Well, and that's way bigger than just SAF. That is a new energy storage medium and an extremely powerful one, and one that's so differentiated from batteries that we have anchored ourselves to with the entire renewable energy matrix. That would be literally a massive step forward for civilization if we could do that cost effectively and\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It would. And I've, and again, in keeping with my, my, my realism, but sunny optimism, I think that, we are, everything that I read, and I'm not a, I'm not a physicist, but everything that I read is that, the research is very close on, for example, to being able to sustain a controllable fusion reaction and be able to then take that and scale it up. And if that's, I don't know, I'd love to see it in my lifetime. I'm 72. if it happens in my lifetime, I'll be dancing in the streets. but, if we have a time frame that says it's 20 years off or 30 years off, I think absolutely those kinds of breakthroughs are doable in that sense, whether it's a fusion reactor that generates enormous, virtually unlimited amounts of hydrogen, or it's a breakthrough with other kinds of energy sources that will not, add enormous amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere. Let's bring it on. and, there's, it's clear to me that lots and lots of people, way smarter than us are working on this. And the more that we do, the better and the closer we'll be. So I think, we'll get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Your answer to the opening question is, let's have some realism with some sunny optimism, and let's understand the value that aviation is providing. Let's start the answer to sustainability of, let's first of all remember that these are the things we do for society. That you all take advantage of and they play a very important role while understanding that sustainability is something we, we're only two to 3%, but we're focused on it, but it's not something that's gonna happen tomorrow, but you want a balanced, realistic approach while answering the question. That's frankly a little refreshing. So is there anything else you want to talk about on this topic before we move to the next\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I, I think now, I think the only last thing that I would say is the other thing that makes me absolutely crazy, is when we're singled out, right? When we're thought to be, the only evil polluters that exist in the world. I teach a lot in, I teach a lot in Switzerland, and as they have an enormous dairy industry, right? And as you also know, the world's cattle, have about a 5x impact it's somewhere around 10 percent of climate changing gas, largely from methane that the cows burp. But nobody's going after, the dairy farmer, right? I mean, they are to a, to be fair, there, there are some, green extremists in the Netherlands, which also, they also have a large, dairy industry that are going at this. But I don't want to be singled out. I don't want to be held to be the only evil people around. And particularly in, in the US marketplace where, people still seem to be more than happy to buy enormous pickup trucks, right? And just so you know, we've got a Ford Escape Hybrid that gets 46 miles to the gallon. I ride that bicycle to the grocery store. So, we can't be singled out, and we've got to get back to what you so eloquently say, Jim, and that is this idea of all of this good, and I think to maybe wind this up, that's the part of the story that we're not telling. All of this good.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We should have an episode on those bastard cows, coming out.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what I always say, what I always say to people is, I love milk.

Let's figure out a way to, to redo their biology so they don't burp methane. And we can probably do that in 10 or 20 years, right?

But Rob, give us a perspective, in order to predict what we should be doing in the future we want to understand the past a little bit more. Give us a history of the airline industry, just from a historical overview and lessons that you think may apply\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's great, and I'm looking forward to this little history lesson, if you will. So, I mean, and the thing that's interesting about the airline business, and in fact I was teaching this morning, at Georgetown, where I work part time, and I had to explain that it was a group of MBA students, and I had to explain to them that the airline industry, for the first 50 or 60 years of its existence here in the United States and other parts, will look very different from what it looks like today. So here in America, as you guys know, at the dawn of commercial aviation, in order to stimulate the growth of this new technology, the federal government handed out contracts to carry mail by air and then that slowly worked towards carrying people. And somewhere in the late 1920s was the first effort to create a, essentially, a regulated utility model for the airline industry. They were not going to allow the market to do that to make decisions. So what emerged from the Civil Aeronautics Act in whatever it was 1927 or 28 modified through the 1930s was a regulatory regime that was not just operational regulation but economic regulation. And so for 50 years until 1978, a group of lawyers in Washington made all of the commercial decisions for the airline industry. Most fundamentally, could you start an airline? And the answer was almost always no. So they regulated the most fundamental aspect of the business, and that was market entry. Once you were lucky enough to be licensed to be an airline then the federal government, through these lawyers in the Civil Aeronautics Board, which was the name of the entity, told you where you could fly. And so they doled out, essentially, you could think of them as route licenses, right? And those licenses were doled out to two different types of airlines. There were the so called trunk airlines the remaining survivors are American, Delta, and United, but back in the old days there were brands like Eastern, and National, and Continental, and Northwest, and a whole bunch of them. There were the trunk airlines that carried people longer distances, so from Chicago to San Francisco, or from New York to Boston, just from New York to Miami. And then there was a whole network. Fascinating, vast network of what were called local service airlines. And these were brands like I grew up with in Minnesota, North Central Airlines, or it could be West Coast out on the Pacific Northwest, or it could be Allegheny. Or it could be Piedmont, or it could be Ozark, these kind of funky regional names. And these were companies with smaller aircraft serving smaller markets, generally with a nice subsidy from the federal government. So this Civil Aeronautics Board controlled licensing. Once you were licensed, they controlled routes. Sometimes in the case of local routes, and we're probably going to talk about regional mobility sometime in the podcast. So there was a handsome subsidy that, for example, North Central Airlines collected from the federal government to operate a route from Minneapolis St. Paul to Brainerd, Minnesota, to Bemidji, Minnesota, to International Falls. Small communities, 8, 000 people, 9, 000 people. And this network of these local service airlines really, you can, there's a fascinating map that I actually have on my computer, which I could, if you remind me, I'll share with you. That showed you this vast network. So they doled out market entry, they doled out the routes, they doled out the frequency, so they control supply. If you were given what was called, it wasn't really a license, it was called a route award. If you won the route award for new service from say Minneapolis, St. Paul to Denver, which North Central Airlines got that route award in around 1969, the government told you how many flights, not the marketplace says, there's demand for six flights and we're going to meet the marketplace demand. But the government said, we think it's three. And that's what North Central got. They got three flights a day from Minneapolis, St. Paul to Denver. And they were, of course, happy to have the route, because the, the previous incumbent Western Airlines, now part of Delta, had no competition. So they were, they nibbled a little bit toward the end in the period, sort of roughly 1965 to 1978, with a little bit of gentle competition. But the last thing that they controlled, the fourth thing that they controlled, was price. And they set price in a very interesting and comfortable way if you were a producer. They basically set price at whatever the average cost of production would be, plus a guaranteed profit. So for years, the mantra at the Civil Aeronautics Board was I believe that they were going to set fair levels at a point that would produce a 12 percent return on assets, right? it was just bizarre. And so what, so if, and the, and All of that fair setting was done against average cost of production. So if you figured out, if you were a bright guy and you figured out how could I produce this product, Below the average cost of production, you made your investors very happy. And in fact, interestingly enough, cause I come from Minneapolis, St. Paul, that's exactly the model that Northwest Airlines for years pursued. Now they were very clever about that because the long time CEO, this is maybe more detailed than your listeners want, you can just edit it out, but the long time, here's the fun thing, the long time CEO of Northwest Airlines was a guy named Donald W. Nyrup. I actually knew his son quite well. Don Nyrup's previous job, before he became head of Northwest Airlines, was he was a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board. So he, this is classic revolving door, right? He knew exactly how all this worked. And he said, if if I can produce the product cheaper than anybody else, my investors are going to be really happy. And that was exactly the model that they pursued for a long time. So even, with that idea of average cost of production and a nice, built in cushion, companies still found themselves in financial trouble. They couldn't manage the business. And so, for example, in the, I believe, late 1960s, the CAB, went out and engineered, by leaning on Delta, engineered Delta's acquisition of an airline called Northeast. Northeast was on the verge of running out of cash and they said they need help. And, Delta takes over. And there were a couple of other episodes that were like that, in that. So, so this whole thing is micromanaged by a bunch of lawyers on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D. C. And there was this enormous, I mean it was a big, they took up the whole building. And there was, they had economists and they had all kinds of other people, and obviously an army of lawyers and they, this, all of this, all this whole thing set up to make the decisions that would normally be made in the marketplace.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And who were some of the more successful airlines\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I've already mentioned, I've already mentioned Northwest. Northwest was a good one, a Continental. did very well through most of their, through most of their years. Delta was always very astutely managed. and had, they really had a, very, the government basically gave them a very nice route network. So those are sort of three that, three that, that come to mind. So what happens over 50 or 60 years of intrusive government economic regulation? Well, Costs just keep going up and up because there's no competition. There's no Southwest or JetBlue or Spirit placing downward pressure. And all of the older companies, more or less have the same cost structure.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, it's remarkable that this economic regulation of air travel got put in place so early in the infancy of the industry. And my question is, what was the motivation for that? Who was advocating for this economic regulation? Was this coming from the airlines themselves? Was this to protect their profits? Or was this coming from the government? Or was this just an outgrowth of how society thought about regulation at that point in the 20th century?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The principal issue at hand was in the 1920s and even into the 30s, the planes were falling out of the sky and it was not the safe industry that we, the astonishingly safe industry that we have today. And so the impetus for regulation originally was all driven around safety. And the logic that was able to be sold to politicians in Washington, to the media, to the person in the street, the man or woman in the street, was if we allow the market to decide, if we allow competition in this industry, some company is going to get into financial trouble and they're going to cut corners on maintenance. They're going to cut corners on pilot training and the plane is going to crash and everyone's going to die. That was the kind of logic of the 1920s. Then what happens in October 1929, the stock market crashes and there's this massive meltdown and there's this massive, through the early 1930s, loss of confidence in the genius of the market economy, right, and the, suddenly the market economy is no longer able, the skepticism, both, driven from FDR or whoever else it is, even from, for that matter, moderate Republicans are saying, they can't, we, the marketplace is a good place to be, but it's not perfect. And so certain industries are going to need to be controlled. And so that actually added a layer of legitimacy to this whole regulatory, impetus and it just carried on. And so what's happening? So costs are going up, prices are going up, costs are going up, prices are going up. And essentially the, the reality was, as I said, all of the older airlines, whether they were in the, local service category, Piedmont and Ozark and North Central. Or they were in the trunk category, National and TWA and Western, whoever they were. All of them more or less have, in a range, the same cost structure. Their costs are all going up sort of in lockstep. And so when their costs go up, for example, when the pilots union, and as you know, unions have been a reality in, in, in the transport sector in general, and in, in aviation in particular for decades, the pilots union at United, let's say as an example, in the, 1950s, say, we need a new contract we want to raise. United's management just gave it to them because they knew that they knew two things. First of all they had to do was go to Washington and say our costs just went up. You need to raise fare levels. That was reason one. Reason two was they knew about pattern bargaining. The same reality that exists in automobile manufacturers. When the UAW gets a contract at GM, they take it to Ford. Ford. They take it to Stellantis, and off they go. So the United Pilots knew that the Airline Pilots Association, once they got a deal at United, they were going to shop it to every other airline management group, and all, it goes up and up and up. Then what happens? Boom! Mid 1970s, a nice boom, actually. Mid 1970s, a group of influential economists, led by Professor Alfred Kahn from Cornell University, travel down to Washington, and they say, they meet with the Civil Aeronautics Board, don't get much response. They go up to Capitol Hill, and they say, this is nuts. The technology has been perfected, flying has become safe, planes are basically not crashing anymore, and this mode of transportation, which has essentially been perfected, is available only to the rich. Guys, I've been in this business for 55 years. I started in 1969. as a travel agent to pay for college. My parents were broke and I had to pay for it myself. I was a traveler. When I went out to Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport, the only people I saw at the airport were the well to do. So Alfred Kahn says to the Congress, to whoever will listen, if you deregulate the airline industry and you allow competition to come in, prices will come down and more people will be able to travel. So the impetus was entirely pro consumer. And that's exactly what happened. That's exactly what happened. And so the Airline Deregulation Act is passed on October 24th, 1978, all of this intrusive government regulation starts getting phased out. There's open entry into the industry, provided that of course, you satisfy the basic operational requirements. You get a license to operate. And new airlines are starting up. Routes are opened up. Prices are opened up. Prices and fares immediately come down.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, do you think that early period of economic regulation of air travel was unnecessary? Was it a mistake? Could they have started with regulating safety but not routes and ticket prices?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes, I fervent looking back basically on what I know. They could have created a operational regulatory regime that said, here's what you need to do and then put some teeth into it. That if you fail to do this If you fail to do this and you have an accident that turns out to be traceable back to your negligence, you lose your license. Easy as that, right? So, we can't, you wish that you would have had that kind of mentality. And by the way, guys, as this was not just in the United States. This was global. In fact, it was even, in a very real sense, it was even more intrusive than most of the rest of the world, because the model of the rest of the world was state ownership of the carriers. Now, there is a bad idea, right? Let's put government in charge of Air France or The predecessor of British Airways or just about any airline in the world. But, so it's a great, I mean, I love the musing about, what would have happened and how we would have had far less pain than we have today. Because what has essentially happened since 1978 has been an enormous amount of pain, variably defined, visited upon the older airlines. Because they have, in order to survive have had to figure out a way to lever their costs down in order to get, into a situation that sort of approaches equilibrium with the new players that are coming into the industry. And as you guys know, that lever has mainly been Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which is a very blunt instrument, painful for the workers, painful for retirees, but it has allowed the older airlines, the three remaining older airlines to survive and, to get on with their business. But the fruits of this were evident from the beginning. I mean, you could go back, to the early, late 1970s, early 1980s, and you could see, and I was around back then, and you could, I, you'd see a full page advertisement, in the New York Times for People Express, one of very bold start up carrier saying, we're going to fly you for 59 peak and 39 off peak and people are going, wow, this is really great. And so it has been a remarkable achievement. A democratizing a mode of transport that was only available to the wealthy. And I'll tell you guys to put a sort of a fine personal point on it. I think that reality for me spending my career in the airline industry, that's been to me the most satisfying aspect working for 50 years in and near airlines is that we have made it possible for everyone to fly. We're cheaper than the Greyhound, we're cheaper than Amtrak, and now people can fly. And isn't that a great thing?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to ask you a question about deregulation, but before, I'd like to rewind a little bit and ask whether there were any milestones in the pre deregulation days that you think is worthwhile to call out, whether this is the emergence of the jet age or the point at which air travel became a mass market, perhaps when the contours of today's hub and spoke model\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>35:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, well, there's no question that the advent of a jet powered aircraft, with turbine engines that are far more reliable than, than piston engines, was an enormous breakthrough. And so that dating to, 1958 and being perfected then on and through the early to mid to late sixties with not just, new bigger airplanes like DC 8s and 707s flying, but, the emergence of, smaller jet aircraft that could serve smaller communities. That was, that was a huge breakthrough, from a technological standpoint. and there were probably, there were, not probably, there were certainly, smaller, more subtle, things that changed along the way. I mean, I, one of the, one of the things that we sort of, we take for granted today, is, is the emergence of much better weather forecasting, and just, think about that weather forecasting that was really the methodologies and to a certain extent, the technologies that, that were developed during World War II, particularly in, in the European theater of operations, to allow, good weather forecast to enable the B 25s and B 29s to, to bomb strategic targets in, in Germany. So all of that stuff, right, that found its way into the civilian sector. In fact, one of the great early adopters of that technology, that wartime technology was actually, my hometown airline, Northwest. They had a meteorology department, in the late 1940s, that was the envy of the airline industry. They were like, we're on top of this and, we're going to figure this out. So there were those\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And that was the envy of the industry until they merged with Delta. They always had a premier weather forecasting capability. With meteorologists,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Brilliant. Yeah. And, so there were those kinds of things. Now, over on the economic side, I mean, I think it's worth calling out so that I don't sound like I'm, dumping, just enormous amounts of, of bad stuff on the Civil Aeronautics Board. There were people that were around back then that saw what was going on. People like Will Rist, for example, America's former Government Affairs Senior VP. There, there were people at the CAB. as early as the 1960s, mid 1960s, late 1960s, through the early and mid 1970s, they could kind of see that this was a little bit silly. And they could kind of see that maybe we should allow, maybe we should tinker around a little bit with some experimentation. But It was really just nibbling around. So, you had the emergence, I mean, this is going to sound incredibly quaint to us in, in, in 2024, but, we, you had the emergence of family fares, right? Where, husband and wife, and of course it was a traditional nuclear family, husband and wife, and the kids could go along and the wife got, a one third discount and the kids flew for half fare and, off they went to Disneyland or, go see the Empire State Building. Again, to make this personal and a little bit fun, I first got smitten with the airline industry when I was a teenager, and around the same time that I was smitten by the industry, the Civil Aeronautics Board allowed airlines to offer what were called Youth Standby Fares. So, I could join, and I did, United Airlines, they called it the 12 to 21 club. You were minimum age 12, maximum age 21. If you were in that age window, you could fly for half fare, standby. You couldn't make a booking, but you could fly standby. Oh, and I flew to a lot of places, for half fare. Flying standby, and we know we got stuck once in a while trying to get home or whatever, but for the most part it worked out. So there was a little bit of nibbling along the way, but, nothing, like the, the, what needed to really be.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At what point do you consider the airline industry became a mass industry and when did the hub and spoke\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, well, it's so, it was so, I mean, I'm being, I'm being a little bit, a little hyperbolic when I say that, in the, 1960s and 70s, the only people that could afford to fly with the wealthy. I mean, middle class people were flying and, travel was increasing, travel as a, as a component of discretionary spending was some, was there, in the, in the, in, in the post war boom, as the economy expanded rapidly, what, what did middle class people do? They, they bought a bigger house, they bought the wife a car, and then, once that was all sort of fixed up, they started to travel, so people were traveling and, and it was becoming, it was on its way, to, to becoming, a mass business. Now, around that time, a number of very forward thinking, not a large number, a small number actually of forward thinking companies started saying maybe within this constraint of the federal government of the Civil Aeronautics Board handing out routes, maybe we could organize a route network in a way that enabled the evolution of the hub. Right. And of course, the pioneer in this was Delta Airlines. I mean, you go down to Atlanta, Hartsfield Jackson Airport today, and you see this massive hub, the biggest one, essentially the biggest one in the world. But that hub, it really existed even in the 1960s, right? And as early as the 1960s, people in the South said, when you die You might go to heaven, or you might go to hell, but you're probably going to get through Atlanta. So they had that idea down, and that's what they had. Now, interestingly, and to be fair, United did a little bit of that hubbing at Chicago and Northwest did a little bit of that hubbing at Minneapolis St. Paul, and Continental did a little bit. Nobody had anything quite as well developed as Delta. Now, fast forward to, October 1978 and the deregulation of routes and the idea that now an airline could configure their routes in a way that made business sense. And the hub and spoke model then emerged very quickly as the way to move people around a geographically vast country. People say to me, why do we have these things? And people oftentimes ask that question living in a place like Chicago or Washington or New York where they can fly non stop to anywhere in the world. But if you live in Medford, Oregon, or Tuscaloosa, Alabama, or Traverse City, Michigan, you don't have a non stop to even to Boston or to San Francisco. And so, the hub and spoke concept became, an enormously sensible way to move people across a geographically vast nation like the lower 48 of the United States. And from across, a place where population was pretty broadly distributed. It was, of course, an urban population, but not everyone lived in big metropolitan centers. You might live in Birmingham, Alabama, or in Portland, Oregon. And if you lived in Birmingham or Portland and you were on your way to Sarasota, Florida, there was probably not an airline that could operate that route, even without the constraints to operate that route, go in and make money. I always like to explain it. I was going to actually bring them up today. I was, because I oftentimes bring props to class and I talk about how hub and spoke airline model is really like two funnels where the narrow end of the funnel faces each other and the hub is in the middle of the funnel. So they're collecting traffic from all over, flights coming in. Say Delta, flights are coming in from the west. And they're landing at Atlanta and they're going off to the east or coming in from the south and going to the north. And these hubs are, for the most part, directional. because that's, logically the way that you would organize. So these things end up working really well,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is it a fair observation that once the government control was removed over routes and fares, with the deregulation act in 1978, the major carriers focused on the most profitable routes, which ended up being these trunk routes. And with easier access to the market, you had this emergence of regional airlines that started with code chairing with major airlines and started connecting smaller communities to these larger hubs. And so, is that a point where we really start to see, the concept of a regional airline emerge, and can you talk about how that segment evolved and how they then later ran into\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's Absolutely right. and so to use an example close to home, before deregulation, so in the old regulated environment, an airline called North Central Airlines based in Minneapolis, St. Paul, operated a route, with subsidy, up to northern Minnesota, up to the smaller communities in northern Minnesota. The subsidies, for the most part, went away with deregulation. There was this thing called the Essential Air Services Provision, which was put in. but for the most part, the, airlines needed to find a new model for collecting people from smaller communities. in the old days when there was, when there were aircraft suited to this and there was in some cases subsidy, in some cases a cost structure that allowed airlines to serve these smaller, that was what happened. Very quickly, a company like Northcentral, which now had the freedom to grow, ended up actually merging with a couple of smaller airlines and became an entity, a brand called Republic. They could no longer, and I was around, this is when I got in the business in 1984 they could no longer serve these points economically, these small communities economically. And so they then began, they then turned to these regional airlines that operated on a franchise model, right? Paint your airplanes to look like ours, sign a contract to conform to service standards. We'll take care of of setting the prices, we'll take care of running the commercial side. You get involved with the operational side. And as in the regional airline ecosystem, there's a bunch of different models for how those companies get paid. But for the most part, nowadays, it's what's called fee per departure where the company, whether it's SkyWest or whomever, Air Wisconsin, they get paid. For every flight they, every flight they run and the airline takes care of collecting all the revenue and managing it. And that model got built out. That model really starts to be built not long after deregulation and in, and in fact, some forward thinking, larger airlines like American with their American Eagle brand, and United, with, I think they called it United Express from the get go, starting to franchise with these independent operators, to provide service to these smaller communities, and the whole thing takes off and, 40 years later, we now have this network, that, has evolved, works pretty well, but, as you guys, as you just suggested, has some problems related to the economics of small jet aircraft related to, the salary structures for these smaller companies, so on and so forth. I, again, my sunny optimism says that, a lot of these issues that were being talked about with a lot of vigor five or eight or 10 years ago, about pilot shortages in the regional sector, are for the most part being sorted out and the way it gets sorted out is by raising their salaries. And these companies are able to do that and continue to provide, the kind of service that people want. So the, in the regional environment, I mean, if you think about, if you think about small cities, small communities, small and medium sized communities in the United States, my sense is that the system works pretty well. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well. And there are just for all I've, while I've got this, there have been a number of different models. that have been tried. I mentioned, the so called essential air services model that the federal government administers, which basically is, for the most part, a failure. To me, when we're talking about regional air service, the most successful model in my view is something called the minimum revenue guarantee. And this concept was actually pioneered in resort towns in the Mountain West that were seeking to have a greater sense of reliable air service. And so I believe that the first resort towns that pursued this is winter resort towns, were Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Vail, Colorado. And this goes back to the late eighties or early nineties, and they contracted with American and American came up with this minimum revenue guarantee concept. They said, well, how much service do you want from where? And they said, well, you know what we want one flight from Dallas, one from Chicago, blah, blah, blah, blah. So American came up with it with a number that they needed, which was basically their costs probably with, and with some baked in profit. And they gave them the number and they said to the resort and it was usually done through a chamber of commerce or a local economic development authority or some either private or public private partnership. They said, look, here's the number. we'll market the flights. We'll sell the flights. And at the end of the year, we'll just do the numbers. And if you meet the revenue threshold, you're golden and if you don't, you write us a check to make us whole. The interesting thing about those, the way those structures are is that, as I recall, the airline didn't give anything back if they wildly exceeded the guarantee. So, and they started, so they started out doing this for tourism destinations, and then they widened it out and, for example, one of the more recent just ordinary communities was a place called Roswell, New Mexico, town of, I don't know, 20,000 people in eastern New Mexico. This goes back about a dozen years, and at that point, rather than American doing it with their mainline, because their, those planes would have been too big, they did it through their Eagle Regional Airline, and it was the same concept they said to the city of Roswell or whoever it was out there that was doing this. Look, here's what we need. And off they went, and it has worked spectacularly well. It's worked so well, in fact, that the initial service pattern was from Roswell East to the big hub in Dallas, Fort Worth. And I believe, and you could check the schedules, but I believe that they've since built it out to it, to have at least one or two flights from Los Angeles of all places. So, here's this little town and the dusty high plains of New Mexico with pretty nice connectivity. That model has been very successful and has in fact been used by a number of other airlines. And just to finish that concept off, you guys may be aware there's actually a number of consulting firms that work with local communities to try to build air service. And this minimum revenue guarantee. concept is just one of the many things that are in their arsenal. And these are both for sort of tourism dependent communities, as well as, as well as just sort of ordinary places. So that's an interesting concept. What I like about it is it's a market based concept. It's not something, where the government's going to come in, where there's going to be a lot of political shenanigans and pork belly, pork barrel stuff. And so it's a nice solution and it has been very successful for the communities that have pursued it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>How prevalent is the use of that mechanism today?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, it's still, and so the other, so carrying that forward, one of the interesting things is that in a number of these, resort communities they started off with the minimum revenue guarantee and they were just able to be weaned off of it because, you know, the market, the route got built up, the service got built up, so on and so forth. In addition to American, I, quite honestly guys, I don't know who else is pursuing it besides, yeah, I'm pretty sure that Alaska Airlines has, I don't know if they're still doing it in the winter from, I believe, Seattle into some of the interior ski destinations in British Columbia, a place called Kamloops, which has a couple of, smaller, but growing ski resorts. And then the other people that are using it, I believe in Canada, in Eastern Canada is Porter. You may know about them, Porter Airlines. they, they're, historically a Q400 operator, but now they've just recently taken delivery of E195s and are building out their service pattern. But Porter was running, I believe, a minimum revenue guarantee into a number of ski resorts in Quebec and in Eastern Canada.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So we talked about regional air travel, how they came to exist, and the kinds of pressures that they have started to feel over the last maybe two decades or so. What's your assessment of the current state of regional air travel, and are you seeing opportunity in new technology, whether this is electric propulsion or increasing autonomy to remove some of the economic pressure that caused the contraction of this segment?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>My sense is that if we think about conventional small jet technology, I think the service patterns that, companies like SkyWest or Air Wisconsin or the owned subsidiaries like Delta's, company Endeavor. That whole thing seems to be fairly stable. And again, I'm, I confess I'm a little bit removed from some of the to and fro on that, but I'm not seeing, for example, in the airline, trade publications, the industry publications like Aviation Week or Aviation Day. I'm not really seeing, people squawking about pilot shortage and so on and so forth. And as I suggested earlier on in the conversation, I think that, a lot of the pilot shortage of 5, 6, 10 years ago was really related to money. Once they've given these guys a raise and a signing bonus, they don't seem to be having much trouble attracting young pilots into the system. And I know for a fact that all of the regionals recruit very heavily in those universities that have ab initio pilot training programs, like the University of North Dakota or the University of Nebraska, Omaha, and. there's a handful of schools that, four year universities that do that. So I think that's, so full stop, let's shift now and, look at the new technology on the horizon. And, even though some of it seems, a bit further out, it's pretty clear that, companies like Heart, Aerospace in Sweden, building out these 30 passenger hybrid, aircraft. I think this is very exciting because my sense and I haven't seen any data, but my sense just maybe in a very simplistic sense as an owner of a hybrid automobile my sense is that the economics of a hybrid aircraft with a, 30 passenger and, I'm sure once they're successful with that, they'll build it up to, 50 is very exciting. And so you've got that as just sort of hybrid propulsion, the, and again, my knowledge of the players is small, but there's, I know that there's a handful of people that are building out, a pure battery solution, in a, in a smaller package. And that stuff, I mean, that's all very exciting because I think that, that will at least start to attack the, fuel related part of operating into small communities with, with RJs. The interesting thing, if we take this sort of long view of regional service, long being say 40 years, if we go back and look at the operating economics of a, of an airplane, like the Saab 340, that was a very economical airplane to operate in terms of fuel burn, 30 passengers, as I recall, something like that, and then, the, the pure jet aircraft that Bombardier was delivering started to come on and Embraer and, you know, all of a sudden those became very popular. But you know, What happens when oil spikes up? A lot of those aircrafts start to get a little bit marginal, especially in the 50 seat range. So, so the new technology, whether hybrid or pure battery, I think will at least address, some of the energy related issues. And if that's addressed and the labor issues are sort of sorted out, then I think, the prospect looks pretty bright. And indeed, depending on, where things go with, with autonomous, operation, you could start to see something looking very attractive in terms of being able to serve smaller communities. I mean, to me, it's not entirely impossible to foresee a regional airline map that looked more like what it did in the regulated period when all that service was so massively subsidized. So that let's say a city of 10 or 15, 000 people in the Great Plains could expect to have connectivity to a major hub.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, do you think that the hybrid or electric capability why should they better serve those communities in the future? If they're profitable routes, today they could be served from a gas turbine engine. Why do they have to be electric or hybrid?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>no, yeah, I'm not, yeah, I'm not sure I was clear enough. No, what I think I was saying is that for example, a hybrid airplane might be able to provide, supplemental service to, a city that has jet service, so imagine, I don't know, I'm going to take an example. Let's take, let's take Bismarck, North Dakota, the capital of North Dakota. They probably enjoy, I haven't, I'm looking at a schedule, but Delta Connection flies to Bismarck, probably four times a day, five times a day from Minneapolis, St. Paul, from their big hub there. Maybe with a hybrid aircraft, they could serve, they could add some trips in the middle of the day. Alternately, there might be the possibility that the attractive, energy economics of these newer, of this new technology might allow a service to places that don't have it today that would very much like to have it. And you could conceive of a combination of what we spoke about a moment ago, a minimum revenue guarantee. So now let's go down to a, a very small city of say 15, 000 people, and maybe it's just an ordinary place. Maybe it's a resort place or a tourism dependent place. Now they could contract with SkyWest or Air Wisconsin or whomever to bring in a 30 passenger hybrid airplane into a very small place. So you might actually see more dots on the map. And again, hard to know where we would be, but at least what I know about the, the potential economics of these things, that would be, that's not infeasible. So I hope, does that help a little bit?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>does, thanks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, has Heart announced what their efficiency gain or operating cost will be for that 30 person aircraft? I mean, I'm curious as what is it relative to like a narrow body jet, like a 737 or an A320, and what is it relative to another 30 person aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I don't know what that is, but I would encourage you to look. I just, I remember about four or five months ago, I was actually, I was teaching over in Europe and somebody mentioned, they said, there's this Swedish company that's working. So I dug it out and I looked very briefly at their website. So I'd encourage you to, they're called Heart Aerospace and they're in Gothenburg, Sweden. and I bet they've got some, I mean, there's probably some promises there, and as you guys know, it's always once the aircraft is in service that where you really see whether it's actually performing to the promised economics, and I could tell you a lot of funny stories about that, in conventional aircraft, but, I suspect it's going to be a pretty significant, efficiency gain and especially vis a vis, anything in that category. And, the problem guys is that basically that 30 passenger, aircraft size has basically gone away. There's nobody, there's almost nobody flying something like that anymore. I mean, there's a couple of small operators that are keeping, Beach 1900s in the air that are about, 20 passengers. So, they might find a niche is\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is it because the market doesn't exist?

I mean, I think that, you could look at the small end of a regional aircraft and there's really nothing there anymore. And so I, I think that they're onto something. With a, with a 30 seat airplane. And I have to believe that they'd, once they prove that they'd build it out to a larger capacity. And if they do that, I think they're going to have economics. it's a turboprop as I understand it. and if it's a speedy turboprop, the block times into a, you know, on a 200 or 300 mile service are going to be pretty comparable to a pure jet.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp>CHAT GPT says it's a 30 percent reduction in operating cost compared to traditional regional jets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, there you have\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>true, then it must be\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, that's exactly right.

Assuming that new technology comes online and now we have electrified aircraft that, lower the cost per flight or a per mile, whatever is more relevant for regional air travel. And, and this value generated for airline, how does the airline get to keep that value? Do we end up in a situation where the business model changes, where OEMs become the operators, and now they have this privileged access to this cornered resource, and they get to keep the added profits. Or will it be, everybody has access to these aircraft, so now we're back to the usual, low profitability airline models. How do you think that this will change the structure of the network and the overall profit distribution along the value chain?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, that's a super interesting question, guys. and, the, I was smiling when you, and when you introduced it, because, one of the things that I tell my business school students is that if we look at the commercial aviation value chain, once you get to the people that actually operate the stuff, there's not much left over. It's all the other guys that are taking, their generous slices of the pie. but you throw out a really intriguing idea, that, I mean, you'd have to go back to, almost to the dawn of commercial aviation when there were in fact OEMs that were the operators. That model does not exist, has not existed, and it's an intriguing idea. I suspect at the end of the day, and again, who knows, I've never been very good at prediction, but at the end of the day, even though the concept might be there, the notion that the manufacturer would actually then become the operator, I don't know, it's a little tricky. Just because I think, the OEMs, they could conceivably go in and say, okay, we're gonna, we're going to operate, let's take, let's just muse for a moment, since this is a thought experiment, let's just muse for a moment and say that these guys Heart they're building airplanes in Sweden. And Sweden is a geographically large, but empty country central places, there are small cities of 10 or 20, 000 people throughout the country that want to get to Stockholm to go shopping or see a show or whatever, do business in the capital. So you could conceive that Heart would say, we're going to make the airplane and we're going to operate the airplane in Sweden, right? And so, they get an operating license from, the Swedish government and they start flying. It's conceivable they could make that work, but at the same time, they're going to want to sell that airplane globally. And I can't foresee that, a relatively small company is going to want to ramp up. There's nothing that would keep them from doing that, but would want to ramp up and become, if you will, a global operator, all over with, with operating licenses and, 20, 30, 40 countries, but it's not out of the question. I mean, but it's a interesting possibility. If we look at the history of commercial aviation, though, I think we see a situation where, the, what was that, the wonderful phrase that one of the, business savants of the early 80s, always talked about, maybe it was Jack Welch or somebody like that, always talked about stick to the knitting. In other words, let's focus on doing the things that we know how to do best. And so, the OEMs make the airplanes and the commercial airlines operate them and there's not much in between. But again, nothing to keep them from trying that out as a model.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What do you think, needs to happen either with technology or the market side that would enable and accelerate the point to point network topology as opposed to the hub and spoke?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, well, I think that I think you're already seeing some successful business models here in the United States, airline business models, where the point to point, is the nature of the route structure. and it's, it's basically David Neeleman with Breeze and, and the guys at Avelo both of those companies, which, I always like to point out to my students, my Either in a moment of incredible bravery or stupidity, both of those airlines took wing during the pandemic and they're growing like crazy, right? And, they have picked out opportunistic places like New Haven, Connecticut and Burbank, California, Hollywood, Burbank Airport for Avelo. Neeleman is getting as big as he can in, in Westchester County, but as that airport is constrained, but he's finding these places where, you've got a pool of, a pool of, middle class, upper middle class, well to do people that want to travel and that they don't want to drive to and get stuck in traffic, making their way to LAX or JFK or whatever. So, so you're seeing some of this going on. Now, the reality is that, as the hub and spoke behemoths, Delta, United and American, every time they get a new regional jet or, either it's one of their owned companies or a franchise, every time one of those new aircraft are delivered, the economics of a hub say, put it into the hub and add another spoke. But these point to point guys are out there in the thing about, and where Breeze and Avelo are different is Avelo is, strictly single aircraft type 737 800. but Neeleman has found the sweet spot with the astonishing economics of the A220. and that plane has just astonishingly low seat mile costs. My friend, Ben Baldanza, who is on the JetBlue board we were having coffee a couple of years ago and we were talking about the A220 because JetBlue is now putting it into service, replacing their E190s. And their, the seat mile cost of the A220 is like 50 percent of what the E190 was. So with economics like that you're probably going to end with the capability of that airplane it's not just low seat mount cost. It's the fact that airplane has the range capability to go coast to coast. Neeleman is flying Breeze airplanes from Westchester to San Francisco and and Los Angeles. And so you can conceive of people looking at, at flows, traffic flows in the United States and finding, and this is what, I mean, Neeleman is doing this right now with the A220, finding, what's the next opportunity? And I think you could probably foresee some other people wanting to jump into that business with that particular airplane, because it is so capable and so economic and, we're, we're, we could conceivably see some additional sort of conventional, if you will, jet, turbine powered jet aircraft like that. But, we're starting, as you guys know, we're starting to approach, the laws of thermodynamics in terms of how much more efficiency can we extract from a gas turbine engine but, it's conceivable that somebody might get in and, build an airplane that's maybe even smaller than an A220, maybe it's a hybrid airplane, the, people are, people are clever and they're finding new things to do.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, I'd like to get your thoughts on the viability of the on demand airline model. There have been many attempts in the past, none really successful, yet entrepreneurs continue to try. Do you think the assets can be utilized enough to make these on-demand routes possible? Are new, cheaper aircraft the solution, or is it a structural problem that's tough to fix?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think it's a, I think it's tough to fix. I think you could see a way to have a limited success in, a small array of markets. And the problem with that is that, you then need to find demand that only needs to go in those limited numbers of markets, so people traveling up and down between Los Angeles and the Bay Area, I don't even know if that on demand outfit is still flying out on the way out in those markets in California. I mean, it could exist. It's limited. And you get other kinds of, you get other kinds of on demand models. I mean, if we're talking about, for example, Wheels Up, that Delta has just sunk a bunch more money into, you just wonder about whether they can, whether they can actually make that work vis a vis, the other kinds of, models that, that exist in, if you will, business aviation, the NetJets and the rest of those kinds of things. I mean, Wheels Up, if you look at their, if you look at their concept, if you look at their website, you look at thinking, well, there's got to be a market for that. And yet, they've struggled. I think to be honest with you guys, just not to, I know a little bit about them because I was working for a couple of years with a marketing professor at Wharton that I know very well. And we had, he was wanting to write a, Harvard case study about Wheels Up. And so we had a bunch of conversations with their chief marketing officer. It was pretty clear that even though they might have had a pretty good concept, they didn't really have an idea of how to go in and tap the market. So I, I think that, I think what ends up happening, and I think maybe to your question, Luka, about sort of structural issues. I mean, I, I'm a, most of my career in the airline business has been on the marketing and planning side. And I just, I think to myself, there's just, there's something about these on demand services that it just somehow, it's not a question of awareness because the people who are very affluent, that can afford to, travel this way, know about these things, but they've never been able to really get traction. So, I don't know, but having said that, if you put that, if you put the on demand concept together with, the array of new technology that's coming at us at a fairly rapid clip, you may possibly see in the future, some of these companies beginning to get traction, depending on how they do it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So given that you're talking about regional immobility, you're talking about on demand, how do you see the next 10 years playing out? What's a high probability occurrence as it relates to the commercial airlines, the introduction of electric hybrid, potentially eVTOL, STOL. And, what do you think is likely to occur\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, yeah, step one is that all of this stuff that's being developed, has to be built, and it has to be certified. And you guys know that, certification is not an easy task, these guys will get there. And so once the stuff is built and certified, I, I think you're going to find buyers. I mean, there are, as the big players have made token investments in a lot of this new technology, and so, they're, people are ready for this stuff. If we take it down to the scale of the regional network, I think it's, it's, it's my sense is that it's sort of field of dreams if you build it, they will come if somebody is out there and I'll just come back to Heart for a minute because I'm much taken with this idea of a hybrid. if they start delivering this airplane and it's, it's fulfilling the economics that, that they're doing. I think you're going to see some interesting stuff, but, I don't know, guys, I, maybe it's the function of fact that I'm 72 years old, but, 10 years, it strikes me that things in commercial aviation tend to move fairly slowly. So, I could foresee that by 2034 we're not going to see revolutionary changes, and especially, if we start to look at, you know, UAM and stuff like that, where there's just so many institutional barriers, so many political barriers, the, as you guys know, the pilot union is already spending a lot of money in Washington saying, we're never going to, you guys can never allow a commercial aircraft, no matter how big or small, to be operated without people piloting it, right? So there's just, you just, I tend to be, and maybe it's a function of the fact that I live 10 miles from the capital of the Republic and all the regulatory and political apparatus, but I'm a little bit skeptical about some of that stuff. So, I don't know. I think we're gonna, I think if I crystal ball 2034, I'm going to see some interesting changes on the margin, but I'm not seeing anything really revolutionary.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, decarbonization aside, what are some of the most important challenges that the airline industry is facing and grappling with today that, we'll need to find a solution to in the coming years?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I think that, for older companies, whether we're talking about the three legacies in the United States, and certainly all of the older companies in Europe, the labor cost issue, has been, for 50 years or longer and continues to be, a big deal. Right. And, you've got powerful trade unions, that, that have a lock, and institutionalized and guaranteed through law lock on contracts with legacy carriers here and in Europe and, they all want more money. And so you've got, that, that is, to me, again, as a long time observer for older companies, that's absolutely where it is, it's the cost pressures continue to be there. What else has gone on? I mean, we've, we simply have to, and I don't want to minimize this because it's huge. We simply have to find a way in the United States to split off, as they have done in most other industrial countries, the air traffic control function. the whole ATC system is held together with duct tape and bailing wire. And it's just, it's just got to be modernized and it will never be modernized under the current regime of being operated by the FAA. Now, you got Yeah,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:16:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp>separate podcast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:16:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>it is a problem. Yeah, absolutely. And I'd be happy to come back and yak with you about that. But that's a, that's a huge one as well. and then, what else is going on? I mean, you've got infrastructure challenges in, all of the big airports, there's not enough runway capacity, there's not enough terminal capacity, and so, the, Pete Buttigieg's solution to that is, well, let's, let's constrain the legacy carriers from continuing to grow at O'Hare or Kennedy or whatever, rather than the obvious solution is let's build more aviation infrastructure. But of course, politically, they can't do that because, there's, all these people whining about carbon emissions and all the rest of that. So, it's just, to sort of conclude, it continues to be a fascinating industry because there is just so many moving parts, not the least of which is the continued intrusiveness of national governments and the operation of the industry.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You've been given a hundred million dollars and you have to invest it in the industry. The return has to come within 10 years. What's going to get the bulk of the investment? What's not going to get any investment?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Wow. I, I get it. I think it depends, I think that's a really hard question to, to answer because it depends on who's holding the wallet with the hundred million dollars in it, right? I mean, if it's a, if it's a legacy carrier, they're gonna buy, they're gonna buy increasingly fuel efficient and capable new aircraft at the, at the larger size of the spectrum. So, the A350 or whatever, they're gonna buy A321s in the middle size. They're probably gonna start to build out more of these A220 smaller aircraft. if you're a, if you're a startup, and you're holding the 100 million wallet, you're gonna, you're gonna be buying, A220s, and you're going to be buying, these, these new, these newer propulsion technologies, hybrids or pure battery to the extent that they're able to be demonstrated to be effective and safe and stuff. And so, I wish I could be more, I wish I could be more articulate there, but as you guys know, I'm not a finance guy.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, but you're a lot. Listen, there are a lot of people listening, Rob, who may not know you, who are thinking, this guy's unbelievable. And they're, they think this podcast is a great discussion. Talk, tell a little bit about what you're doing today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I still do, a little bit of consulting in the sector. And I think that the companies that come to me, are people that want a holistic understanding of how the airline business works somebody with some gravitas and gray hair, and I have a gray hair, not very much of it. But I, I'm, I'm a person that when I approach a, a challenge when I'm given a business problem by a big company like Delta or a smaller manufacturer or a startup software company, I try to look at the problem holistically and I try to bring together, marshal together all of the experience that I have, in understanding how the airline business works. So, if somebody comes to me with this, what they believe to be an absolutely sterling idea about to, bewilderingly new technology. I have to give them a cautionary tale about certification and how long it takes to get stuff done by the government. So, so that's the sort of put over on that side. The other thing that I really do apart from, what takes up a lot of my time and that's being a invited guest lecturer in business school classrooms because I derive an enormous amount of joy from that. But the other thing that I do on the consulting side is, people hire me to explain how the business works to newcomers. And so just as an example of that, one of the big legacies, brought me in a year ago because they had just brought some new VPs on board that had come from outside of, the airline business and they needed to get up to speed very quickly. And that's what I do. I can explain how, airlines work. And so I sort of can deliver an Airlines 101 to an airline company, to a supplier, to an airport. I'm doing, that's, yeah, so that's kind of what I do.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>do it, you would do it very effectively, just based on our talk, Rob.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>thank you. so much.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You've been doing this for a while, as you've reminded us. Who are some people that have knocked you over in the last 50 years who you think are the top couple in the industry? And then who are some people today that you pay a lot of attention to?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I think, look, I don't know either. I don't know the Avelo guys at all. I, the guy that's the CEO is the former chief financial officer of United. I don't, but he, those people are obviously very brave people. They're knocking me over right now frankly, the whole decision to build out New Haven Airport is just, to me, is just a total stroke of genius. Neeleman with Breeze. I mean, here's a guy that started off in Utah with a little company called Morris Air, sold it to Southwest, started JetBlue, built Jet blew up, left JetBlue, started Azul in Brazil. I mean, this guy's a, he's a, he's a complete, clever guy. And, and there's a lot of other people that are like that, that, that are there that, some of the, the older guys that have been around for a long time, all the, the senior guys at Indigo, have an amazing track record. if I, to be honest, and maybe this is a good place to end, without getting myself in trouble with them place where I used to work at American. I look at Ed Bastian at Delta, is, and his leadership team, are absolutely building, a remarkable company. And, the, yeah, they had a, they had a huge, set back with the whole, the whole cybersecurity blow up with CrowdStrike a month ago. But that's a, and that was painful and it was a ding on their brand, but by and large, their trajectory has been forward and they are producing, probably the world's most consistent airline product. So those are guys that, that I look at. And again, those are all people on the operating side, because that's kind of where I spend most of my time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What have we not asked that you would like to answer?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think you've covered, we've covered a lot. and I've really, I've really enjoyed it. and it's been, it's been a great conversation.

Where would you advise them to go and innovate in the aviation value chain?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I would advise them to go and innovate in places that are realistic. I mean, you guys know that, billions and billions, have been and continue to be invested in, in these new technologies and not all these guys are succeeding. And so we're starting to see shaking out in, in eVTOL and a lot of this other stuff that's there. So if you've got entrepreneurs that are looking to invest, my, my guidance is just be very careful about this and don't believe, the pitch deck, and when you talk to the people and listen to the pitch deck, ask some really hard questions based on the fact that, we're already seeing, a lot of the companies that have attracted billions in venture capital, going belly up. So I, I'm a, I'm a believer in prudence. And I think prudence is a good thing when you've got money to invest.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Maybe that's the headline.

And this is where I come to Israel. I invite companies, first of all, to come see what's going on here. We have been very open and we invite everyone to come and witness with their own eyes, not Zoom, not video calls. Coming, meeting the companies, being in our control center, and then come fly because you're gonna hit that problems at one point or another. So start that early. Sure, you're taking a bit more risk that your drone might have a malfunction. But if you do it over an uninhabited area, then come on, start flying. Let's put up a USSP first in a remote area.

This discussion has layers of value to include what makes Israeli aerospace unique, which includes that it's one of the more threatened airspaces in the world. We also discuss the Israel National Drone Initiative. A very impressive program, how it started, who started it, which may surprise you the program itself and the results to date. We discussed costs and profitability of drone operations, and how costs may be different in Israel versus other parts of the world. Listen to Libby's 1, 10, 100 and how it relates to profitability. It's amazing to hear about the use of drones and the management of the airspace in light up the current war in Israel. And how Israel managed the use of drones in the first minutes and hours of the war. Simply amazing. We spent a fair amount of time discussing the different impressive evaluations that have taken place. And what parts of advanced air mobility may be at scale today as a result. And what elements of advanced air mobility Libby sees scaling in the coming years. And what do you think he's most impressed with with advanced air mobility today? The answer may surprise you. I'll give you a clue. Listen to one of our more recent podcasts for the answer. So many thanks to Libby for his entertaining and important conversation. And to our listeners we hope you enjoy our talk with Libby Bahat as you profitably innovate and The Vertical Space. Libby has been working in the Israeli CAA for the past 15 years as the Head of Aerial Infrastructure Department. Libby is a qualified ATC, an instrument flight procedure designer, a Lawyer, and he holds an American private pilot license. Within the Israeli CAA from 2020 Libby is also in charge of the UTM/ U-Space implementation within Israel. Libby, welcome to the Vertical Space Podcast. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Thank you. Thank you so much. It's an honor being here.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What do very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I wouldn't know where to start. as we're following the European regulation. the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority, was in a good position to have a choice, to which regulation do we want to follow? Do we want to make one completely from scratch on our own? We're not a part of EASA. We're not a part of Europe, of the EU. Obviously, we're not under the jurisdiction of the FAA. So, we were in a unique position. And we looked at a couple of sets of regulations. Obviously, the European set and the American set, when again, we're looking at the ATM part of, of UAS, of, UTM, Unmanned Traffic Management. Eventually we chose, the European set, the EASA set of rule regulation 664 and it's, all, its, cousins, 665, 666 and so on. And as you recall, the basic, architecture is referring to a couple of U-Space service providers. So, a USPACE, let's say, over a city or over an urban airspace, and then the unit that will manage the traffic will be the USSP, UAS Service Provider, and a USPACE Service Provider, and it is supposed to give four basic services, ATM, conformance monitoring, geo awareness. Flight Authorization Services. So, even with that basic architecture, we had many debates.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm going to interrupt real briefly, if I may. Thank you for that introduction. But what's controversial behind what you just said? What does somebody not agree with you on based on how you've started this process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the basic infrastructure of four major services, just as a first example, we had questions, whether traffic management, the fourth service, you might say the fourth, obligatory service, mandatory service. We were not sure, we're still not sure, I'm not sure that's why I'm having a lot of debates about it in Israel, is better than having conformance monitoring, which is considered not a mandatory service. So we have questions about which are the correct, the better, you might say, four basic services. That's one thing I'm in discussions, let's say, a disagreement is a strong word. The second thing is having multiple USSPs in one UAS airspace. Again, there are many people, I'm one of them, that thinks this is so far ahead, and this is not the way that the average city will develop. So I'm not really sure that everyone is focused on, in these projects, in the our initiative and in many other projects, that there should be multiple, uSpace service provider in every uSpace. I'm not sure this is the architecture that we'll see at least in the the next couple of years, maybe 10 years from now, for sure, five years from now. So, so that's the second thing. I'm, you could say in disagreement. A third example we can talk about is, who will enjoy UTM? Will it be the average citizen? Will I get, like everyone expects, their coffee and sushi and hamburger and pizza? I don't think so. And I started many conventions with a picture of the soup Nazi from Seinfeld that says, No soup for you. Because I don't think, based on the current business case and looking at the cost, that the average citizen will receive a delivery by a drone in the next couple of years. I think it'll take longer than that. I think the public as a whole, municipalities, Police, different government offices. They will be the main users, of course, emergency services and health. So the third thing I might say is that, I don't think the average citizen will enjoy it, in the next year or two. Fourth thing I thought about mentioning is the conspicuity devices. So, how do we integrate crewed traffic into, the U-Space? Which technology would we use as a conspicuity device? Europe is very focused on ADS- low, ADS B, many different kinds of, new technology. And again, I'm in a lot of conversations with our colleagues about using things that are more common. I know about the Israeli, GA industry. Aircrafts are very old and, I don't see people installing new technology new devices in there. So I think people will use what's already in there. For example, Mode S, and then enhancing the capabilities of Mode S. or, and again, these are things that, that came up. Cellular devices. So, using our cellular phone as a tracking, as a conspicuity device. So, this is just a short of four topics that I'm, I have difficult with,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's terrific. I have to first say, usually pulling this answer out of people is not easy, but you gave us four things that people disagree with you on. Let me ask you on one of them. We had a terrific podcast last week, with, Bobby Healy from MANNA. I came away,a real believer of the initial value of the drone delivery being the high volume, now with MANNA, profitable coffee delivery is kind of a foundational start, to home delivery. You may not disagree with that. What you may be saying, I just want you to give a little more detail here. A little more light. Are you saying that the emergency services, the police services and all are taking the first priority for a reason, having nothing to do with economics or capability or delivery or profitability? You're just saying that for whatever reason, with your experiences, you feel the emergency services and the police will take priority.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I have to make, two different views on what we're talking about when we're talking UTM and USPACE. To have a segregated area and deliver, a cheap item from point A to point B, that's not what I'm interested in. I'm interested in managing large scale operations, multiple companies over urban areas, with a nice and good competition, and how do we manage the traffic, how do we maintain the skies safe. I don't call having a segregated area around a mall or around Starbucks and serving a couple of villages around it. I know that's profitable and that's being done and the costs are much lower. But when everybody's fantasizing about the pictures from the Fifth Element of taxis flying one over the other in Manhattan, And, through large scale operation over big cities and UTM U-Space, that's what, where I'm saying, this is not coming very short. And, the costs are high, are very high, be behind every flight. We'll talk about it soon. We made around 25,000 flights during this. Israeli National Drone Initiative. We'll talk about it. The costs are very high behind every flight, there is an ARA, an Airspace Risk Assessment. There is talking to multiple, government authorities. It takes a lot of time, a lot of people, there are people that are maintaining and, taking care of the computers in the USSP systems constantly because there are still bugs. So behind every flight, there are a lot of people and it's simply very expensive.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, it will be interesting if you could share some of the numbers on these cost drivers, because again, referencing Bobby's, recent episode, he was very open book about the costs being, currently,$4.27 per delivery, trending down towards,$3 by the end of the year. And they're not flying in segregated airspace. They're flying in controlled airspace. And you have multiple, delivery operators who are now flying in the same airspace under the Mode C veil in Dallas Fort Worth, for example, with MANNA and WING just recently showing how they are, coordinating their own internal UTM systems, or actually they're using an external partner. But that reality that you describe is really happening already. And with MANNA doing it profitably, don't you see that this is an early use case. Isn't that enough evidence?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">First of all, I'm a regulator, I'm CAA. I don't have deep knowledge, of the exact budgets that every stage is taking. Yes, the Dallas and the WING and MANNA cooperation, first of all, is something new. We all remember that we've been talking about UTM U Space at least for four years now. And only now, in the last couple of months, we see something, profitable. To my knowledge, they are the only one in the world that actually reached some sort of, of commercial profitability. I don't know of anywhere else it happened. I was at the Air Force for many years. And there are many ways you can count, one hour of flight of an F 15. Is it just the fuel and oil you replace? Is it the time the pilot was, instructed and qualified? Is it the maintenance that's after, I don't know, a hundred flights? So, don't know if they counted in the cost that it took to do the airspace risk assessment and the cost that people invested, the time that people invested in talking to, Dallas, to Dallas Airport, to, insurers to municipality, to the public, so I'm looking at everything to have one of our demonstrations. We still probably do have one demo, let's say every two months. So we're taking over a city, bringing there, let's say, 10 companies, now they're a bit less, but 10 operators to operate in the same city. And before such a week, we have 10 people, at least, just from the government, from the initiative management, working on it, I think, two full weeks. And, so I don't know if you measured just the electricity it costs to, charge the battery. and I'd love to hear, how it was done.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, you should check out the episode because, not to belabor the point, but, they do have a fully loaded figure that includes, variable cost and depreciation of the airplane, et cetera. But, what are those numbers like for the companies that you are working with in Israel? How much is their cost per flight?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I don't have exact numbers, Sometimes it's a simulated delivery. So the drone is flying from point A to B, but without the actual ice cream, hamburger, sushi, but$50 a flight. this, cause it's doing the actual flight and, we take over, an airspace over a city and we have, let's say, six, five locations spreaded in the city and drones are flying from point A to point B. They're being given, a destination that we're picking in advance. Which is, I don't know, two, three, five kilometers away from their departure point, going to that location and coming back. So this is what we've been doing. We have other missions that are not only deliveries, so we have cooperation with municipality, with the park So we did cooperation with the train, with the post office, with during COVID 19 pandemic. with the health administration. So, we had many profiles.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We're going to talk in a minute about your introduction to the Israeli, National Drone Initiative, but before we do, I'm sure there are people would like to know what's unique about the Israeli airspace? And then we're going to ask you about the INDI and, what it is, why it is, and the results you've seen so far.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">so, Israel is pretty small. Israel, if you Google the distances, so we're 470 kilometers long and 135 kilometers wide at the widest point. So, it's a very small country. I think, again, the square kilometers is around the 22, 000 square kilometers. However, we do have one of the largest air forces, at least in Europe, so either, even though Germany or France or the UK are 10 times larger than Israel, we have pretty much the same air force. You can, so you can imagine 600 aircraft squeezing in one aerospace. So it's small to begin with, we have a very large air force. It's very active. They're training a lot. Every pilot, in the Air Force does at least one flight a day, sometimes two. So the airspace is constantly, occupied. So these are first two things. Of course, we do have a very active, general aviation community and helicopters and light sport aviation, gliders, balloons, UAVs. We'll talk about that, in more in a second. So it's a very congested airspace. other thing is even before the war, it was a pretty threatened airspace. Everyone is very much on alert constantly for hostile drones. You can, see now that we're dealing with tens of drones a day, right now during the war. But even before that, we saw at least one attempt per month, even at what you call so called peace time. So everyone, is really on high alert from hostile drones. Theoretically, I know every country says they are on very high alert from hostile drones, but I think again, the volume here is obviously, much higher, I think we have many authorities with actual capabilities to deal with a hostile drone. And you have to make sure there will not be misidentification between a hostile drone and a friendly drone. So again, that's a bit different, because I think in many other countries, not every policeman, but not every senior cop has the ability to actually take down a drone. And in Israel, it's much more common. So, so the actual ability to deal with the drones is different. The last thing that most of Israeli airspace of that small airspace is not civilian, is not controlled by civilian unit. Most of the airspace is controlled by a military unit. The airspace are shared. So air aircraft, civilian aircraft can use military airspace, but the units that are controlling, are Air Force units. And, I'm a controller at Reserve Service at one of those units. Uh, and this is something unique, but we learned to use this sometimes as an advantage. So to make a lemonade out, out of this lemon, there are things that, civilian ATC, are pretty reluctant to do. and that's different with military ATC. So we take the advantage of each situation. So, so that's what's unique about the Israeli air space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So tell us a little bit about the, INDI background, use cases, participants, results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, around four years ago at the beginning of 2020, we were approached by, to our surprise, our highway authority. So, Ayalon, Highway Company, it's the equivalent of the highway authority and by, the innovation, authority they approached us, and we very soon, we set up a meeting with our director general. And basically, what they said, listen, us, the highway authority, have a mission to make the roads as clear as possible, to make the traffic flow. And we want to look at the possibility of removing small trucks and, scooters and making the roads a bit clearer and safer. Our innovation authority said we have the budgets, it's innovation, it's high tech. We have a budget. We want to start with a big initiative. We want to experiment, we want to try, we want to get our feet wet. Have companies fly over urban areas, let's say Tel Aviv and we will learn from this experience. You, the regulator will learn, which are the laws that, that you should do, which regulations you should change. Everyone would benefit. And to everyone's surprise, you can say, our Director General gave the thumbs up, and says, I'm good with that, Ayalon Highway Authority. You may take the lead. You have my green light. You have my people. That's me and my colleagues, Ami and Liron. Please help them with whatever they need. So this is how it started. And the basic structure says that us, the three authorities set up a tender. And we say in a one month, there will be a USpace and a UAS airspace over Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, just name a city in Israel, we've done it in that city. So there's going to be an airspace that we're going to experiment with deliveries. So, let's say for the first demonstrations for the first two years, about 10 operators, 10 drone companies, applied. Every company was checked and double checked by the innovation authority to see it's a valid, good company. And, you should fly every day, 50 missions, 50 flights will give you on every morning where you have to fly to, and everyone has to be connected, obviously, with the control center. So one of the, the bullets of that tender was also applying for, uh, USSPs, companies that will run the aerospace. And, we have two companies in Israel that joined right from the start, Airwayz and High Lander there. And they remained until now. We didn't have a third company joining so far. And this is how the structure was built and after a month, and that continued for 25 times, a headquarter or a control center is being built in that city. Airways and Highlander are two USSP companies sit together, connect their computers, set up the DSS, we'll talk about it. The companies equipped their drones with remote ID and we start flying. This is the basic structure. Besides those dedicated demos, I think the European term I like using is VLD, Very Large Scale Demonstration. So other than those something VLDs, we also used some opportunities we had outside of these organized demos. So when COVID 19 meant a complete lockdown of movement, actually, in Israel, curfews and so on, though we offered our services to different hospitals and the Ministry of Health to deliver, covid, samples, and to deliver, something to a building that's isolated. But we can land our drone on top of the, on the roof of that building in that hospital, drop the supplies that the nurse required, and that would save a nurse to dress up, dress down. It takes about 15 minutes. So that's one, way we did during the COVID-19, when there was a security situation in Beersheba. And we needed to scan the roads, help assisting the police to track down a suspect. We used to have a crisis in construction site with people falling down because they didn't, harness themselves correctly or they're doing their duties with no helmet. So we had a ad hoc cooperation, to see the, we can, control the safety in those sites. So, I can name a couple of other, corporations, but, the basic structure is the VLD and then jumping on different, opportunities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So Libby, I'm curious to understand a little bit more one of the first things that you mentioned, where your views, diverge from the rest of the industry, flight management versus conformance monitoring. Do you mind exploring that, thesis a little bit in more detail, including, arguments in favor of each.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, the four services that are mandatory according to, the European regulation, are four, they are network id, geo awareness, flight authorization. And the last one is traffic information. And this is, something that we dealt with, during the beginning of the war. I'm taking you to October 8th, okay? Or let's say October, 7th, noon, when everyone knows Israel is under attack. And we know that the war started with drones being sent from Gaza towards Israel, and there was a very big fear that, hostile drones are still, within Israeli airspace. Very soon, we pushed the 9/11 button. Everyone on the ground now, after a couple of, minutes, all the villages and all the, security managers of cities, of remote villages, of settlements, called us and say, listen, we have to fly our drones because this is the way we take care of the perimeter. We patrol the fence. So, you have to withdraw this restriction. So we have, and again, it's not only a fear from drones, it's a fear from terrorists that penetrated Israel. Eventually, what happened, and I'm cutting a long story short, we can get to that later if you wish, is that we declared the entire Israeli FIR as a demo or a semi U-space. That every settlement was allowed to fly in its own territory, only if they're connected to the USSP. Very fast, we, we built the control center. Have Airwayz and Highlander, our two USSPs, sit together, and we gave the possibility for each settlement to connect to either one of them, just as, theoretically you would, the European regulations sees that could happen eventually in a city. And it became clear to us that we are giving, actually four services, but not the ones that the regulation is referring to. So we're giving a network ID, obviously, no one was allowed to take off without, a network ID. The companies were giving these, operators geo awareness service. Before they would fly, they would file a flight authorization request. But, there was no need to, for traffic information service. There was a need, however, because everyone was flying within his own settlement. And many of these flights was anyway VLOS, because these were the guards having their drones within line of sight, doing their line in their territory. It doesn't have to be the full settlement, but their part that they were responsible in that fence. But it was very important to have a conformance monitoring because we wanted to make sure that if these were, on the border of being amateurs, these were not professionals, again, guards and volunteers for every settlement, for every village, including from my kibbutz where I live. Volunteer told the management here, listen, we have a drone we have good camera capability. I can guard this part of the fence from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM So many people volunteered and we wanted, it was very important for us to give them some sort of an alarm if they're doing something you're not supposed to do.. If they're getting away from the area that they are, they're allowed to operate. So conformance monitoring was very important. Traffic information was not so important. Now, when I try again to learn from this experience, and this is, getting close to what I was talking to in the first part of where people disagree with me, I think the average development of a shopping mall with one company serving the villages around him will happen much faster than 10 operators over Tel Aviv, a couple of, USSPs will give their traffic services. I don't think we'll reach that amount of traffic that will, it will make it profitable for everyone. I think we'll start in many places with one company giving services to the areas around it. And the services that are important are the ones I mentioned. The traffic information service is for a later stage. Even that, again, I'm in a couple of teams in Eurocontrol, in EASA. Including the ones, Andrew is so active at, and the way that traffic information service will be giving is questionable. Theoretically, the operator should get an information about a drone that is approaching him that is, not monitored or, a man crewed vehicle or, under the the, dynamic crewed, traffic. He's supposed to, take care of that. He's supposed to land, move his drone. There are many questions on how it'll be actually implemented and, I think it's a very good. philosophical or not discussion, but this is some part I'm, first of all, I'm imagining the development, the chronological development, as a certain direction. I might have it all wrong, but assuming this is the way evolution will go, I think the weight on each services will get clearer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's an interesting observation. And one thing that comes to mind is, if you're suggesting that there will be one operator per region serving a certain amount of airspace and the people underneath them, it becomes very difficult to then, arbitrate who will be that one provider in that area, right? Obviously as a government, you cannot say, no, we already have one operator in this area, so nobody else can come close in a way you're then promoting a monopoly in that particular area. So I don't think that's the way to go either. So at some point, the market forces will drive operators into a certain area. And now the problem is, okay, let's say that we have more than one, does that create the need for traffic information service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>32:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. Definitely. I wish, and I truly hope that I'm wrong and that I would get a request from four companies or even two to start deliveries in Tel Aviv. And then I would say, okay, guys, how do you, manage the separation? So I really hope I'm wrong, but until that situation comes, I think we will see more and more situation when we have, deliveries by one company because no one else wants, you're very right. I truly wish that I will get a request just as we start with multiple operators to operate in a certain airspace. However, since I know the costs right now, at least in Israel, are very expensive and the service will be very expensive, I'm not sure it will happen. I was starting to say that I'm looking at many problems in my life, in aviation, let's say, from history. And I'm looking about, how expensive services and new technology started. And I'm looking at the helicopter, taxi services in New York. And when I was a kid, I looked at the helicopter and my dad told me, oh, this is so expensive. When you're old, it'll be cheap. It'll be a 10 helicopter. It didn't happen. so I hope this will happen much faster, but for now on, since this services are expensive, I don't see a very large market and so many customers, so I hope I'm wrong, but that's why I think we won't start off right from the beginning with multiple operators because of these costs. When the first company arrives, starts delivery, as soon as the second company arrives, that'll be a good point to tell, okay, and, and we can set that off from the first contract with the first company. Okay, guys, you knew this is gonna come. I told you that when another operator comes, you will have to find a solution for safety, and you will have to have someone to manage the airspace. Guess what? As the Europeans like to say it, an acceptable means of compliance would be a USSP. By the way, do we need at that point two USSPs? Maybe we need just one company to manage the airspace. So I'm talking about scalability and costs. I have a good fault in that we've been working very hard in Israel on how to, and I'm going to get to that right with that question. What are the bottlenecks? So we've been working extremely hard in Israel on making this work. So making two USSPs cooperate perfectly, having no bugs, having restricted areas going back and forth. Having the flight authorizations, whatever is needed, and, it is very hard. And now, or let's say, as I, you could say, grew up a little bit and learned the costs, I'm thinking we might have made a mistake and we might have focused not on the most important and urgent thing. We've been focusing very hard on making a couple of USSPs work together perfectly in a U-Space. And what I'm telling you now, how sometimes I view things, it doesn't correlate with that knowledge now. But I was the first one to promote working on cooperation between a couple of USSPs. And that brings me to a question. Having two USSPs, or three, or fifty, working together is extremely hard. It's extremely hard because of emotions that competitors have, and, you can, assume a perfect utopic world, but we're talking about people. And when two companies have to work together the atmosphere has to be good. And when it's bad, and he's not working according to criteria, no, that guy's not working according to criteria. And unlike other topics that I'm in charge of in the CAA, I'm not a coding expert, and I don't know all the algorithms on the ATSM by heart. And, so, so that is a major, bottleneck, having two companies cooperate, so that's one stage. And then there's the actual technical difficulties. There are hundreds of commands and hundreds of orders and code is switching from one place to another. And hundreds of questions arise. And to some of them, I would say even many of them, there is no one answer. And, we had to answer many questions. And, this was the second and third, bottlenecks. The actual technical difficulties of running such a complicated mission. And the third one is the criteria that is not yet existing. So these are three, bottlenecks, I would state that these are going to be a big headache for me when we start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so is it fair to say that most of the challenges are, a step beyond simply assembling the information of the traffic picture across the different operators, but the challenges are really in using that information, how to coordinate the flight operations and keep them deconflicted when you're dealing with competing operators. Is that what you're saying?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think so, and this is just looking internally. So having two companies cooperate. Having, two companies, both software, you could say, working, that's the, second issue. Answering questions that are not, or getting answers that are not in criteria, that'll be the third. and we haven't even started talking about, different issues that are coming from outside. So, police, so Air Force, and many other government authorities want to have a say and want to make you do something for their needs. So, just looking at the internal difficulties, these are the major problems I stated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The National Drone Initiative has been ongoing for a few years now. What are some of the biggest insights that came out of it? And I'm curious, how come after so many years, there is no regular commercial operations of drones.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">On a private or commercial area for one single company, we have a lot of drone activity. Drones have been flying in Israel for more than 50 years. I was working on the first AIP chapter that incorporated them into the Israeli airspace 15 years ago. The first AIP chapter, on routes corridors and training zones was published in Israeli AIP in 2010. So we have around 300 companies registered, 300 operators, and around I think 3,500 drones have a registration number, meaning they're doing commercial activity. It sounds, doesn't sound like a lot, but if you look at Israeli size, that we are only less than 10 million people. If you look at the scale, it's pretty okay. So a lot of companies are having very successful commercial activity in the drone industry. So we're looking at agriculture and we're looking at photography and different IR scans and security. You name it. I think Israel is pretty known for being rather advanced. And there are many, companies that are working very successfully. We think generally, we're looking at, uh, a formula that says 1, 10, 100. So one operator operating 10 drones doing 100 missions a day. We generally say, as a very generalized, formula, when we were at that point, then we can be profitable. If we have one guy operating one drone, again, we might have get, got the math wrong, but we don't think this is, profitable again for the average citizen. So that's why the main, areas that it is worthwhile is the areas that, that I mentioned that are for public. I don't like, you can say the police example, cause, cause that's a wholly, a totally different, ballgame. That's first responders, that's emergency, let's say getting a defibrillator, serum, and they have, again, looking at manned, crewed traffic, this has been like this for ages and there will be no difference in drones, if a police helicopter used to have priority, then the police drone will have priority, and the same goes for medical operations.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you see the same concept of separation minimums of the traffic for drones that we already have with helicopters and other aircraft operating in the airspace? Will they be kept apart by the same distance? Do you see it as being something different for drones and, what is the capacity of the airspace for these different drones to operate alongside each other based on that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we started off, with a very basic, number, you could say, before the initiative, the basic number for, BVLOS separations was a separation of, five miles from IFR flight 2000 feet. And from, in Israel we have what we call controlled VFR route, or in short term CVFR, controlled VFR, and from VFR routes we allowed five kilometers but still, 2000 feet. That's, with the very basic certification process and before, dedicated the risk assessment. So, this is how we started the initiative after, when we started with the first demos we knew each company went a very detailed certification process and testing of their specific drones. So after we did that process, then the basic separation, got down to 500 feet. And, it was still, five kilometers, but 500 feet, vertical separation from, VFR traffic and man, the crewed, VFR traffic. And this was, fair enough for the, these, demos by the way, between the drones themselves within a U-Space we experimented with 60 meters between one drone and another. The initial altitude for the, U-Space was, 400 feet. That was the initial, number and that's around 120 meters, so we thought, again, looking at the traffic volume, we actually need to have two drones passing at the same second one over the other. So we experiment a little bit with, two actual, levels. So one drone flying at 60 meters, the, the other at 120 meter, again, very soon we realize it's working. We have to work a lot and very hard and the cost of having one drone do 360 or hold for 15 seconds and letting the other one pass, it's just so much simpler, and the traffic volume doesn't really justify getting into all that very hard work. I do see a very, big difference from manned traffic and that eventually every drone, the USSP, that unit would know its specific characteristics. So if I know that the regulator authorized for Matrice 300 for a specific type of drone, that we know that it was proven to us the accuracy levels are 60 meters by 60 meters, and another drone is less accurate. The other drone is cheaper, and that's, we could prove, or someone could have proved to us, that drone's accuracy level is 100 by 100, then the USSP systems would be able to tailor a separation for each drone. And it's a very big issue if I was a controller and I would known 737 800s have this level of accuracy, Airbus 320 have that level of accuracy and so on and so forth. But when a computer is running the thing, then I have no big issue of having a tailor separation between each two sets of drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And if you get down to, 60 meters by 60 meters type of separation, even in work you're doing today, and that still strikes me as a high number, but even if you stay there versus what you might achieve in the coming years, to me that seems like that would minimize the impact on the other drones that are operating in the airspace is type of separation would leave a lot of capacity, in the airspace system for drones. Is that the right read, on this or do you see it a different way?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I see it, the same way exactly. I was at a webinar or, it was even, a, of a conference that I think the Spanish authorities, I believe, were investigating a much lower number. Just as you said, I don't think it's a realistic, number. the second issue I was coming to is the reference altitude. The how do we, make sure that the drone that took off from one place but lands on the other has the same reference altitude as a third drone that took off from a totally different place? And that's another thing that you could say is you, it's not only unique to Israel now, but GSS interferences. So GSS interferences are a big thing in Israel. I know not only in Israel, now entire Central Eastern Europe and many other areas. Unfortunately, conflicts are not only in Israel right now. When you take everything into account, I think 60 meters as just, as you said, is it, is an ambitious number to begin with, I'm not sure how quickly it will be absolutely necessary, and I if I have a better solution of separating traffic, if it means one drone will, slow down for 30 seconds, I prefer the easy and simple solution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As I understand the operations that you have trialed so far are mostly VLOS, correct?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, I would say, something between, a third or even a half were BVLOS.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What's involved in obtaining approvals to fly BVLOS?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm not in the, airworthiness department, so I'll have to have a assistant from my colleague, Ami, from, airworthiness and engineering. But again, it's not something, new, of course, beyond visual line of sight operations have been in Israel for many years. And it's not something new. I could say just one thing without getting into the technical specification of what it takes to take a BVLOS. First of all, it doesn't require detect and avoid. So, drones that were manufactured, Hermes 450, for example, they're manufactured in a factory next to, uh, which is in the north part of Israel. And then those, had to fly to test their engines to instruct a foreign, customer, their BVLOS. obviously, they're flying, in an unsegregated airspace with other traffic, but without detect and avoid. The second thing is that we required a very well trained operator that's very well, knowledgeable in IFR flights, in, different malfunctions, obviously communication problem, navigation problem, just almost as an IFR pilot. And I know we were approached many times being told, Hey guys, what's needed to fly a Hermes 450 from the north of Israel to the south part of Israel is different than what it takes to fly a Matrice 300 or an Autel, over the margins of Tel Aviv over a large central park. So, these are a couple of requirements.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, so IFR expertise is not really a factor if you want to fly a small UAS up and down the coast beyond visual line of sight. So, is the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority using a SORA like framework to try to assess air risk and ground risk and then based on that assigns a SAIL level and later approvals for operators. Would you describe that process as very much similar to a European process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, it does. Again, not in my department, it's Aerial Infrastructure Engineering. I get to the part of that assessment that involves the aerial infrastructure. Again, this has been going on, for more than 10 years in Israel, you might even say, 50 years in Israel, and I get, into the picture when we're looking at the aerial infrastructure. Do we get next to an ILS and next to a SID from Ben Gurion? From a VFR route, what we call the controlled VFR training zone, and so on and so forth. But generally, yes, we didn't invent anything new. We're following a European regulation. I think we have some combination with the FAA regulation. I know for sure with licensing, we're following part 107. And I think historically the Civil Aviation Authority was very well connected 15 years ago, much more to FAA regulations. And we have a couple of relics from that period, like licensing, but, we're following either European or FAA regulation very strictly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I see. And I'm curious about your comment about not requiring detect and avoid for some of these larger UAS BVLOS flights. Is that because the entire airspace is so very tightly controlled that, there's less emphasis on detect and avoid.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, that's because all the airspace is controlled by a military controllers that have, very good sometimes too, strict control on every vehicle, on every aircraft. That's why we don't rely on the eyes of, of the operator. We don't need the eyes of an operator on the vehicle itself. They do not share the airspace with VFR. So in VFR traffic, theoretically, there is no such thing as separation and as instructions of ATC, but we rely on visual flight rules. So I won't get a drone in those routes. I usually I rely on both pilots. Either one of them will have to see the other traffic. Even if one is delayed, the other one will catch it first.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So general aviation VFR flights can only happen in certain corridors in Israel?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">When it's a bit complicated, if it's unplanned and you just want to hop on your Cessna and take off, to train a little bit, then you can do it, yes, only on certain corridors and on certain training areas, normally close to the, the airports on weekdays. Weekends, it's a bit different. There's much more freedom for the civilian low aviation to go about, wherever they want. And even during weekdays, they always have the possibility to request a special, request. they ask these, they file these requests and hundreds a day, to do this or that activity. Sometimes it's authorized, sometimes it's not. Mainly because. the airspace is packed with the Air Force training or doing operational missions. So, it's kind of a special situation in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just out of curiosity, at what altitude does controlled airspace start?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's basically you could say from zero to 5, 000 feet, but looking at very basically, there are some sections it'll go to 10, 000 feet and some that'll go below 500 feet. And even, it's a topic for another podcast. Even the way the controllers are controlling VFR traffic is almost close to IFR. They are giving them very strict instructions and separation, and they are very worried if two Cessnas come in a converging junction. But 5, 000 feet is a fairly good number.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So considering all of these factors, airspace and otherwise, is Israel an attractive region for drone operators from other countries to come in and do business? How often does that happen?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, we started the initiative, and I think we got a little bit famous around the world just a couple of years ago, let's say three to two years ago. And a year ago, nine months ago, the war started, just as before the initiative, getting a operator to fly in a country and not his own there's a paperwork involved. If I were to come with an Israeli company and start doing business in the U. S., It's not so simple. I think that again, Israel is a very attractive, or let's say should be a very attractive place for foreign companies to come because we took all these lemons and made them into a lemonade. So the fact that most areas are not controlled by civilian ATC means that we have, to do the coordinations with the Air Force and they apply very good logic, they are not obliged to look at some of the separation laws that the conventional, the historical, separation laws that came from a certain history in a certain context that is not relevant today. So we can execute to some extent logics that we cannot, demonstrate with civilian ATC units, unions, you name it. Now, the second thing is that again, I think we, the Civil Aviation Authority, have demonstrated that we are pretty flexible and that we are very helpful, that we are very approachable. You don't have to take my word for it. You can ask people from the industry, but me, Ami from Airworthiness, Liron that works with me, the SWAT team that was established to take care of UTM U-space. We are really doing our best, and sometimes an operator, it's very important for them. They might give up some profits, they might look at different problems they have getting a responsive and active regulator is a very big bonus. Now, the last thing is that I think, like the famous song, if you made it in Manhattan, you can make it anywhere. Well, if you've flown in Israel, no one can tell you that, you can't cooperate with authorities. No one will tell you that you cannot fly in places that have a hostile drone threat. And no one can tell you, ah, you, you probably can't fly in congested airspace.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I like your analogy. If you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere, right? But you're not at scale, though. So even though people are operating in Israel, and you can say, well, if you could do it here, you could do it anywhere. But nothing's really at scale. Or am I missing something?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think, having, around 25, 000 flights, let's say half or third of them in BVLOS in four years, in 25 very large scale demonstrations over people, over, the most major cities in Israel, over Jerusalem, the most sensitive place on Earth. With the size of the Israeli airspace, I'd say we're at scale. I didn't hear of any other country that ran a demo or a project with 25, 000 flights. It's true that the market. in Israel has its limitations. We're 10 million people. Let's say the more, more attractive parts of Israel with the major, customers, that is the big cities, the major urban, areas. Let's say our half of it, so we're looking at 5, 4, 3 million people. And that's true. The market is not very large. I think we have our advantages. someone can grab the opportunity and if our advantages are exactly fit that this or that company that can make good use of it I think they will be very unique So again, I think our attractiveness is true. It's not size and the market, but it's the other considerations of, and other special factors in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, on a few different, dimensions, you've mentioned the impact of military drone operations in the airspace and how that shapes the scale up of commercial operations. Looking at what you've seen in the Israeli airspace relative to this, and then also what we're seeing from the growing use of drone operations in wars like Ukraine. And if we project ahead to the future, what do you see as the implications of all of that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We had, this question being slapped on our face on October 7th, and we had to answer it right away. So we had about 24 hours to understand that we are in a highly threatened, new state of Israel, a new situation, yet we also knew in order to save lives, we have to allow friendly drones to fly. So that question was thrown in our face pretty aggressively on October, 7th. And right away. By the way, it went, we made an emergency regulation. We went to the parliament. Our two, units, our two USSPs were licensed according to Israeli law. So it wasn't, something that, that went on, without thinking it went through the entire, legal process in Israel. And basically what we did right away is mandate a remote ID to every small drone that's taking off. We mandated, that either company, that the entire Israeli airspace would be covered by companies that knew that's their responsibility and that they would pick up any RID Signal that that shoots up in that airspace. By the way, we contacted very fast DJI to open up their, RID broadcast services and they did it pretty fast. They understood the situation. So basically every drone that people are buying right now is transmitting, broadcast, RID right now. So, so these are a couple of, the solutions we found right away. I can say, from my experience, also in my, as, as my, with my reserve hat on, even the way that the Israel has dealt with the drone issues, even within Israel is very different. You hear about a couple of drones a week entering the northern part of Israel But although there have been a hundreds and hundreds of attempts from Yemen and from Iraq to send drone to the south part of Israel, no one succeeded. I don't want to get too much military here but even within israel, there are parts that the solutions that were there work much better. And obviously there are places where the solutions are much harder. There's no one solution. And we will have to build on many small solutions and try to make an impact.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, you've gone through many successful years with the INDI.

What's going to be at scale and why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I, I'm in a bit of a disagreement with my colleagues, as you heard. I wish that I would have, in three years from now, At least two USSPs in all the cities of Israel. I hope the bigger ones, obviously more customers, more people will enjoy more to the public, all these USSPs will be coordinated with the different defense organizations in Israel. So the Air Force, the police, other security organizations will have that. Picture so every police officer could have two swipes on his iPad and see if the drone above his head in the middle of Tel Aviv is a friendly one or he should take it down. and that goes, to the unit, to the Air Force unit. I know we're focusing for very good reason on urban airspaces and how do we provide the services in urban airspaces, but I want cities to be connected. We've been having a lot of flights between U-Spaces, long distances. Vehicles with the eVTOL, you just have to have a wing and it's, and you can call it eVTOL, another multirotor. So, larger vehicles. We've had, the EHang vehicle, both the 216 the passenger version and the cargo version flying in Israel. So I would want to have, some sort of taxi service. It won't be cheap. that's what I think, But I'd want that to happen.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But that's unlikely to be at scale in a couple of years. Clearly what you're describing with the drones, for the police forces, for the security forces, that it's seamless, that probably will be at scale is what we're hearing. And I'm guessing there will be some kind of drone delivery services, whether it be for, coffee, hamburgers, or medical delivery. It sounds like that may be at scale based on the excellent lessons learned. My guess is a little bit from what I'm hearing, passenger carrying vehicles, probably not at high volume scale, right? In three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I absolutely agree. We have, stations outside the city, you can park your car and take a bus. So if I can for 10 kilometers, even less so, if, if I can have a, EHang for$100 a flight doing this, seven minute flight the next central station in that city, I'd be very happy. Just as you said, I think the operations that will be of scale are those that have some sort of public value. So, I think municipalities will be a good place. Heavily using drones. I think government offices, environmental, looking for, construction garbage that, that, truck drivers throwing their, the dump from their trucks at illegal places. So I think, a general public, usage will be, at scale. I know we've been in contact with many offices and municipalities, court authorities, of course, the health industry. So I think in three years from now for that, I can, I'm pretty positive, unlike what I said at the beginning, that there will be a very long time before I'll get my sushi with a drone. I think it's different with public use, and that I can bet.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I do want you to give two minutes to the USSP providers out there. Let's say governments who are going to be deploying the USSP's and service providers, commercial organizations that are part of this process. What advice would you give to people? It's not, you have a lot of practical experience with really complex airspaces. What advice would you give to countries or providers for USSPs?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The first advice is having a very good knowledge in aviation and in regulation. We had high tech companies, very smart people, but without previous knowledge in aviation, they're having a very hard time understanding the logic. Look, I have a perfect solution. Yes, it's not STM, mine is better. No, you don't get the picture of the way things work. So, so this is, one advice. The second, that's more for countries and organizations. Don't do anything alone. Get cooperation for, I would say, the ideal number is three to four organizations. More is too much, and doing everything on your own is too little. So I would say join hands with other government agencies, other government offices, and don't do everything that one organization leads the entire thing. it's a, I don't know, it's an obvious advice, but you have to get people that are really into it, that really love it. You have to find that guy in the right organization, in the air navigation service provider, in Regulator and have that SWAT team being set up. Be sure that these guys get the authorities, get the approvals, get backed up from their managers. that's true in, in, in many issues. You have to get the right people really enthusiastic about it. And again, having, personal, connection with everyone on board. So meeting a lot, understanding the other guy's problem, not making decisions on your own. For sure you don't understand the full picture of your partner. And you have to have ongoing, very good, relationship, personal, and only then you will get to a much more educated, decision and it will save you time, in the future for granted funding goes without saying again for every problem in the world. And get the regulator on board and making sure that he's giving some sort of flexibility and that he has the ability and the will to help you. If a regulator wants to help you, they have ways. Every regulator has its ways, so you just have to get him on board. These are the top advices for people just starting a national drone initiative.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">When you look around the world and you see drone operations, being conducted, where are you most impressed?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right now, Dallas. Obviously, Dallas is very impressive because that's commercial. We've seen a lot of activity around the world, But Dallas would be the first. I hear a lot, I think I hear most of the things that's going on in Europe, but from now on, I have to say, if you're looking at actual flights and actual activity, it's low scale I'm, again, I have the pride to say we've done a lot of activity in Israel, I didn't see anyone get near that. Ireland, a lot of good things are going on in Ireland, thing that's really impressive in Europe is the regulation, the way they do regulation. We're very good, you could say, at practical experience. We, we hear of an idea and we run away and fly it. We want to experiment, to play with it, with our feet wet. That's one approach. The Europeans, I think, have a different, more strict approach, looking at the problem from one hand to the other, back and forth. And for me, with another approach, it's impressive to see the way they work. Very organized, very structured. And I'm impressed from that part in Europe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But the at scale operations in Dallas is a standout for you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, definitely,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What would you like to leave with our listeners? You've done a lot of years of very effective initiative here. What would you like to leave with our listeners that you think is unique based on your experiences?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think that you should get your feet wet. I think that the main advice I have. Maybe that's because it's a kind of an Israeli approach. It has some disadvantages, but I think staying too much time at the offices and drilling too deep into a third class, and remote scenarios in your risk assessment, it sometimes gets, not very effective, and I would suggest to put a limit on that and go out to the field and get your feet wet, get your feet wet, in not in the most, favorable environments. And this is where I come to Israel. I invite companies, first of all, to come see what's going on here without, without coming with your drones yet. But I do invite countries to learn from others experience. We have been very open and we invite everyone to come and witness with their own eyes, not the Zoom, not video calls, coming, meeting the companies, being in our, a control center, and then come fly, and because you're gonna hit that problems at one point or another. So start that early. I think the risk assessment can support that. Sure, you're taking a bit more risk that your drone might have a malfunction. But if you do it over an uninhabited area, then come on, start flying. Let's put up a USSP first in a remote area. Combine a couple of companies. experiment. that's my main, message. And the second one is come do it in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:10:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, great.

The viability of it has been proven very clearly. That this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think there has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space podcast and our conversation with Bobby Healy, CEO and Founder of Manna Drone Delivery. Bobby was a standout guest when we had him on the podcast back in March of 22, and we're delighted he could join us for a return visit today. Returning guests, give us such a cool perspective. They provide an update on the original assumptions and actual outcomes of the last two years. And with Bobby drone delivery overall, and more specifically Manna Drone Delivery, he reminds us of the original assumptions, what has actually occurred and what's been pleasant and disappointing surprises and how he sees the future and perhaps differently than his original assumptions. For those of who know Bobby and listen to his original conversation, you know he's a compelling, articulate industry veteran and accomplished aviation business professional. He's both a person who understands the technology and its application, and combines this with decades of aviation knowledge. And highly successful aviation technology implementation. This isn't always the case with some of the innovators and leaders in advanced air mobility. And it's perhaps one of the reasons more our app to bet on Bobby's projects and his vision for the future. And as we do with all guests, we listened to their important messages and we politely challenge their core underlying assumptions. And we've done the same with Bobby. Listen to what Bobby says is the killer app for drone delivery. Do you agree? He provides details with market size and price, which is refreshing. He talks about the value of B2C versus B2B in drone delivery. This in itself would make for a good podcast discussion as a lot of companies are focusing on B2B delivery. One of Bobby's essential messages is that the economics have now been proven for this space. Listen to his discussion of business and operational profitability. As we all know, getting to profitability is a challenge for any business. And it has been particularly challenging for some in advanced air mobility. Listen to how we discusses how Manna wants to power big and small brands directly. As an example, he has a deal with Coca Cola, where he flies their products. He discusses how he simply wants to replace the road and that consumers will and should never go back to road based delivery. If you listen carefully, you'll hear why Bobby has been more successful than others. I was a bit surprised by technology is actually deploying in house versus what others would hope he would purchase from outside technology providers. And finally listen to where Bobby believes advanced air mobility investments should be made beyond drone delivery. His answers may or may not surprise you. So many, thanks to Bobby for rejoining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our talk with Bobby Healy as you innovate and generate profits in The Vertical Space. Bobby kicked off his career building video games for Nintendo. He then founded Eland technologies an airline technology company, which he sold 12 years later to SITA. He then built Car Trawler the world's largest mobility marketplace for airlines over 15 years and led two successful LBOs for the business. For the last four years he's been building Manna a\"Drone Delivery as a Service\" business, whose mission is to improve the world by making lightning fast, suburban deliveries, affordable green and safe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, welcome back to The Vertical Space. We first spoke in March of 2022 and so we thought it would be great to bring you back and talk about the drone delivery industry and what has changed there, as well as what has changed with Manna. A lot of things have changed. So time to debunk some myths.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And it's great to be here again, guys. I'm really looking forward to it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Perfect. As you know, we typically ask if there's something that few in the industry agree with you on, would you amend your original answer or something else that's on your mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">If you look at my LinkedIn, you'll see that argument or the main arguments play out. Most people assume, not people in our industry, but generally people think that the use case is critical products, medical, defibrillators, urgent, societally beneficial products, and they are great use cases for sure. But the economic reality is that coffee and takeaway food is the killer app for what we do. That's one thing that most people, they don't disagree, they're just uninformed. They haven't done the work or the research that we've done on where the market opportunity is. And then the second one kind of hand in hand with that is a lot of people believe again, incorrectly that the unit economics or the capital economics don't work right now that they will at some point in the future when some magical technology comes along to make them work. But that's where I find, I enjoy myself the most on LinkedIn answering some of the people that have, raised those questions because I mean, I have the data, we have the flights, we're operating with profitable economics now. And I do enjoy engaging with people on the many misconceptions that are in our industry. And thankfully, we've already debunked them, not in theory or research. We're actually flying the debunk, even today as we speak we're flying aircraft in Dublin that are running profitable unit economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I would add that even when we talk to industry insiders, there is a tendency to think that B2B delivery use cases will be the ones that scale first, or at least if you asked them a couple years ago. There was a general tendency to believe that urgent cargo, high value not necessarily high volume movement will be the one that gains traction initially, especially because of the, arguably easier safety case to build with predetermined points in the network, as opposed to ad hoc, don't really know where the next order will come up, low value, you know, how in the world can you make money, delivering coffee and meals, et cetera, et cetera. Yet, as we often discuss on the podcast, those use cases didn't really scale past POCs and pilots, globally, whereas the, B2C delivery, the kind that Manna is doing is really starting to show some interesting inflection.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I agree. In the end we're running an infrastructure and that infrastructure is an airline. It's a cargo airline. And just like any other airline, utilization is a key factor in the profitability of that airline. And every airline in the world talks about load factor or utilization in our world. And you don't get that with high priority, critical goods, the volume just isn't there. So there's no world where you can make, those critical medical type deliveries a very interesting business from a commercial standpoint. And the other thing is you don't learn anything by doing that. Other than building an aircraft, you don't really learn anything. The real learning in serving the space we serve is in being in the trenches doing five, six hundred, a thousand deliveries a day out of a small car park and getting a 30 second turnaround time and embedding that learning into the software, into the hardware and iterating through that. So unfortunately, and there's a number of great players in our space that are doing and have done a really good job, pioneering job, I would say in medical delivery, but it doesn't translate in any way whatsoever to suburban, backyard, high throughput delivery. it's just two totally different paradigms and two different things to optimize.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Some of the guests we've had on have sometimes mentioned coffee delivery in a trivial way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Disparaging way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. And so, so when, as you're saying, listen, it's a, is it a good start for you? Is it a good proving ground for you? But can you scale and meet your financial projections that you want to hit in the next three years, delivering coffee?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already, every single coffee delivery we do is profitable. So 100 percent of them now, like we used to be at the weekends because we'd have higher utilization and then, weekdays were less so, but now our volume has diluted the fixed cost per location so they are profitable. And the thing about coffee is there isn't a product as popular on the planet for adults on a daily basis that has the adoption rate and the frequency and the gross margin that works so well that where the benefits of flying in a straight line as we do underwrite the new mode of delivering these products. So in a world where there's no such thing really as coffee delivery and people are now, I mean, you know, Starbucks or Starbucks drive thru is an example of Starbucks mobile app, people are absolutely addicted to, I would say, high consumption patterns, high frequency purchasing coffee. So of course it's going to be the best product. But now you say, people do trivialize it. Yes, only because I think not from a business sense, they're not saying coffee isn't a great product, but they're really saying, I think, is using the airspace to deliver a coffee seems like a bad idea to me. That's really what they're saying without saying it. And that's the purpose of I think regulation and the standards like Part 108 or in our case, U-Space in Europe, standards that are scalable that do allow high throughput in that airspace below 500 feet. And when we look at the market size we estimate that today there's 5. 2 billion food deliveries a year from the top four aggregators annually growing at 15%. So think DoorDash Uber eats all the way down and that's with a constrained market where there's a labor shortage, there's labor costs, economics problems, and there's a quality issue. So, so therefore those 5. 2 billion orders, road based orders are coming from customers that want it come hell or high water. Even if it's a bad customer experience and it's expensive. And the U S customer is paying nearly a 60 percent premium on basket value to get that pizza delivered. And they're never happy with it, but look, 5. 2 billion orders. So that's the current market. Our estimate puts it at a 16 billion order market without even trying, if we can remove the road from the equation and use aircraft. So you tell me one industry where you have probably a hundred billion dollar market staring at you in the face that's untapped, where the technology has proven we've already got positive uni economics. And the only thing between us and that giant market, I guess there's a social acceptance thing. You can't go too fast, too quickly. There's some regulatory, things still to unlock. But if you side that up beside blood delivery or vaccine delivery or whatever, it just dwarfs that space. And we didn't want to take on something easy. We wanted to take on the most impactful, space and that is everyday goods to everyday people in every suburban house on the planet profitably. And we're at the start of that now.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The other thing that strikes me about the coffee and the last mile consumer delivery is that you have the opportunity for a very consistent operation in order to make deliveries into all those customers in the market. By and large, they're already accustomed to ordering things from their phone from the ground based delivery aggregators. And in contrast, when we went and looked into the B2B medical delivery space, at least in the developed world, the companies face a pretty involved enterprise integration and organizational integration for each customer or each segment of customers. How is that flight operation going to work? Who is going to have the authority to initiate a flight? All of it ends up being a pretty heavy front load, cost and integration and it's heterogeneous operations as the business grows. Whereas in this it seems you already have a foundation of educated consumers accustomed to receiving deliveries via phone operations and it lays the groundwork for a reasonable path to go and scale a company to go and address that market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and there's no, enterprise sales process or there's no finding a budget somewhere in some hospital or some company's budget to try and do this innovative new mode. Our customers are the ones that are drinking the coffee. And they're abundant and they're aware of us and it's viral and all of these tailwinds to what we're doing that don't exist in the enterprise market. And then the other thing is we, again, we look at different densities. So European population density is much higher than US population density in suburbs. So for example, in Europe, we use a lot of motorbikes to move blood around between hospital critical to beat the traffic and it's very hard to justify, you know, why would you spend a large infrastructure budget and drones when the motorbike network's already there, largely run by volunteers. it's just sometimes forcing technology into a place where technology doesn't belong. Now different in Africa or, you know, countries that don't have transport infrastructure anyway. And of course there, you're not providing drone delivery. You're providing transport infrastructure. But there's already solid transport modes in most modern economies that are not as good as drone delivery, but they're not far off. So your benefits are marginal. And then you're incurring, as you said rightly, all this overhead of cold chain of all the trail of every part of the process for that sample or whatever it is. And then of course, toxic substances. a lot of the products you might want to fly in medical areas are considered hazardous substances, so, chemotherapy drugs is a great use case, but you're into a whole other area of risk there. And we just said, look, there's parts of that prize that we're interested in and we also liked the fact that it's a critical need to deliver those products, but at the same time, it comes with just such difficult challenges on the economic side of things that from my view, it's always going to be a business that's subsidized by something. And that's, I think, why it succeeded so well in Africa to date. And I think honestly, it's going to be challenged in other markets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I may say something really quickly, we can move on from this. As it relates to medical delivery, and in clinical pathology versus anatomic pathology, so blood versus tissue, I think an argument could be made that there's high volume of both, and tissue pathology will have a much higher critical factor, and there'll be a lot of price behind that, because there's a sensitivity to it where that may be a good market. I think they're both relatively high volume, but one difference between a cup of coffee is that the economics may not play out unless there's a lot of volume in the delivery. They're not going to pay a lot for one piece of blood, and I think one thing we discovered, Luka and Peter, on one of our podcasts was what's the real value of getting it there a little bit faster when it's a 24 hour turn on the testing anyway? But my sense is that the, and Bobby, in hospitals, labs, there's a very large cost item set aside for courier.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's a big element for labs. So maybe that's a next stage for you if the economics play out, but that meets a lot of your criteria, conceivably clinical and anatomic pathology, maybe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. I mean, I'd love to be, I'm not sure I'll be proven wrong here. What I'm, I guess in the end, what I'm saying is if you're going to build an infrastructure then you underwrite the cost of an infrastructure with a viable business case, and then all the other applications can work on top of that. So if you're already in a city or a suburb or whatever it is, and you're flying trivial products, albeit you're making money doing it, why wouldn't you then deploy that for other use cases? It could be beer. It could be medicine, like you say, samples, all of these things. And we can pick products up as well as drop them off. And why wouldn't you deploy? Of course you would. But you don't start with that because you're always going to be building a business that needs to be subsidized by something. And again, it comes back to ambition and scale. And for us, the ambition is unlimited. And we say, what is the biggest use case that we can solve? And it is, no matter what you say. It's always going to be the suburban household and their needs. And that's going to be what will underwrite the infrastructure for any successful player in this space. It ain't going to be medical.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>19:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, you talk about the potential to expand the market from what 5. 2 billion deliveries per year today with the ground based aggregators to something much larger. When you look at the differences that drone delivery brings into the equation, whether it's speed or environmental advantages or a safety case or cost, what do you see as being the key drivers that are creating the behavior change that leads you to think that there's a 16 billion a year, delivery opportunity?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">There's existing numbers that show adoption rates of road based delivery between 4 and 5% around the world and they kind of point to a low take up rate and there's our own data as well. and there's different states. I think that the restaurants are a small business. Think the consumer at the end of it all. And you look at the different things that they think are important. And in the case of the restaurant, restaurants frequently, they just can't, they can't get delivery, right? It's just too expensive. They can't do it themselves. The aggregators that power them, the, DoorDashes and Ubers and so on, that power them and themselves are constrained with output as well, if it rains, if the weather's bad in any way, or if it's peak time, you just can't meet the demand peaks, with people, it just doesn't work. So the result is batching, where multiple orders are put in with one driver and therefore cold food or terrible quality food and unpredictable times. And that's reflected in the NPS or the ratings of all of the aggregators, which are on the floor, not because they're not great businesses. They are, but they're constrained by just a limited output that they have. So why are we different? Because we're point to point. our average flight time is just less than three minutes. Physics is on our side. And when you have that advantage, the outcome is look, it's literally as simple as the outcome is hot food or hot coffee or, and in good condition. And that is remarkably the most important thing. It isn't speed. It will speed kind of translates into quality, but also reliability and predictability, which is as important as quality. People are willing to wait 15 minutes or 20 minutes. They are willing so long as that's what it is. But with batching and traveling, the traveling salesman algorithm, there's no way to be sure about that. So, so the variability is very poor. And so the consumer is going to modify their behavior because of drone delivery and the advantages it has. And we already see that in something as simple as coffee delivery. And before we existed, there was no such thing as coffee delivery in suburbs. That nobody would be crazy enough to do that because you won't make any money but yet our basket value in our coffee shop is more than twice the the basket value of the average order in the coffee shop itself, because behavior, right? It's a household order. So it's 2. 3 beverages per basket. There's a bunch of pastries and so on and then the other stakeholder for us, as I said, the vendor, the small business, they're looking at this saying they're now able to reach a couple of hundred thousand up to half a million customers in their catchment area of less than a five minute flight. And they're saying this is massive for their business. So. That's another stakeholder. And then the final stakeholder for us is the aggregator itself. And we'd expect our business is going to be, we call it B2B. And what we mean by B2B is we just want to be a delivery company. So we want to power the aggregators. We want to power the big brands. We have a deal with Coca Cola where we fly their products, but we want to power all of the big and the small brands directly, simply replacing the road. And so you think about the aggregators and their numbers are public. The aggregators lose money on most of their orders in suburbs because of the time it takes to deliver them and the labor costs and the labor laws. So we know the benefits to them are actually simply unit economics. we can do a delivery for them cheaper than they can do it themselves quite simply, and still make a strong margin ourselves because of our operating economics. So there's different stakeholders, but it, and some of them, it's about economics and some of them it's about experience and quality, and some of it, it's about growing the market. And by the way, the five to 16 primarily comes from number one is actually just widening the addressable market. So you're going from where the aggregators really only want to do very dense areas and quite short trips to obviously optimize their costs. We can now do much longer trips and support much less population dense areas. So you're actually widening the market to those like 92 million detached single family homes in the USA. And similarly in Europe, there's these really fragmented towns, suburb cities that aren't that easy to address for the traditional mode. So it's a combination of just customer behavior, I think, and market addressability.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, you answered the question, but I was going to ask if there are categories of products that people just wouldn't consider ordering via ground based delivery because they just know it's going to take too long, like a latte or something. And are you seeing that people will order those products given their expectation that it will arrive faster via a drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, we survey them as well. And quite interesting. If you look at lots of publicly available data, the key categories for road based delivery are, in order, if I just pick one market, the UK, where there's great data. And it's quite similar in the USA as well, but there's the top one is pizza. And then it's, other products like Indian or Chinese and burgers and fries is like fourth or fifth in the list of, perishable prepared meals. But actually if you ask people what they want to eat, burgers and fries is the number one thing. So what's going on there is people already know that certain products just don't deliver well, they don't travel well, and anyone that's got a road based delivery of burgers and fries knows that after 20 minutes, it's just toxic. So, so therefore you can't reheat it either. So, so consumers know not to order these things. So in the existing road based data, there's a hidden demand that's there that's not satisfied. We know that already from ours. And our number one, outside of coffee, our second one is probably tied between burgers and fries and ice cream. And an ice cream is an interesting one because you don't need a lot of choice in ice cream, right? You just need a quality, well known brand or two for the customer. But ice cream is interesting because it's 168 hours of the week almost, it's almost flat by hour of day of week. And it's driven by family orders, right? These are orders that have an experience associated with them, like a party or watching a movie or things like that. And the alternative is getting your car for 35 or 40 minutes to get the ice cream if you don't happen to have it. So we do see people now starting to rely on us for certain categories like coffee and ice cream that they might've pre purchased a week at a time and stored it in their fridge before, and now they just don't care cause they can get it from us and then the really the alarm bells, I think in a good way that ring for us is that burgers and fries in terms of meals are number one category. And finally, I would say people are saying, finally, I can get French fries. It actually tastes like French fries and they arrive. And I know that sounds trivial, but it isn't. It's the flagship product of McDonald's, right? I mean, French fries. I started this business because I wanted a bag of French fries and we call them chips in Ireland. I joke about it, but I did. And it's one of those, highly sought after products that delivery just fails.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>27:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I mean, Uber is a great case study in how an addressable market can expand when you introduce a new capability or a new user experience. I don't have the data to back this up, but I'm just basing this on my own consumption patterns and those close to me, but I'd be comfortable saying that a lot of Uber users their budgets for taxi and black cars prior to Uber were not the same as their Uber budgets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And the amount of music people consume now, it's Spotify. there's things that consumers never would have told you they wanted until you gave it to them and then they're absolutely reliant on it. It's like air and we'll be the same. We already are in the towns we operate in. It's just, people are blown away by the fact that they can get our service but at the same time, they straight away adjust to it and they start to get angry with us if we're 60 seconds late it almost feels like for some of them. So, so, and that's a good thing. it really is the end of road based delivery. When you offer this service, consumers never going back to road based delivery. And I think that's not unexpected. Our job has been at the engineering level to make sure that no matter what the weather is, they wouldn't need to go back. So that means flying in minus 20 C plus 42 C, very strong winds, I think 35 mile an hour winds, things like that, rain, obviously snow. And if you don't do all of those things and really from an engineering point of view, harden the product, you don't have a business. There's no point being a drone delivery business for fair weather because the restaurants and the customers that you're powering, they'll just, they just, if you, if they can't trust that you're going to always be there, you're a novelty, you're the circus. And that's not who we want to be. So you have to start with the very hardest of solutions and an engineer for that. And when I think about what advice I would give people, you can't start in this business with a halfway house. You have to have the final, picture solved. That's a mistake we nearly made at the start. And just by sheer luck, we happen to be in Ireland, which is the worst country in the world to do a drone delivery business, permanently raining, permanently windy. So therefore we can fly in any weather, but it comes back to, and it's very important. I know it sounds like engineering, but I'm trying not to be too engineering about this. But if you want to be real in drone delivery you have to replace the car fully. You can't be partial replacement. And that makes it much more difficult. The engineering equation is just much harder and the testing equation is much harder. Even the delivery mode, the way we deliver the software we've written for that arrival at the house and delivering, it looks simple. but it's not, it's quite the opposite. And then testing that out in the wild and, is one thing in a big field in the middle of nowhere, but testing it where there's customers underneath you, is a whole other thing. And that takes so much time. Sorry, I'm wondering, but it goes to what do you need to solve for, right? You need to solve for predictability, availability, speed equals quality, cost, unit cost, and yeah. So safety, I don't even talk about safety because you don't have a right to exist, if you're not safe and that comes down to, yes, we have governance because we're regulated by aviation regulators and a lot of oversight comes from that. But. It doesn't make you safe. There's a million ways to still not be safe, even if you're regulated. I think that comes from, there's a, there's an existential threat hanging over the industry if it's irresponsible when it starts to scale. And what that translates to, It took us five years and I don't think you're going to do much quicker than that. And when you start developing a backyard delivery product to, to really scaling it, which is where we are now, it's somewhere between three to five years timeline. And no amount of fantastic engineering, or engineers speed that up. It's a process of gradually evolving, crawl, walk, run more and more volume. You can't please the investors with this one. You have to manage them and let them know that it's a long, arduous process to make sure that you're safe. And I certainly see that in the industry, we've done a great job at that. I don't see anyone pretending that it can go, at blitz scaling pace, but it will, and I think there's a number of, operators like ourselves, like Wing, for example, Google's program that are now ready to start some really, serious growth in a safe way. So, but it is not your typical industry where a five year path normally to a startup, building a viable product with viable economics and the start of a revenue journey. That's very difficult, space by any measure. And so it'll come to what's the market look like in, in a decade, who'll be there, how many will be there, that kind of thing. Just because you mentioned the word safety, what it translates to is a market that's going to be a very few number of players with sufficient deep pockets and patience to get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, Bobby, delving into the customer experience a little bit more. Are you, guiding customers towards expectations for how long it will take for different categories of products to arrive from the time that they push order on their phone? What is a reasonable expectation for a latte versus a hamburger and fries versus other takeout food. Obviously the drone delivery operation itself is a consistent time period, but the preparation time and the other\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">what should customers be expecting?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. There's a very difficult problem to solve actually and the big aggregators have, have done the best job at this simply because of time and the data that they have. Truth is a restaurant that's preparing meals is a very unpredictable output line, particularly smaller ones. And from a day to day or hour to hour basis, quite difficult to predict. Now there's some very large brand players. I don't need to name names, you know, they are, but they can produce a meal every 20 seconds and they can get one through their drive through every 35 seconds. And so for those types of brands, we can tell the customer down to the minute when they can expect to see their nuggets or their fries or whatever it is land in their back garden, essentially for the others, and we have a number of vendors that are, they're a super product, but they're erratic to say the least. So we tell the customer it's a three minute flight or a two minute flight or whatever it is based on the range and the wind. And then we say, and the prep time for this restaurant is between five minutes and you know, with Google flights, you get this kind of bar chart of likely we give them a bar chart of likely arrival times based on the vendor's prep time. And we tell them what's happening as well. So they know in our app or through our API with our B2B partners, they know when the vendor started to prepare, they know when the vendors finished preparing, they know when we've received the goods from the vendor. They know when it's been loaded onto the aircraft. They know when the aircraft's taken off and then they can track it in real time. So the reason we do all of those things is the customer can always see progression and that's important. So the customer does not mind waiting 15 minutes 20 minutes for their burgers and fries, so long as you keep them updated on that progress. And so we measure time by stages, but if I look at my order to arrival time. So it's a time the customer pressed the purchase button to the arrival time. We see a range for products like our Coca Cola delivery, the median time for the aircraft to take off after the order is two minutes. Flight time is three minutes. So, so median time about five minutes all the way up to the premium, we've got this French guy that makes these, delicious sandwiches, but he takes 20 minutes to make the sandwich, but again, it isn't about the actual time. It's about the confidence in that time. And look, our NPS, our net promoter score is 86 year to date. And that's because we have this obvious advantage that we fly, but also we manage, as you say, the customer expectations very clearly. through constant messaging of progression of their\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay. So as you scale and demand increases, how do you keep customer expectations realistic? If it's coming up on lunchtime and you get a bunch of, order interest coming in and you have only so much, delivery capacity during that hour and that, beyond a certain amount, deliveries are going to be delayed simply because you're waiting for a free drone to go and make that flight. How do you prevent customer disappointment with the experience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And we have an advantage there over road as well, because we know if we look forward at the next 60 minutes and we calculate capacity in the next 60 minutes for any given GPS points, we know pretty accurately how many orders we can handle for the next 60 minutes. And that's the window where, it's actually between 30 and 60 minutes where a customer will say, I'm not willing to wait that long. I'll drive myself or I'll do without. So the first and foremost, there's no point adding capacity blindly if you don't know how to assess it in real time. So the way we look at it is we continually add capacity in units, as our repeat cohort of customers grows, so too does our volume, orders per hour, per day of week, and that's pretty easy to anticipate, and we just allocate extra capacity ahead of time. Overcapacity for us isn't such an issue when you look at the aircraft utilization, because we don't care so much about an aircraft sitting on the tarmac. We care about the people's cost, the people cost that would load that aircraft cargo, they're there anyway. So when we flex up and down capacity, it's more about flexing up and down the people that manage or load cargo or monitor those aircraft than the actual aircraft themselves.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the most utilization sensitive component of your operation is utilization of your human labor, not utilization of your airframes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Correct. Yeah, we don't really care about utilization of the airframes. I mean, we do, but in the end, don't forget we have mobile aircrafts. Our aircraft can load balance from one cell to the other. In other words, the aircraft can autonomously go from one location to another to serve demand in different locations. So we can dynamically allocate the fleet to. And there's other great use cases like parcel delivery, postal delivery, for example, and pharmacy delivery, even that you can take orders with a four hour window on them and just send them in underutilized slots. So we can balance our utilization through the day, particularly daytime hours. So I think as we grow, there'll be more of those what we call latent orders that have a window of delivery time that don't need instant delivery that we will use our fleets to fly. So I'm not too concerned about the aircraft itself. It's the people and we have two modes of operation. We have one where we're highly centralized, all the aircraft and a handful of people. And also, for example, one of our people can load between 20 and 30 flights per hour. So that's our number, right? and 20 or 30 flights per hour is the best you're going to do because our turnaround time is between 30 and 60 seconds, right? Aircraft landing, aircraft taking off and that you can't beat that. No, there's no way to beat that number. But that's the cost, right? That's that person's cost for those 20 or 30 deliveries. And you want them fully utilized. So if you're over budgeted on those people, then you're going to increase your cost per delivery. So that's the way to think about it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, what's been the biggest change in the drone delivery market in the last two years since we talked?

And like I said, I always, I'm not a great mathematician, but if you scale a negative number, you get a larger negative number, no matter how hard you try. no, look, we already have$4 in and around sometimes less, sometimes more dependent time of the week and the cargo cost per delivery fully loaded. Right. That's, and we're going to, by the way, publish this data, both on LinkedIn and through our friends at McKinsey. And so you'll see it and, but you can also see a very clear path to$2 cost for delivery, like literally with our eyes closed, we won't get there at the end of this year. We won't be far off it, but even limited scaling will bring us to a$2 cost per delivery. And what we want to win at is that, going back to the Warren Buffett, right, in a commodity world and drone delivery, ultimately, at scale and over 20 years commodity, right, it's A to B safely and quickly. The winner will be the ones that have the best cost of operation. This is why Ryanair succeeded, is why Southwest did so well in the earlier days. And we learned from history of running businesses that it's not the coolest product that's going to win in this space. Nobody cares. it's about the cost. So, so what's changed, I think we've demonstrated in superb fashion that the industry is viable, economically viable, and I think that's important. And then I think regulatory wise, again, we now fly BVLOS all over Europe. We have license all over Europe. Europe has really strong, difficult, but really clear regulations. USA has moved forward at pace as well. We see pretty much everyone operating with 135s, we see Google really starting to expand their operations, we see major brands like Walmart really leaning into it, so I would say ahead of expectations in Europe, for sure, and what we would have predicted in the USA as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What about a disappointment, Bobby?

I would love to see, and we would love to be flying under 108, very soon, but, still uncertain and uncertainty kills an industry like ours, well, it doesn't kill it, but it just makes it very difficult for companies like us to continue to grow and raise money to grow when there's uncertainty around the regulatory environment. And so 108's a discipline. Well, it's not a disappointment. It's great. We love it. It's the right shape. It feels exactly what the industry needs to scale. It's just hard to say when those, rules will be written and we'll go through the process and become, routine. So is it a disappointment? No, like I'm pretty happy that we have BVLOS in Europe. There's, 500 million people here, 300 million of which we can reach. so there's plenty of business. And I would say to any drone delivery company. get over here and start flying. Like Google are flying a mile away from my house here, where I'm recording this from, Europe is a fantastic place to build some scale. It's not as great a market the USA, it's a market where you can really get flying anyway. So, so disappointments, they're not really disappointments. They're just, it's the, I just wish it could all move a little bit more quickly in the USA. and other than that, I think we're in really strong shape.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How should we make sense of the different operating cost numbers that we see in the industry media or being talked about across the different companies that are doing this? From your vantage point, do you know if they're all being formulated the same way? Are we talking about apples to apples or apples to oranges with these numbers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think, there's some wishful thinking in some of the things that I've, seen. I would say, remembering WeWork and community adjusted EBITDA is the phrase I would think of here. You have to include packaging cost, battery motor depreciation, prop depreciation, maintenance, aircraft depreciation, personnel, all of the other costs, but those are the main ones that I listed there. If all of those aren't in your unit economics there's already a problem and particularly aircraft depreciation. So again, that goes to our aircraft has a useful life of 75, 000 deliveries. And that means that our depreciation factor is relatively low. And that's an intentional part of our product design, even battery management, battery maintenance, those ones should be equal for everybody, right, because we're all using lithium ion in some way. And we're charging them at different speeds, discharging them at different speeds, but largely speaking, while we think we're better than most on battery, I think you could pretty much assume that everyone's the same in that regard. I think where all of the players differ greatly is in longevity of the aircraft, how many cycles you're going to get from the aircraft. It's throughput per hour. And that comes to hot swap architecture or not hot swap and then charging in situ kind of the opposite of hot swap. Charging in situ means that your battery won't last as long. And after the person loading the cargo, battery is your biggest unit cost. And what I mean by that is if you're charging a battery in sub zero temperatures, or if you're charging a battery in very high temperatures, it's not going to live as long as a battery that's charged at a consistent temperature indoors. And that comes down to aircraft architecture and operational architecture. In other words, hot swap battery, the battery's only outdoors for 60 seconds before it flies. We've thought about all of that and we've thought about it because of our focus on unit costs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so you're treating batteries and motors as consumables. Those are not going 75, 000 flights. Those are being replaced periodically, but it's the remainder of the aircraft that you assert has a 75, 000 flight life. Okay, so how many flight hours, just from an aviation standpoint, comparing the expected life of this aircraft in terms of flight hours? How many is that? Roughly 15, 000 flight hours?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's a divide by eight, divide by eight. We do eight flights an\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">hour So what is the remainder of that airframe? What data do you have that, gives you confidence that this is a 75, 000 flight item? And what's your approach to continued airworthiness and maintenance of that object over that time?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Data. So our old aircraft, we call it the 3.8, was a 20, 000 flights aircraft. And we've never written one off before that, but we have many of them that have done more than that. We've a couple of aircraft over 20, 000, 25, 000 flights each. So we have formed there. We know what are the things to engineer for. When you talk about our newer aircraft, which we call 3.8.4 really it's functionally no different than our old aircraft, except for the propulsion system, which is a, it's a much easier maintenance system because most of the failures in our previous aircraft came down to wear and tear during maintenance, during routine changes of parts of the subsystem, props or, motors. So our new aircraft airframe, a single piece of carbon fiber, no moving parts. And that is easy to cycle, right? It's very easy to cycle that airframe through actually half a million flight cycles, on simulator on test benches, should I say, and get the data. And that's the process for evaluating what the lifetime of each component is. You're right, our motors and our batteries and props actually, for that matter, are in our unit cost. So we write off motors after 2000 hours. We write off batteries, in a number of flights, a number of cycles. So it's very predictable. And props less predictable although there's expected lifetime for props, it's mostly, preemptive, I would say monitoring for imperfections or damage to props and changing, but it's stack ranked it's battery, motor, props. And then we apply just a consistent percentage overhead to the entire bill of materials on the aircraft outside of that annual cost, which is quite conservative to get the look, this cable failed or that, that LIDAR unit failed or whatever, because components fail individually and in very unpredictable ways. And so I think the right approach there is just apply a consistent proportion of the overall bill of materials in an annual tax almost in form of maintenance and component switching. And we're, we've been in this five years, we think we have very good data on that. So we're, and as I said, we're quite conservative on it, but it's still overall the depreciation of the entire system for per flight is quite low. It's certainly lower than the person loading the cargo. And then continued airworthiness or maintenance and, the traditional aviation part of things, I would say our old aircraft or existing aircraft depending on what you're day you're operating on, is an aircraft that required a lot of overhead, a lot of maintenance inspections, frequent inspections, frequent overhauls. And we moved now to our new aircraft that just self diagnoses everything, designed for high throughput, long time without even an inspection. But it still backs down to very traditional aviation practices for keeping aircraft in the air and ensuring that they're safe. We, I don't think we're any different there than company that flies small planes or helicopters in the processes, the training, all that stuff that happens.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Given that you'll be publishing some numbers soon, are you comfortable sharing with our audience some high level,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Of course I\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">major cost drivers and the specific\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I actually, I predicted you would ask me, so I actually got a breakdown. Yeah. Yeah. Are you ready? Well, why wouldn't I talk about this? Because we, we do the best, right? So, so today,$4.27 cost per delivery of which fixed overhead, 71 cents, labor$1.93 consumables and depreciation,$1.63. That's where we are today. And then by the end of this year, well, look, I don't want to promise too much, but that'll probably be closer to$3 than even$3.50. Yeah. And then if I look at the human costs, so, and this comes to our operation, which again will evolve. We have different roles. So we have what we call a dispatcher, which is what others would call a pilot, that's a person that for us can monitor up to 20 aircraft simultaneously. What role they have? I don't know, because there's no sticks. There's no control of our aircraft, but they're there anyway, monitoring, but our loaders is our biggest cost. So, so that those are people that just take cargo from a vendor, load on the aircraft, just over a dollar per delivery. That's interesting because Ireland, in fact, Europe is a high wage environment, and so our hourly cost for labor is about$18. so if you look at that and then you look at our future system, which does not need those loaders, so when I talk about going from$3 to$2, that loader for us goes away and the vendor loads the cargo. So we're not in a rush to do that. We have the system built, we're happy. But for now we want to operate just highly centralized, very well managed, location. So we have that loader cost. And the number of the$1.63 that I mentioned earlier on in consumables, I can tell you stack ranked in there it's battery is roughly 50 percent of that currently that'll come down a bit with new battery chemistry we have, and then motors is second at about 25% and then maintenance, just a fixed cost of maintenance per flight that we apply and props and replacement components is the remainder of it. And there are some benefits to scale purchasing of these were obviously tiny now in terms of scale of purchasing. So that$1.63 we predict at scale will come down to about 45 cents. And so when we get from$4.27, where we are now, down to$3 or say$2 and 2 cents is the number I'm looking at, the bulk of that comes from reducing our consumables cost by just scale and better purchasing power. And then there's a pretty significant, unlock for us in change of battery chemistry, so going to a more conservative battery chemistry, but one that has a higher number of cycles and that comes from, again, this, we see this as a major advantage that our system has is that we don't need to charge our batteries and anything over 1C. So we can charge them slowly because the aircraft isn't waiting for a charge with us, so we might have seven, eight, nine battery systems, cargo systems per aircraft, and one of them is flying while eight of them are charging, so we can charge them very slowly and therefore get many more cycles out of the battery. And that, that counts in this space. It really does count. The top level architecture we have, we think it is designed for throughput, of course, productivity of real estate space, but also it flows through that because we have this hotswap battery, our costs per delivery are quite a bit lower than I think for people that are charging in situ, but look, those are the numbers. And we're actually going to publish the whole thing in detail for everyone to look at, but there should be no surprises in there. And I think largely our lower cost is driven by our higher throughput per hour.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Are these contribution costs, Bobby, or what costs are not included?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So those are pretty much everything.

So don't forget our cost gets diluted by the number of drones, right? And then that's proportional to the utilization of that same number of drones. So if we've resourced it correctly, in terms of the human loaders, then you need a 55 percent utilization of that capacity to reach those numbers. Those are numbers that we deliver today based on our existing volume.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What does that translate in terms of, daily deliveries per aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we do all of that with less than 300 deliveries a day for our four aircraft.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But there are delivery surges, in the morning, at lunchtime, different parts of the day, and then there are low periods. Is that right?

So volume is what takes care of that, Peter. So you, you reduce. Or should I say you increase the granularity of utilization as volume grows, right? So we already see weekends, for example, we operate 12 hours a day. Weekends are, I wouldn't say I haven't looked last week, but they're north of 90 percent utilization now on weekends. And what we probably should do is add more aircraft and drive more demand, but we are not motivated by volume. We've never been motivated by volume for this stage of the business. We've been always motivated by those KPIs around cost per delivery and optimizing for that. So we're about to open two other bases in the same suburb. So we'll be bringing it up to the gigantic number of 12 aircraft, which doesn't sound like a lot to most folks, but that's a thousand deliveries a day for us, more than a thousand deliveries a day cause they're very productive aircraft. And if we're successful at getting that over time, if we fill that capacity, which we will, once we switch on certain new channels, but think probably across the week, it'll be anywhere from 400 to a thousand real deliveries a day in the suburb. you'll have always have that right, but we'll flex up and down the human resourcing part of that across those, days of the week and hours of the day. And we, we think a natural place to be is about 70 percent utilization and at 70 percent utilization, we're somewhere between 2 and 3 cost per delivery.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You already mentioned that this is all beyond visual line of sight, and that the loaders are the only people involved, so no visual observers. Can you talk about how the, mission execution is done with the supervisors and any progress on the 1:many front.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, for us BVLOS is one to many. And for us, that happened at a year ago where we went from many to one. So we had like two point, two point, whatever people per aircraft down to now, actually practically we think it's probably 20 to one because that person, that resource really doesn't have a role. There's no mission planning. There's no nothing that there's really no role for that person, but we're happy to have that person there anyway, to observe and just to be aware. And there's certain areas, like we fly in controlled airspace as well. And Europe has this thing called U-Space. And we've worked with the folks in Google and in Wing with this as well, about de confliction and then bringing that de confliction up a level to ADS B IN to avoid traditional aircraft. Today, we do all in an automated way, but we'd also use that observer to observe the airspace, the ADS B traffic. But like I said, that cost is ultimately going to disappear completely because there's no role really there. Mission planning is automated for us, so when a customer signs up with us we don't see them. We don't talk to them. There's no interaction. they drop a pin where they would like us to deliver. And then we use data to decide if that pin is a safe place or not. And they're in the system. And when the aircraft flies to them, we do check while we're there to make sure the area is clean. In other words, it's less than a 15 degree angle. It's inanimate. There's no people underneath. And all that's automated for us so that there's no observers required. The mission planning is quite interesting actually because there's a couple of things that are surprisingly innovative in that space. I would like to say rocket science, but it's not rocket science, but the flight planning to optimize for energy use, depending on prevailing wind is important. And then we stream the weather from the aircraft that are in the air. So we have very accurate, very localized and very real time weather data that informs the next flight. And so that's a really important optimization for us in both speed of delivery, but also in, in energy drawn, which allows us to have that nice wind envelope or nice wind capability. And so that's very important, but another equally important part of what we do is mitigating ground risks. So, we have an effective population density where we fly. Like it is very populated where we fly. It is very dense. It's as dense as the Bronx or Queens, for example. It is really dense. And we're flying over about 450 houses with every single flight. So we take ground mitigation very seriously. And we do a lot of work there. And one of the feeds that we have is real time location data from users of our code, of our apps that they give us permission to have, and we'll monitor the space for hotspots of people. And that's a really important addition to what we've done. And so that data tells us, like, for example, if there's a beer garden, there's 500 people drinking beer outdoors in the middle of the summer. And we'll know they're there and we'll automate the flight plan around that. And so that for us has proven to be quite an easy thing to build where data didn't exist before. You couldn't really get that insight into where people were before. And in an anonymous way use it to mitigate your flights. So the flight planning is quite interesting in our world. And then the other part is aside from risk, just pure ground risk mitigation. You always think about, you don't want to be flying over the same places all the time. You want to avoid channels down certain areas to overbother people. So we ran, I wouldn't say randomized, but we, in the flight planning, we do a lot of work to reduce the effect of overflights. And that's been a key part of the acceptance aspect of what we're doing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What third party software are you using, Bobby, in that process?

I suppose our strength as a team has been in software, our businesses before have all been software businesses and either way, I think, if there was available software to buy in that space, we'd probably have bought it if it met our needs. But you have to balance always with software. The difference between software that's 95 percent what you need and 100 percent what you need is probably five years. I'm a programmer myself. That's my trade. It's often better just to build a simple system that exactly meets your needs, then adopt a complex system that more or less meets your needs. And in our case, like it is not rocket science where we're building, we're not going to be famous for how awesome our software or our hardware is. That's not what we're going to be famous for. We're going to be famous for our lowest unit cost and our ability to scale that, I think. But to answer your question, we use zero third party software.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm curious, I have to ask, have AI coding assistant technologies made an impact on your organization's ability to write this software?

I wouldn't call it strategic. I would call it an optimization. We're faster writing code. We're better at testing code. It just reduces the time to write code, but once code is written, the AI is no use to you and, we have a mature platform now, so we're more I'd say tinkering, we're optimizing doing small additions and it's very difficult to let an AI into existing code and start adding things. It's more when you write it from the start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Does it tilt the equation between building your own software versus buying software? The decision you would have made three years ago versus the decision that you will make three years in the future on that question.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I don't think so. no, it, it just, when you're assessing the number of people you need, or more importantly, you might get a, someone that's a, an average to strong programmer up a level. You might, get individuals just up a level. Like some of the code I would have written recently, and I use ChatGPT or Copilot, to write some of my own code. I'm writing code now that takes two or three days. That might've taken me a couple of weeks to write before. Mostly now when you're writing code, you're using frameworks or APIs that already exist to take a lot of learning, to take a lot of time to get to use, particularly in the AI and the vision space, and that's just like, I wrote some code recently myself that, that used our security cameras to look for people walking close to an aircraft or onto one of our landing pads. That code took me less than two days to get into production. And that's something that would have taken me a month to write before. And I'm, programming 35 years. So, so think about it that way. And I think that's the only right way to think about it. Just, it just makes existing good programmers faster and better. It doesn't replace the programmer. And so your decision, whether to buy versus build would more be about if somebody has matured a platform already that has done a scale drone delivery operation, it automatically by that fact will have evolved into the right piece of software for us, and I would buy that all day long, but nobody has written a piece of software that runs a drone delivery business at scale yet, except us. And I would say Wing. And so would I buy wing software? Yes. I would buy Wing's software, but I wouldn't buy anyone else's because the software evolves in line with the way you use it and you have to use it in order to develop it, I think.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You mentioned earlier that the consumer pays upwards of maybe 60 percent of the value of the meal with traditional, terrestrial food delivery. How does the drone economics impact, the wallets of the customers and the restaurants?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that, that number comes from actually a McKinsey work in the USA where they measured and it's, yeah, it's a 55 to 60 percent increase. So you buy a pizza for$30, you're paying$45 or a little bit more. In our case, we, I mean, you can get our app, we're charging customers$5 a delivery. And we haven't seen it. That's a little bit more expensive than they might pay for that direct. Here's my delivery fee number on the ticket. but we don't mark up the menu. We don't add surcharges. There's no tip obviously for the drone. So to the customer, actually, we're probably on a par with existing road based delivery, the way they might see it. Now it's only in the USA that everyone pays this gigantic premium on basket. In Europe they're paying about$7 fully loaded, but with tip and all that stuff. And so we're kind of in a par and I think a better question is, do we think there's room to charge more? Or do we need to charge less? and I think that's comes down to elasticity of demand. The drone does, favors there. It's really elasticity of demand on consumption, right? Whether they want the hamburger, whether they're willing to get it delivered or go outside. And if we're much more expensive than road based delivery, that's where the elasticity comes in. They're just going to go back to road based delivery. So I think our industry always needs to be on a par at worst with the existing mode or otherwise better. And then that translates again, back to our unit cost story. We think there's a world where a subscription is a real thing in drone delivery. And that's where we'd like to be. We'd ultimately like every household in the world uses us like Amazon Prime or like Spotify or just part of their monthly, thing in the household. And we think we can get marginal costs down to the point where that will work. And just like Prime or just like Spotify this is an almost inconsequential monthly cost for a household and we can use that to subsidize deliveries and still make our money by charging our partners a commission on basket value. So, we see enormous upside in the take rate or the revenue per delivery without needing to increase the cost to the consumer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How do you expect unit cost numbers that you shared with us to change in the U.

In Europe, that means implementation of U-Space. The regulations are there, U-Space is there. It's just rolling it out, but there's already four or five countries in Europe that will have U-Space this year. And USA, I think that Part 108 is the answer for scale. I don't think 135 is, although there can be the initial growth and scaling in the USA, which I think we'll all do a little bit of, but true, unlimited, unconstrained scaling, I think needs 108. So that's the bits that are out of our control. I think everything else is just execution. It's a capital intensive world, so you need a lot of capital to scale this, even though it's got a good return on it. Like our capital returns in 14 months when we open a new location, it's funded itself after 14 months. But you still, as we're growing a lot, you're going to need, a lot of capital to fund that growth. And I think debt will be a big part of that finance of the aircraft, just like in aviation. So will that be a constraint? Probably not. So then you move on to, again, the things that are in our control, but will quickly get out of our control. If we don't act properly and responsibly as an industry and as individual operators, we'll be punished by regulation. Cities will slow us down like they did the scooter industry. If there's accidents or, anything really that worries people, that will slow us down. So there's a risk there that with the rise of good regulation and the issuing of licenses that people might try to go too fast when they're not ready. They're rushing to get an aircraft to market. They start flying it and they ruin the party for everyone else. If anything slows us down in a material way, that will be it. And will it happen? I doubt it because I think the regulator on both sides of the pond have been very thoughtful about this. And I don't think anyone will be allowed to fly at scale unless they're safe. I just don't see a world where, you're going to have, people allowed to take risk. We obviously are not going to, but I don't think it's a world where you're going to have small operators that raise a seed round and start flying around communities. I don't think that's going to happen at all. I see this being an industry of two or three big players worldwide that will operate properly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby in three years, are you a$15 million,$50 or a$500 million revenue company?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In three years,$100 million plus, I would hope to think, and that could very well be all in Europe as well with some of the contracts we've signed and with the state of the market here, there's every possibility that we could get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And at a hundred million, you're a top three player you're saying in the world?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In drone delivery, we want to be the number one.

If we just got to a thousand of them, that's a billion dollars revenue business and with a contribution that pays for itself in 14 months.

So it isn't, obviously the marginal cost of a unit is there always. We have to manufacture, we have to deploy the boots on the ground. It's a difficult business to scale. I compare us to a Starbucks rollout back to the Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz was on the podcast recently and he broke the numbers down and he said, look, it's half a million for us to generate a million dollars in revenue. It takes two years to pay back. And so he's all about debt financing and trying to go fast, but just it's slow. And I think we won't be as badly affected by that, but that's naturally difficult part of scaling our business. It'll take a while to get to a billion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already touched on this in the conversation about availability, there's, two potential paths that somebody in this industry might take in terms of how deep in a given geography they want to go, whether they want to offer a full capacity service to the customer in one smaller area or expand a little bit more aggressively, but not go perhaps as deep. How do you think about that trade off?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we think about kind of Goldilocks suburb of hundred thousand people and up, potentially we could make slightly smaller ones work. So think 50, 000 people and up. And if you look at that as a filter, there's some other ones like number of restaurants within a hundred meter radius of an anchor restaurant, an anchor tenant, things like that. But if you filter it down, you come to about 10, 000 locations, as I said, in Europe alone, that, that are viable for us to deliver a minimum number of, orders. so, and then if you say, okay, from a strategy point of view, do you want a thin layer? That means then you have that incumbency, advantage in, in many markets at once or as fast as possible, or as you said, do you just own a handful of markets such that they're impenetrable and you don't share them with anyone? And we've seen that play out in food delivery, in the USA and then later on in Europe. We've seen the way it goes. Each market gets its own lead player. And then 10 years on, there's consolidation for efficiency reasons, mostly, and you end up with two or three players in the region, in the continent. And I think there's a potential where if we just stayed in the main European markets, that a smaller business will start up in Sweden and one in Spain or whatever, we'll and for us anyway, we don't want to let that happen. We want to go slightly thinner in more geography, early than going deep. And primarily because we learned from the previous two industry scooters and, food delivery, and you could argue mobility as well. So, on demand rides where if you leave a market alone, something will grow there, and then you're postponing a problem of either competition on economics or, competition on marketing and owning the customer, and I think it's better therefore it's not a black and white, but I think generally we would favor going wider and more shallow. That's a stronger position to be in.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just to make sure I understand when you say that shallower and wider, do you mean not saturating a metropolitan area with presence in every suburb, but, perhaps a few suburbs but you're not thinking that, okay, once I'm in one of those suburbs the shallowness will be a characteristic of the service that you offer such that the risk is that you disappoint customers when they go to the app and say, oh, okay, great. Thanks. I can't get the service. I'm disappointed.

It'll be the aggregators and the vendors won't give them a choice because it's a lot cheaper for them to fulfill that order. So when we say shallow, in an area, it means we go to a large city we'll do all of the suburbs over 50 to a hundred thousand people, but the suburb that's only 25, 000 or less, they're not getting the service because we'd prefer to be growing to the other suburbs in Madrid and Berlin and Stockholm and so on\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right.

You've got these real, tiny little restaurants tucked away in corners. And there's just, you're not going to get an aircraft there, but we'd like to think the 60th or 70th percentile of volume, we'd be able to get, and that in terms of volume of, or choice translates to less than 50 percent of choice. or percentage of restaurants in the area that you'd need to care about. But don't forget it. Go back to coffee.

And as you think about advanced air mobility overall, let's say we break it down to a couple of different buckets. Let's say military drones, let's say commercial drone delivery, whether it be coffee, medical or the like. Or three, let's call it eVTOL, STOL let's say those are three big segments of AAM. What excites you and let's say you were an investor and you had to invest your money. I will assume you will say commercial coffee drone delivery will be an early candidate for investment. What would be next and what would be last?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">My next, without a doubt, in fact, if I wasn't doing this now or I wanted to do something new, it'd be military, defense, look at Anduril or Look at the geopolitical landscape right now and there's a race for sure to arm countries defensively with technology and that technology without a doubt is going to come in the form of flying robots largely, and that's going to have myriad sensor tech, software. It's a software play more than a hardware one. There's obviously a fusing of them, but I find that a really interesting space. And I think, the world is going to be investing a ton of capital in there and the opportunities are enormous and I'm probably unusual in that. I think that's a good thing that industry thrives because it's actually a way to reduce war, not increase war. So that's what I would be doing and I'd be doing it from the USA. cause I think that's where most of the investment's going to happen. So yeah, that's what I would be doing. I wouldn't bet on passenger mobility for a while. I just think it's too hard. I just don't think the physics work well enough yet, and the economics are, I find them difficult to see. You know, they work and it'd be interesting for sure, but I would, I'd be investing in, and working in military defense tech before I'd be doing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As you think about aviation technology, as you think about advanced air mobility, who are the thought leaders out there that you listen to? Who are the people that we say, well, when they talk, that's somebody I give a lot of time to.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You guys,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Nice.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I listen to your pod obviously all the time. I love it. but there's a number of players that, I have huge respect for. I don't want to embarrass them all, but I think, Keller and Zipline has done a super job. I think Adam Woodworth in Wing is an amazing guy. I met him last year. What they've achieved is remarkable. And closer to home, my own team, I have Siggy Zerweckh, 25 years in General Atomics that just, oozes aviation engineering. I'm wowed by the engineers, so you can probably hear that. And thought leadership in the space for me, more important than those, engineering visionary types that I mentioned are the ones that actually understand business as well. And there I'm afraid the industry is guilty of not being real from a business sense, but I have to say, it would be for me, Google and what they've achieved and drone delivery is who I would hold up in the highest regard. And thought leaders, most of your guests, I think, if I look back, you've done a good job of choosing them and I find them really every time I'm surprised, I've never heard of this person. And then suddenly I've met, somebody that's really understands the space better than I could have imagined. So, so many choices.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">One thing I think might be interesting to explore are your thoughts on, the capital that is going to fund the scale out of drone delivery. Right now, it has been primarily funded by venture capital, but clearly there are other types of investors that are going to step in and fund the scale out and thinking about, from your vantage point, who are they, what are the things that they want to see and then what will the financing of the scale out likely look like?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. So I think for who's going to pay to scale it out and what, how does the industry, get the capital it needs to really grow at its natural ability. The numbers are gigantic, right? There's probably a couple of hundred thousand, half a million aircraft are going to be needed in the next five to 10 years, maybe more, maybe less. These are big numbers, in terms of cash needs. I do though, think that the industry lends itself well to venture. We're certainly backed by venture, and we would foresee quite a bit of our future growth. So for us, we'll grow with a blend of debt and venture because we throw off cash now, remarkable as that sounds, we generate cash in a location. So we see ourselves as being probably 60, 70 percent debt funded. So think asset financing type growth and then equity is the other part and private capital for that. So venture. There's an argument that might say, private equity could get there as well. Large private equity firms could get there too. But our ambition is to take the business public as soon as we can. That is a moving feast because public markets are, not in great shape, but by the time we get to that 50 to a hundred million run rate revenue, I think the right thing to do for a business like ours is going to be to IPO because of the profile of investor that's available there. The retail investor will be very important to us as well. The amount of capital we will need to raise to grow it, as I said, to be the leader is enormous. And so it's our ambition to float the company as quickly as we physically can. But I don't think that's in the next two years. It's probably from three years onwards, but there's, there is an outcome where we're floating this business in three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, as we wrap up, what are some of the things that you'd like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the most important thing is the audience to understand that the economics have now been proven for this space. The viability of it has been proven very clearly, that this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That's, that is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think. There has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:26:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Excellent.

This technology of distributed electric propulsion systems and advanced flight control systems is revolutionary. And we must apply the evolutionary learnings that we have had over the last 120 years. And by doing so, in the thesis I lay out, you're helping to ground that base and think about, okay, let's not just run down the hill. Let's walk and make sure that we can cover all the aspects that we need to cover. Our air transportation industry is the safest mode of transportation in the world. And yet we still have some certainly surprises that occur in aviation safety and in the design of the vehicles, in the control systems. We've all seen them in recent times. And here, these are processes and aircraft that have been around for quite some time. So I just want to make sure that we stay grounded in that we don't just accept the fact that we've got this new technology and it's going to just work immediately and be safe because it's new tech. We've got to go through the processes and procedures and time, of use to bring this to a scalable solution for transportation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Welcome to a much anticipated return of David Stepanek, Executive Vice President, Chief Transformation Officer of Bristow. Few can offer a more seasoned, measured, practiced, realistic view of where advanced air mobility has been, is, and perhaps where it's going. For those who have taken a careful, realistic approach to advanced air mobility, this discussion is a confirmation of your smart approach. We've been so eager to have guests back for a second conversation. Because the earlier impressions and assumptions mature over time. And in some cases they hold true and in others, they evolve. Hearing how things have changed can be of great value to our listeners, OEMs, operators, as well as investors. We're particularly fortunate that David and team have taken the time to write A Philosophical Guide For Early Operations. As they have put their thoughts on paper, on how advanced air mobility should be carefully and properly deployed. David and Bristow have been early adopters, buyers, and implementers of the advanced air mobility so their initial and subsequent assumptions and realized outcomes, carry great weight. As David mentioned often throughout the guide in our talk, he believes that those who have experience in vertical flight and being experienced operators, have a particular edge in evaluating, deploying, and scaling advanced air mobility. So listen to David's summary of the guide his five point thesis and general observations, his discussion of health management and flight operational data to enhance and optimize safety, and David's thoughts on what early advanced air mobility assumptions have proved out according to plan and what has changed from what some had thought just a few years ago. Given how precient David and team were just a few years ago, perhaps we'll listen even more and how he views the future of advanced air mobility as well as its risks and opportunities. Additionally, perhaps we even be a bit more critical and circumspect of those who have an interesting idea, but don't really know how, or don't have experience in bringing tech to the aviation market. Many thanks to David for his return visit and an important and engaging discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with David Stepanek as you innovate and generate positive financial returns in The Vertical Space. David Stepanek became Bristow's Executive Vice President Chief Transformation Officer in March, 2021. In this role David is leading the transformation of Bristow by introducing the next generation of advanced air mobility aircraft and expanding Bristow's core business in new regions. Through David's efforts Bristow has forged strategic relationships with multiple advanced air mobility manufacturers, leveraging Bristow's 75 years of safety management and vertical lift operations. He participates in a variety of public speaking engagements related to advanced air mobility operationalization and overcoming the hype of advanced air mobility to bring it to reality. David previously served as Bristow's Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer responsible for Bristow's global operations, supply chain, and IT. Prior to joining Bristow, David held positions with PHI, including President of PHI's energy business, and PHI Americas. David started new carrier businesses for a Phi in Australia, Cyprus, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad. He also led PHI's acquisition of Helicopters New Zealand in 2017. He has held board positions with Cougar Helicopters and HeliOffshore the global safety focus association for the offshore helicopter industry. David spent 20 years at Sikorsky aircraft in a variety of leadership positions. Including technical support customer service and commercial sales. During this time with Sikorsky David sold and delivered the first commercial S-92 model helicopter and booked over a billion in commercial helicopter sales. David is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Hey, David, welcome again to The Vertical Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My pleasure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, David. So we're going to ask the same question as we did the beginning of the last podcast, as we do all podcasts. What, is something that very few in the industry agree with you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A majority of the folks in this industry, the companies in this industry don't agree with me that really cargo is the way to move first. And that pragmatic approach to it. And that's driven by business models that have been, The activity levels that have to happen in order to infer some of the, returns that their investors are going to expect. So they're moving forward with, more of a urban mobility or transportation model, in and around the cities. Notably, what's potentially gonna be happening with, in the Middle East, in the United Arab Emirate with several of the different, OEMs that are vertically integrated. And then also the, the potential with, airline transfers in the New York region first. So, I want them to be successful. I do. I, I think they're going to be faced with certain challenges, but for Bristow and for, I think the vast majority of the theses that we've laid out is that cargo transportation will, in a business to business model, is the approach early to allow us to scale to, the different, unique business models of, of both regional mobility and urban mobility. As we, transfer, through the next, next five to 10 years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, how is that controversial?

And there's a couple of reasons that, you are the first person to return. One is to discuss your new guide, The Philosophical Guide for Early Advanced Air Mobility Operations. And number two, let's face it, there are not many people who have led the community like you have with, with partnering with an awful lot of very prestigious organizations who are, leading the way in advanced air mobility. So, to be able to hear your thoughts expressed in the guide, but also expressed in, what you've seen over the last couple of years and what's changed. That's probably one of the most important thing is what's changed. So if you could just give us a little bit of an overview of the guide, an executive summary, because everybody should read it, but give us an executive summary of the guide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll do my best. First, I think I should probably outline why I decided to write the guide. it's somewhat unique in doing so, and when I was talking to some of the executives within Bristow while I was doing this, First of all, they were like, what are you doing here? are we going to lean into some of our intellectual property? Are we going to tell people exactly what to do and generate more competition? My response is that our stated vision is to be a leader in innovative and sustainable vertical flight solutions. And, and being a leader really means rising other people up as well and, being part of the process. So our core competencies is one of the values that we believe that Bristow brings to the advanced mobility space. And without divulging some of the secret sauces that we use to, to manage our core competencies, I wanted to express the philosophies that we use and that we've learned over the 75 years of operating helicopters and airplanes to this industry and why. And so that was That was part of it. The other is I outlined some observations that I've made and those are concerns. So there's these observations that I've made that are outlined in the guide, and I wanted to express that and, and then offer some potential solutions or at least thoughts on, on solutions. And the third part is really intersected the, the other two to be the impetus to get me to write down this was, I work with an executive coach I have for a decade, and I was discussing with him the thoughts that what we're doing, the thoughts, some of the challenges that I'm, we're, we're facing, some of the frustrations that I have in trying to, to relay the messaging that I want to get across in a very short time period, generally that we have with, whether we're working with governments or business people or investors, you get 15 or 20 minutes. It's hard to get a very complex. thought process or complex philosophy across in that. And he said, well, you're basically writing the book on this. And then he went, that's what you should do. You should write the book. So, I laughed and said, I'm a busy man. I don't have time necessarily to, write something that needs, that's as complex as this, and that would be as in detailed. He encouraged me to use a ghostwriter and I thought about that a little bit further. One of the things that I like to do when I'm on holiday or go on very long, multi day, hikes. So last summer I was on a hike in Spain and I had a few days to really think about it. And I put the outline in my brain and jotted it down and decided to write it myself over the Christmas holidays. And so those were the three real factors there. And then I wanted to lean on people that I work with and people that I've talked to, people that I respect that have maybe a different, viewpoint of whether it's aircraft certification or government relations or the real technical aspects of the advanced mobility space. So I leaned on a lot of people, three I mentioned as contributing editors, and, and they, they had a, real big input to, what you, you finally got to read. Richard Lapin is an expert in government relations and international relations. And he's worked with various governments around the world. Marc Poland is an old colleague of mine. He retired from Sikorsky a number of years ago. He was one of the first, if not the first program manager on the S-92 and brought that aircraft through certification and launch of commercialization. And then, Dr. James Wang, the professor at a university in Singapore, he built the first tilt rotor, eVTOL aircraft, Project Zero in 2011, which he showed me back then. So I was able to really lean on them and bring some of their concepts and ideas and thought processes in. And I felt like once we had it written in a draft format, it was something that a lot of people could utilize. And I didn't write it for technical experts and I didn't write it for the, necessarily the people that are deeply involved in advanced mobility, but this ecosystem is going to be very large. There are going to be a lot of people that have never worked in air transportation or transportation in general. There are going to be a lot of investors that are going to be thinking about coming into this space. Because the total available market is substantial and it's going to spread across the globe. There's be a number of hundreds of different companies that are going to start up. So the thought is we've got this great philosophy about how to bring aircraft into service and the things you need to think about specifically in vertical aviation. And hence I jotted it all down and it's really 40 years of, my experience and others.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As you read the guide, you can hear a couple of themes that are loud and clear. One is there was a lot of exuberance early on, and there was a lot of promise early on. And that, in some ways, your guide is a de risking. guide, isn't it? Here's a way to de risk your investment. Here's a way to de risk if you're an OEM. So give us a couple of the areas that you think somebody reading the guide would perhaps think differently than where they are today. Whether they be the OEM or whether they be an operator. Whether they be experienced in vertical lift or not.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, one of the things I hope to get across in this was that once these aircraft are type certified by an airworthiness regulator. That that's not the end. We don't just, now we have an aircraft that's certified and produced. It goes to a dealership or it goes into the market. And we just turn them on. Like we do an automobile. To operate these aircraft for hire, for service, or to provide service to, the public or governments, you're an airline, so recognize that, and that stems from, I presented it to, Smart Cities Conference a couple of years ago. And these are mega cities, very, very smart people that driving city planning with tens of millions of people in population with lots of different, infrastructure and logistics issues to deal with. And one of the comments that they came up with was that, this is just like buying an electric scooter or an electric car, I'm just going to put it into service and when I explained to them what's necessary to do that, it's, you're an airline and you have to abide by the rules. By, by the rules and regulations that drive the, the air transportation system. So that's one. The other is that it's not easy. So being an air carrier is not just I buy the best stuff or the best aircraft and I put it into service and I hired it. There's so much more that goes into the thought processes of, not just which aircraft you buy, but how you configure it for its purpose. What are the process and procedures that you're going to utilize for the missions that you've outlined for your business plan? And how do you impart your culture of safety throughout the entire organization? So that's a very difficult process. It's relatively easy to buy an aircraft. Takes capital. A lot of people can raise capital. It's a little harder, right? Process and procedures, but you can hire some of that too. So you can hire some experts and you can get a lot of things just right off the shelf. The hard bit is having a culture that, it's a very top of the leadership, which I believe in, most, if not all cases, leaders of organizations want everybody in their organization to be safe. How you manage that and how you make that happen is a little bit more difficult than just wanting it. So you've got to be, you've got to have it in your DNA. You've got to have it in the way that you lead, the way you present yourself and the rest of the leadership team throughout the organization. Cause at the top people want to be safe, leadership wants to be safe, and at the line level, they're the ones that are executing, they're the ones that are going to cut their fingers, they're the ones that are going to trip and fall, they're the ones that are going to get hurt. They obviously want to be safe too. It's in the middle where you have this drive. So if you could see like an hourglass where you're driving people for execution, you're driving people for profitability, you're driving people to meet schedules, How do you make sure that they're imparting the philosophies and beliefs of that company? That's the hard bit. So it's not just I snap my fingers, I buy an aircraft, I get an air operating certificate and I'm ready to go. There's so much more to it, and I believe, and what I impart in this philosophical guide, is that companies like Bristow, not necessarily has to be Bristow, but companies that have this experience over the years and have done it over time, can put these aircraft into service in a very limited case and share the information of operational inefficiencies or data or technical problems with the industry to help improve the safety. At the same time, we're demonstrating to the regulator, safe, efficient operations that will allow the expansion of different, into different businesses. And hopefully at the same time, we're proving out to the public where there's been certainly some disarray, if you will, if you think about the, issues that, that Volocopter has been faced with in Paris and, really the citizens not wanting that to be operated during the Olympics or in the city at all. We can turn this into a more normal mode of transportation through that process. And that will allow investors and entrepreneurs to do either invest in companies or raise the capital necessary with the data that's been produced by these early operations to allow this expansion of the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the topic of all the steps that an air carrier needs to go through in order to introduce a new type to their operations. In your guide, you mentioned that that can take between, 12 to 18 months. everything inclusive of training, supply chain planning, writing of the operating manuals, maintenance planning, et cetera, et cetera. To what extent can this be parallelized? Talk a little bit more how that integrates with the discussions that you're having with OEMs. And to what extent is this really a serial operation as opposed to parallel?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll speak to it in two categories. One is if, we were buying a traditional aircraft that's already been type certified and in service, where that's very much a parallel operation. Say you decide to buy a new type of aircraft for your operation, they've produced it before. You're running the training organization. You're writing of the manuals. You have known performance to deal with. So you can write that in parallel with it. For an aircraft that's not yet been type certified, it's a little more challenging because there could be some constraints that appear before certification process. And there also could be some regulatory shifts or training shifts and how you're going to operate. So you try to run that in parallel as much as possible. One to align with the allocation of capital to buy the aircraft and two to speed up the, in service time, but it's, it, there's likely going to be a lag. So it's going to, run somewhat in parallel and somewhat in series, for the early adoption. And one of the things I mentioned in the document is, and this is from experience, early adopters with the wherewithal, with the financial capability to withstand and be resilient to certain aspects, the capital that's being employed, potentially with some alternative solutions in case there's a problem. We tend to have a little bit more patience with an OEM and a regulator when we're challenged with different problems, whether it's a technical problem, a regulatory problem, something that's cropped up in the operations. So you've got to be able to work within that whole process. And that can in part can actually slow training down. It could slow the aspect of staying current with that particular aircraft, if you have a gap in operations for a month or two. So all those things you'll have to deal within, the early operations side of things. So if you build a business model to just go out full throttle straight away, every aircraft flies every day, we're not going to have any issues. I mean, you're really setting yourself up for some disappointment and potential issues.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A good chunk of the document also covered your thoughts on early operations. Can we spend some time talking about how your current view on early operations has changed over the years and, how you see the evolution of these early markets?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So back to the pragmatic approach, that's why I want to do something in a constrained environment with business to business operation. Because one of the unique, aspects of these vehicles, specifically the 100 percent battery electric aircraft, that's certainly nothing that we have to deal with the traditionally powered aircraft is, will likely take off at maximum or close to maximum gross takeoff weight to get the most performance we can out of these vehicles. We're also going to land at maximum gross takeoff weight, whereas traditional aircraft will be landing at a lighter weight because you've burned off the fuel, all those things. So that means we're really putting the maximum stresses on the aircraft at both takeoff and landing. The business models and the range capabilities of these vehicles are going to require multiple takeoff and landings a day. And so we don't understand, surely, through the certification, there'll be analysis that's done and there'll be margins put on the structural integrity of it. But I do think that we'll likely see issues that will hopefully be rectifiable, that we'll have to deal with on the structural side of things. I relay back to experience with traditional helicopters. As I reflected, I couldn't think of one aircraft that we put in the service early that did not have some sort of, a structural issue that we had to deal with, whether it's sponsons and landing gears, or the frames around the primary drive system, engine mounts. You tend to have, higher use cases and higher vibration message in operations than you would in flight test. And you might not see them in flight test, you may not have predicted that these things could happen, but, but they tend to happen in these different environments. So having that temperate environment with, average temperatures, moderate humidity, not a lot of rain and thunder and lightning. Those early operations will allow for that testing and as, as we put them in harsher environments, we're going to see other issues that are going to crop up with these machines and how we deal with them and how we have the resilience and wherewithal to deal with them and ensure that we have a business model that can withstand, the financial challenges that are going to be faced with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. One of the things that stood out, part of your theses is that early operations should be over low population, low density, airspace type of geographies. And just to make the conversation a little bit more interesting and spicy here, I'm going to poke some holes, but, intuitively, intuitively, this makes sense. But at the same time, the regulator will not allow a new type to fly unless they are convinced that the aircraft is safe to be integrated into the national airspace system and safe to be flown over, whatever geography it is, approved to fly over. And so, to make an analogy when, when Boeing or Airbus introduce a new airplane, they don't have a restriction as to what airports they can be flown in and out of. Now, granted, those are systems that are well understood and we have decades of operational data to understand them. But at the same time, it just feels like this, constraint of early operations might impose some, economic penalties early in the use cases where those are needed the most.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had a sense that this was going to raise some controversy. And the hypothesis is really around several different ideas, and it's not just about the concern over safety of that operation, the concern that you may have to land the aircraft in a, unplanned environment. That is part of it, but it's not all of it. The other part of our business model thesis is, that these vehicles early on should provide services and goods to services to areas that are in need of it, that have, poor road systems, poor transportation systems that need to have materials brought to them in a more efficient manner. So when I think about those environments, I'll give you a couple of examples. Scandinavia has geographical barriers, so you have a lot of fjords. You have great road systems, but they take lots of time to get to. You have some transportation on rail, but not a vast majority like you have in most of Central and Western Europe. And then there's places such as the northern territories of, Australia, there's places within continental United States that fit that as, as well, and, others. And, those also tend to be, and it may not seem intuitive, but the coastal areas of Scandinavia is somewhat temperate. We have very few icing days. It's close to our supply chain. So that was one of the reasons behind it is, is that we think that there's a really good economic business model for that particular mission, and it serves the purpose of isolating the system in case there is an issue, we can deal with it. So it wasn't just about trying to put a constraint around use case of these of these machines. It was really our philosophy that we had stated very early that we think is the is the right business case for it, whether it's the islands of Scotland or fjords of Norway or, pick another country that has similar characteristics. I think Japan's another really good example, even though you've got a great rail system, you've got a condensed population with very mountainous region with lots of, rugged coastline that, that needs to be supported.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you mind sharing maybe some details when you looked at some of these use cases, in terms of the size of this market opportunity, how that compares to the initial expectation of these aircraft being used for the commuter market, what's their relative size and, can OEMs really scale, as expected in those early use cases?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the latter part of your point is I think important to note because the scaling is, I believe it's not going to be at the peak levels that, we're talking about early. So the production levels I believe they're not going to hit some of the early projections. It's going to be in the 25 to 100 to 150 aircraft per year until you scale new production and you have to distribute the production facilities globally, if you, plan to, penetrate those markets. So we've done, I gotta be careful what I say here. there's, there's a lot of work that's being done. A lot of it's being done under a non disclosure agreement. but what we're looking at for, for these different regions in Scandinavia is potentially up to 50 aircraft. in service over a two year period that can generate, you can do the same math that, that some of the SPACs have been, have done it on. There's potential two to two to three million revenue per aircraft in that space. Not all of them will work every day. It is a nice market. It is a market that potentially could provide very good returns to the operator and the other people that are in investors in that process and will provide, the necessary data for the scaling, both in production and implementation into different mobility factors, whether it's regional passenger carrying and, or, into the urban side of things. The other part of that aspect with this. early adoption of cargo transportation is you're utilizing existing infrastructure. So there's not, necessarily a requirement to go out and invest heavily in concrete. Or heavily in ground facilities. There will be investments that will be necessary in, the charging networks that'll have to be put in place. There'll be some other investments in there as well with ground handling equipment and tooling. But not to the scale of having to build a 25 or 30 million VertiPort and going through the whole process of the real estate investments that are necessary for it early on. If it works, if these aircraft are viable, safe, efficient, and reliable, that will provide the data for the investment thesis that are going to be necessary for the substantial amount of capital that's going to have to flow into the, investment of infrastructure, real estate development, air traffic management, communication systems, all the things that are necessary. And then the other reason for the remoteness side of it is many of the the big airports in the big cities, they're very close or at capacity. So you'll hear things from certain city planners or airport planners. It's like, Oh, great. We'd love to have UAM in here, but just don't add any more airplanes to my system. I can't handle it. Whereas in these remote locations, you've got airports that are screaming for help. That are, that want this, to come in so they can actually build out a process which should potentially create, create new\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>jobs. So, Dave, if we take this Scandinavian network as an example, what would you see the utilization of those 50 aircraft in that network being and how would it compare to what has been circulated in the community as to the urban air mobility or the airport transfer use case? How do those compare to each other and what are the pros and cons in your mind?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some of the work that is cargo movements are in belly cargo today. So they're somewhat constrained by whatever the capacity of the aircraft is, depending on how many passengers they're utilizing, and what the payload available is. And then of course the commercial schedule. And then the other aspect is you're replacing lorries and trucks, depending on which part of the world you're in. As far as, utilization goes so analysis is done. It's at this point in time, it's a guess, what are we going to get for reliability? What's the backup requirements? What's the maintenance schedule? We don't, know those information yet, if you look at it, a helicopter operation, the maximum utilization we tend to get on a per tail number or per serial number aircraft is about 90 percent. So you say you take a 12 hour day. 90 percent of the time, we can get a helicopter going. To get to a higher utilization, you have to employ more capital and have additional assets in place for backups. In the helicopter world, it's a much more intense amount of capital than you see in fixed wing aircraft. So you know, it's not, I think it's a, it's not unusual for a company, ultra, low cost carrier with hundreds of aircraft that maybe have three or four backups. I don't know what the big carriers carry. So to get to that rate will take more capital. And that's what we'll be planning in a certain number of technical backups to support maintenance operations and downtime for technical capabilities. And what we've learned in the helicopter operation is that with the proper amount of, technical backup, we can get up to 99 percent utilization rate. And then if that's measuring dispatch utilization, and then now you got to talk about what's the utilization of the payload capabilities, of the, of the asset,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the number of flights\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>and the number of, number of, number of flights, then, and really that's going to be relative to the performance of the aircraft, the hazards which you need to mitigate. We're again, just building early schedules out, but we're, we're thinking about six hours of operation on a daily basis is, about the right way to start somewhere between six and eight hours. So you're taking into account whether you have to have additional crew, fatigue, risk management, the, turnaround time, what you have to download, if there's information to be downloaded, the charging side of things, there's six to eight hours of, of daily utilization should, should suffice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the absence of operational data, where do you find the basis to ground your assumptions as to the level of interest and how you prioritize these early use cases?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you want to go somewhat of a, the art of war, go where your enemy's not, or go where it's easy to penetrate, the market. So there are certain just jurisdictions in the world that are willing to, work with what they might call a sandbox operation to prove some of these theses out. So potentially taking aircraft, even in a pre certification role, in a limited case of scope, and doing actual commercial operations for it, so proving out that process. getting potentially some, PSO routes. And some other things, that could help support the, the economics of it. And then there's the sustainability aspect and then the potentially the economic aspect. And I think, sorry, go back to one of your first questions about what, other people don't agree, agree on is that, I, a lot of people are pushing the sustainability side and it's very important but the economic model and the cost structure of this has to work first. Otherwise, it's just, it's going to be a difficult process. So that's the grounding of it. So we're, I, I've spent a lot of time and my colleagues have spent a lot of time working with, within different networks, in government, working at different airport authorities, and different logistics companies and energy and industrial companies that are, are really keen to, to give this a try and, and see if it works. And that's why, again, back to the, earlier show, invest as little capital as possible, do it with an operation that has existing infrastructure to prove it out so we can scale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you feel that you've properly expressed your five point thesis? We've nibbled at it, but if you could just rattle off the five.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So my five theses are that early stage AAM operations should focus on a business to business model, a commercial model, that support a logistics network that's potentially already in place, and that you do that within a 20 to 60 kilometer range. That's the first part. Second thesis is that advanced mobility commercial operations will be required to be conducted by a licensed air carrier. So you're effectively an airline and particularly in the early stages our thesis is that, that airline should have some experience in vertical lift and in safety management to be the most efficient to doing so. Third thesis is that early stage AAM operations are best conducted by companies experienced in purchasing and configuring aircraft for their intended uses. AAM manufacturers would be best advised to work with these companies to ensure that the, the product that they're developing is commercially viable and, and we'll be able to be used by the use cases. And, and, and, and the genesis of that thesis is that there'll be equipment and use cases that are necessary that don't necessarily be, need to be part of a type certification. So aircraft that are type certified don't necessarily have to have an enhanced ground proximity warning system or a TCAS. But they're certainly needed for fit for purpose for certain operations. And then fourth thesis is early AAM operations should be conducted by air carriers using existing infrastructure with a willingness to collaborate with potentially new companies in order to share data that is not necessarily commercial but operational and safety to allow the AAM business to scale on a global basis. And that fifth thesis is that air carriers involved in AAM operations should have the appropriate equipment. processes, programs, and people in place to manage both the health and flight data that we're going to derive from these vehicles. And that in part will also allow a shorter timescale to do some of these early testings that I philosophize around learning that process of having more data than we ever had on any other aircraft will allow us to crunch that data, aggregate it, and understand the health of the vehicle in a much faster pace. So I think that by utilizing that data, you could accelerate into different and newer commercial models that, will potentially substantiate some of the financial theses that have been put forth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dave, so you lay out the rationale for these theses in the document, but if you were to sum it up for the audience, what is the theme running in the background through your thinking that led you to create these theses? I mean, it strikes me as an approach that is grounded in a more realistic, and experienced view of what operations are actually like, and brings that into the conversation. But, in your words, what are the underlying themes behind your conclusions that you create in these points?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, I want to say that, I'm absolutely optimistic about advanced air mobility and all the potential use cases of it. And I believe that optimism is a force multiplier. So I want to get that out, Chris, because there is certainly a grounding. And some people could see this as pessimistic, or some people could say this as, I have a poor view of some of the early operations that may occur outside of my thesis. So I'm very optimistic about it. But behind it is something that I talk about early on is we're at a revolutionary point in aerospace. This technology of distributed electric propulsion systems and advanced flight control systems is revolutionary. And we must apply the evolutionary learnings that we have had over the last 120 years. And by doing so, in the thesis I lay out, you're helping to ground that base and think about, okay, let's not just run down the hill. Let's walk and make sure that we can cover all the aspects that we need to cover. Our air transportation industry is the safest mode of transportation in the world. And yet we still have some certainly surprises that occur in, aviation safety and in the design of the vehicles, in the control systems. We've all seen them in recent times. And here, these are processes and aircraft that have been around for quite some time. So I just want to make sure that we stay grounded in that we don't just accept the fact that we've got this new technology and it's going to just work immediately and be safe because it's new tech. We've got to go through the processes and procedures and time, of use to bring this to a scalable solution for transportation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, in some ways, you're very blatant about it in your guide, but what you're basically saying is bringing technology to aviation is hard.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's super\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And for those of you who, I'm putting a little bit of a shameless plug in for our companies, because this is one of the things we understand, and this is how we help our customers. But it's hard. And for those of you who have not worked in bringing technology to market in aviation, there are so many hurdles that you can't anticipate. And just because you certified your plane, you have so many other things to consider. We all read what we want to read, right? But that really popped out from your guide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, thanks. I mean, that's, that's, that's really the, the gist of it. I, it is hard. What every one of these, entrepreneurs and designers and the OEMs are doing is super hard. Getting an aircraft to type certification is super hard, super expensive. And now you've got an aircraft type certified that you've been thinking about for five or six years and working on getting it designed. And then technology's advancing beyond your certification base. So you've got to work on catching that back up and this loop there. And then now you've got type certified. Now you've got to build it. You've got to build it in a manner that's reflective of the type certification in a repeatable way, in a high quality way which takes another couple hundred million dollars to build out a facility to get to the production levels that are going to be necessary for this to scale. And I think it's brilliant that many of these companies are leaning on automotive because I do think that that's what this is going to look like long term production. But building aircraft on automotive model, it's a different way of, of things. And I was sharing a story today with one of the OEMs, about an aircraft that's been in our, this aircraft, this is public information. We had an accident of a, of an aircraft two years ago, about a year and a half ago, actually. And, and what it was, was it was an installation defect that happened 11 years ago. The aircraft's been in service for 11 years and the defect finally materialized. And if not for the great coordination of our aircrew, it would have been a very catastrophic event. But the team was able to analyze what had occurred and manage the process and land the aircraft safely, albeit with a little bit of damage. So these are just, it's really hard stuff. And getting to repeat on a large scale of aircraft production, a helicopter manufacturer today on a very good year is doing maybe 50 to 60 aircraft a year. we're talking about that in a month now, or even more at scale. So how do you ensure that repetitiveness? How do you ensure that quality system throughout the hundreds of people that are going to, or, or even the people that be programming the robots to install it, all that's going to be a big challenge. So now you got to produce, and then you got to get it, get an airworthiness certificate on and get it to an operator or operate it yourself. Which also lends itself to a very difficult process. One, to convince yourself safe, efficient, reliable, convince your local regulator so you can get it on your operation specifications and ensure you have the aircraft fit for purpose to meet the mission and the environment that you want to run your commercial program on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay so based on these observations, what do you think about the aircraft OEMs that want to have that vertically integrated business model and also be the operator? What are the pros, cons, or implications of your observations on that path forward for a company?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's going to take a lot of capital. My first view, it's going to take a tremendous amount of capital, more capital than they would have if they were going to be a traditional OEM. And it's another step that's harder. So if you're a traditional OEM, you're part of two processes, potentially two processes, type certification, support of that type certificate and production. And now you're adding back in the third portion of, of the difficult processes of operating it and the complexities and the core competencies to operate and build are very, very different. I understand why some of the companies want to do it, specifically in the United States, and I believe that their business model makes sense to them, and I think they're going to be successful early on, and I want them to be successful early on. I've had discussions with both of them that are in a more vertical mode. Their success is going to hinge on a lot of the future successes of this industry because they'll be some of the early adopters. I do think it's a challenge to the business model and that they may have to, shift some of their thinking. And I think you're seeing some of that with each of them doing more international sales and partnering with a variety of different organizations. But in the other cases, you're somewhat of an homogenous society, if you think about it in that way, where you're the entire ecosystem and you have control of that, but you're also the entire ecosystem when something goes wrong your complete economic model shuts down no matter where you are in that process. So if you have a technical problem that you have to deal with over a certain period of times, both your production is in disarray or could be, in jeopardy and you're not flying, so you're not collecting any revenue at all. And there's no alternative for you because you don't have different, sources of, transportation. Whereas traditional operators such as ours, one of the reasons we have a variety of different partnerships with the OEMs is, it's our experience that we will have technical problems and we will need to use alternative aircraft that may not be the most fit for one when there's other problems with those vehicles. So, there's certainly that risk associated with it. That's what I see, but I, again, I do think that they've raised enough capital and that they can get through this process and get the aircraft into their operation. And I understand their process of doing so. And there's an argument that controlling the whole ecosystem under one management team could be safer and you're controlling your brand in a better way. So I understand that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And also vertically integrating at this stage of the life of this new market gives you the opportunity to learn faster and absorb the lessons learned from operations into your next generation of aircraft\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>precisely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>iterations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah.

I'm sure that somebody reading the guide might say, look, this really sounds like an incumbent that is trying to protect their position when faced with a wave of new entrants, right? Because, throughout the document, there are hints at how only current established air carriers have the, experience and the wherewithal and the competencies to pull this off and introduce these new aircraft. And so one thing that stood out as I was reading it is your comment that no matter how dedicated to the concept of mission, a company cannot set policies and fully understand and manage the risk and assurance of running air operations. This is a quote, without the experience that comes from being an air carrier. So what does that say about the landscape of emerging air carriers? Are you making a statement that all the future air carriers for these vehicles already exist today? Is it reasonable entrants? How's that going to play out?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely reasonable and expected and required because we can't all operate. across the globe. So you're a regional air carrier. Bristow itself is a global regional air carrier. We operate in 17 countries, 17 is all right. There's a lot more countries in the world than 17 where they'll have all their own regulations. They're going to need their own startup companies. They're going to need their own processes and procedures to do this. My thesis is that they can learn from us and we are willing to share that information. and collaborate to allow this to scale globally. The thesis is we think that it's best to start with us and this information can be discriminated quickly because we'll have so much data from the health of the aircraft and the flight data, and potentially some of the business constraints that we'll have to deal with, to allow that, that scaling, on a global basis. So that's why I say in one of the theses they must be willing to collaborate. So this is really a thing. We want to be a leader. We want to be a leader because we want a great business. We also want to be a leader because we think this is necessary for the sustainability of transportation, it's necessary for this new revolution of, of aerospace and technologies that are being applied. We think that we start with these eVTOLs, we start with these eSTOLs, and that the propulsion systems and the power systems and, the energy sources are going to get us to a point where this is a much broader transportation network. We can put it on a larger equipment, potentially even, transatlantic flights someday or transpacific intercontinental flight someday. So the, it starts here and companies like ours with that experience can help get that started. That's, that's the thesis behind it. And there's plenty of really great people out there that have that experience that can move around the companies or could come in and help with that technology for those startups as well. That it's not just that you have to be the company, but that team that you put together will need that experience or the lessons learned and we think that's one of our duties to this industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, as people have reviewed the guide for you before you published it, what's been some of the tougher questions they've asked you, or the challenges you've heard on the guide that you'd want to share with the audience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we spent two weeks deciding whether a takeoff was a noun or an adjective with a preposition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you can imagine who that was with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Alright.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, some of the review is exactly what some of the points that you've put out, specifically Luka that are you just trying to ring fence this business? I mean, this is going to be so large. The total market If successful early is massive. And there's no way that we would even want to ring fence that. So we, we think we can create our business on our attributes and that we think that we should help things. So there was that concern of the ring fencing. There was a tremendous amount of debate about, I did use some stronger languages in some of the early drafts about should or must. Or shall and must. so that, some of that, that came out. we got a little bit more detailed in the types of advanced air mobility aircraft, laying that out. I was a little concerned about being too technical. And then there's been a really great reception of the portions on safety management and data collection and how it's aggregated. I had a fireside chat at the Revolution Aero conference today. There was quite a few questions about what the data should look like. Who owns it? How does it work? How would you manage it? And I, my words were if an OEM or a major supplier that's managing the aircraft data doesn't want to share that information and aggregate it and work with the operators to ensure that we set appropriate thresholds, that we have algorithms to detect anomalies that we learn and that we have actions that come out of these measurements, that I'm, we're not really interested in, in working with those organizations. So back to collaboration. I think we, we all have to collaborate to get this started and get it going. Going as, as, as an ecosystem and a transportation network to, to allow it to grow, to really garnish the benefits that we all hope it can provide the world.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, real quickly on the aviation safety data.

And the epiphany I had on that, it was cause we're starting this organization, AAM Safety Consortium, is that Heli Offshore was founded in 2014. So we've been operating helicopters for 70 years, 60, 70 years. And we finally got around to putting a proper organization together to manage that. And speaking with the gentleman who runs Heli Offshore, and I was a former board member of Heli Offshore, if we had a chance to start at the very beginning, just imagine what we could have accomplished. So here's an opportunity. We have a clean sheet of paper. We have a very good template. And even, recently the Royal Aeronautical Society published a paper of kind of three issues that could potentially happen. They outlined pseudo accidents and what could occur, and they even mentioned the fact that having an organization such as Heli Offshore will help, mitigate, potential issues and accidents. That we have that information. Somebody has an information that needs to be shared because we're going to see different problems across the globe you'll have, and you may even see similar problems. For instance, somebody's an inspector's out there looking at an aircraft. They notice there's something wrong with the propeller. And it's delaminated, and it's delaminated in this section.

One, the numbers of aircraft will be substantially more. These are aircraft that are primarily going to be flown VFR, in low altitude space, so it's going to be having that assurance that the aircraft are being operated as the operation specifications and the company wants it to be operated in. I think it's going to have a greater impact on the industry. And then also it's interesting. You think about health and usage systems as a way to mitigate certain cost structures and improve the product reliability. but FOQA also comes into play here where you may see, even though it's, it's within the specifications of the aircraft or maybe within the operation specifications, you may see some use cases where you're wearing out wheels and brakes, and one base may be wearing out wheels and brakes at a higher pace than another. And when you look at FOQA, you can determine what's happening and potentially, mitigate that. So there's some, there's some really interesting, and this is an experience that I've had is there's some interesting economic benefits beyond just the assurance that the aircraft is being operated in a safe manner. And it's going to be also very important to play back into the training organization. And with the technologies we have today to replay in simulators and to replay in three dimensional models, it's going to help the new line pilots and the new engineers coming into play to learn some of the, lessons learned and see actual flights that have transpired, but it's also vital that FOQA is non punitive, unless there was a willful misconduct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, sure. David, given your guide, given you learned over the last couple of years, what would you have done differently at Bristow?

We are, I think, an early adopter, but on the scale of things, a lot was happening pre the merger of Bristow, so we really couldn't have done it. But there was quite a bit of work that had been done with the legacy, the pre merger era team. Mostly data collection and some discussion. So getting in earlier, maybe applying more human resources to it. We wanted to be very careful in, nascent business. We still, especially in 2021, weren't sure what's this was going to look like. It was a tremendous amount of capital flowing in. So I think applying a little bit more resource to it, I think would have, would have perhaps accelerated our processes. On the latter part of your question, I'm very pleased with all the companies that we've dealt with. It's difficult right now to say, because there's, there's really some other interesting products that are being developed and some interesting entrepreneurs that I just have to say to them, it's not you, it's me. We are at our capacity of our team. We're a very small team by design which allowed us to be somewhat flexible. So, having a little more resources could potentially have allowed us into different markets. The other aspect, and this was a question from the first discussion we had, because there was a lot of discussion about the drone market. Maybe entering or thinking about that a little bit more on a scaled basis. I still believe that for us to start a commercial drone business on our own is going to be difficult because of the nature of our cost structure and in the size of our business and the flexibility that small startups will have, they'll have the advantage there in the cost structure, but you know, working in a better way with, with some of the leaders in drones and cargo delivery on the drone side, I think would have been something that, but we're, we're somewhat into it now. There's been a partnership made with one of the, one of the big players that I'm really proud of. We're going to be doing some work with them, proving out certain operations and potentially doing concept of operations for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm glad you raised this because I was going to ask you how an organization like Bristow might think about using UAS of various payload capacities from a couple of hundred pounds to maybe a couple of tons even, to execute on the mission like you described in Scandinavia or Northern Australia, and thinking a little bit differently about, the movement of cargo in general, that's optimized, with these kinds of vehicles in mind that are cheaper to operate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Well, we certainly are thinking about that and that's in our portfolio with, Elroy Air Chaparral, you have a vehicle hybrid electric system, automatic loading and loading of the payload, the pod, capabilities of putting different payloads into the pod, including surveillance equipment and things that are necessary for coastal surveillance or whatever you happen to be doing and doing those operations, as you mentioned, in, in places like Australia, Alaska, Norway. There's a, an energy company in Norway that's been testing out some operations beyond visual line of sight long distance. They want a 200 kilo payload to support their energy, business to hot shot parts out. They've done the economic model. They understand what being able to get those parts in a fashion they can with a drone versus a helicopter or a boat, which is most cases they use, and they can increase the uptown of their rigs materially. We're talking millions of dollars a month of change of production earnings or, cost shutdown issues that they deal with. But that's actually absolutely our business thesis of using those size drones. For that, when I talked about, I was talking about the little one, little, littler ones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are those conversations like internally? What are the considerations when you think about adopting something that is a bit of a departure from your core competence? As you enter that gray zone, what are you comfortable, what do you fear the most? Shine some light, to our audience about those boardroom level discussions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So some are at the boardroom and some are really at the operational level. So as I mentioned earlier, we do operate, drones for His Majesty's Coast Guard, but that is a government organization. It's not a type certified aircraft. It's not a commercial license to do it because we can do it for public service. Operating a piloted aircraft, we do that, we understand it, we know how to do it, we've got licenses to do it. Going into a remotely piloted aircraft beyond visual line of sight, which we have core competencies in that business, but translating that into a commercial side is something that's not necessarily one of our core competencies. So what the fear is, what would it cost? What would it, how long would it take? Should we partner with, another organization that has some of those core competencies already and we could help some of the weaknesses that they may have, market access, working with energy companies, sort of things. Hence an early kind of discussion with one of them that's doing that. So that's a way to mitigate it. We're still going to be measuring whether we should do it ourselves, whether we need a separate, whatever jurisdiction we have in, do you have a separate operating certificate for that? Or do you put it onto your current commercial operating certificate? What are the risks associated? If you have a problem in the advanced air mobility side, how would it affect the traditional helicopter model? If you're on the same certificate, do we separate that? That's all the work that we're doing today, in terms of our roadmap to operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you look at that remotely piloted operation that you would be flying, how does it differ from the way the Department of Defense might be flying the same platform? I mean, you mentioned Elroy Air. Obviously, they're bringing forward a platform, for both markets, but when you really get close to it, are there some major differences that sort of rise to the level of gotchas for those companies? Or are you really laying out a path that is a consistent and scalable dual use path? Because obviously DoD right now is one of the most aggressive customers for this capability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so my answer is going to be somewhat speculative because I'm not in depth on what DOD and Elroy are working on, other than I know they're in the AFWERX process. But I will say that operating an aircraft to an oil rig or to a platform, and working for an energy company, comes with a lot more responsibility, a lot more requirements that they would put on that I believe that the military wouldn't necessarily apply in the general operation processes. The requirements for mitigating liability, limitations of the liability, insurance processes, consequential damages. If you bang up an oil platform, that's producing 10, 000 barrels of oil a day. Do the math. That's a pretty heavy liability. So it comes with a tremendous amount more oversight and potential responsibilities for the,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>operator. And just for background, when you run an operation out to an oil rig, let's say in the Gulf of Mexico, is the entire flight within the NAS or, what portion of it would be outside?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If we're flying VFR, most of the proportion beyond line of sight of the coast is not within the NAS. ADS B out has helped us get more in, and we do quite a few more IFR flights where we're controlled. That's within the United States. So we actually have to control and set up communication networks offshore, to ensure we have, communication navigation systems. We also use satellite downlinks and uploads to know position of the aircraft on a repetitive basis. It repeats about every 10 to 15 seconds and then they'll have some push to talk capabilities there. So it's a bit of a mixed bag depending on the flight and the location and, and whether they're flying in IFR conditions or not.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I wanted to get your thoughts on how our audience should be thinking about the market size of the mission set that you are putting forward in this document as the lowest risk path for scaling up. I believe that it's big. There are billions of people living in remote areas that need things. And there are lots of different applications, but it's not as conceptually obvious to the broader audience in terms of the scale of that as compared to the story around UAM and the things that this industry has raised a lot of capital on over the last few years. So you're close to it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:04:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:04:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How do you communicate that?

So what markets are we in today and what is the size of that prize and what is our right to win it? So on a total available market, and I'm going to go to this analysis that was done by a very reputable firm, by 2035. we think on the cargo market size of, of it is approximately 60, 000 aircraft, potentially, total market globally, cargo, same basic numbers for both urban and regional mobility side of it. So, you're thinking about a potential market size of 120, 000 aircraft. 2035 and beyond, maybe that's getting pushed down a little bit further. For Bristow, and, and back to the theses here, because that was the basis, some of those theses were the basis of the work that we did to narrow that market down to, potential market for our company, and then what that size of the prize is and what's our right to win it. And then when we narrow it down to specific markets that meet our thesis. And this has been put in some of our public information and we've talked this with analysts. That is the industrial model, so working with our current industrial customers and potential some middle mile cargo transportation systems and logistics networks. The other part is pure regional mobility cargo transportation, supporting a network perhaps in Northern Europe and other places. And then the third is back to using our core competencies and white labeling for a large 121 carrier to provide airport transportation. So we see those as the initial markets and within the scope of our theses, of course, industry cargo first, then moving into the potential passenger markets. We think that for Bristow, on a top line basis, by 2030, 2031 is somewhere between, I gotta be careful what I say here, I don't know how to put any forward looking statements, but a sizable material market for the business. On hundreds of aircraft. I mean, it is public that we have placed orders for approximately 450 odd aircraft with the different, equipment manufacturers. We have put in capital now with some of those manufacturers, cause they've hit certain milestones in their processes. So we're on the road to doing that. We're looking at potential additional milestones met by this year. And we also believe that there's a potential that we could operate a small scale, electric aircraft, sometime this year or early next, and then potentially on the cargo side, early next year. Early aircraft in 2025.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, how has the market changed from two years ago?

Another thing that surprised me is I had expected more exits from the industry or consolidation. I was very pleased to see the Joby XWing consolidation. I'd like to potentially see more of that. There's just not enough capital that's going to be available for investment to meet this, the size of all the companies that are trying to enter into this market. So we're going to have to see that scale down. So I did expect more exits. I was somewhat surprised early on by Volocopter's, issue with the German government not being able to get the loan guarantees. I think that as the early investors, the SPACs have been done, the private equities coming, and it's not necessarily going to be there. You're going to need more government support, specifically the European companies. Whereas in the United States, I think that's the, Air Force program has helped really substantiate and validate the, equipment and provided a level of some revenue to support their operations. Those are the big surprises for me. I guess some people may say, are you not surprised by some of the delays in certification? I'm certainly not. We've built our models around potential aircraft moving out to the right. I also, and I said this today at Revolution Aero, it's not just the aircraft certification that's going to get delayed, but in my entire history of buying aircraft and delivering aircraft as a salesperson, I can't think of too many times we actually did it on time. There are always delays. People have robust schedules. They put them in place. So you have to build that resilience. So I'm certainly not surprised by the delays. I'm encouraged by it. I've also been encouraged by the latest, Advisor Circular that the FAA published recently, that aligns more with the EASA and gives some better direction on the vehicle certification and some of the other aspects of it. So not surprised, but very happy to see that. Really changes in the organization, no consolidation, no major exits to speak of, as surprised me for sure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What technology OEM operator has been the most significant positive surprise in the last year or so?

They are developing some vehicles, Lockheed is certainly, and Lockheed's an investor in a few others, but I've been surprised to not see them either make an acquisition and or announce a major development in this space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any change to advice you'd give to entrepreneurs that you gave, in your last podcast?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I'd stick with picks and shovels. I would stick with that. I think that's still important. Make deals with, at this point in space, if you want to get into, into this space, I would, think about how you can be a supplier to the industry, the OEMs. And then a little later, well, in line with that, the drone deliveries and the beyond visual on a slide is accelerating. I think there's really good opportunities there for entrepreneurs that are willing to step into that space. And that's something I think you can do. And then others that are willing to maybe wait a little bit longer, infrastructure investment. Infrastructure in real estate, infrastructure in communication, navigation systems, in data processing and data aggregation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I know that you've listened to a lot of our podcasts.

And, everybody on, on your podcast generally smarter than me. my favorite is going to be John Langford. For personal reasons, one, I, I think that, one, he's within our portfolio and, one of the companies that we're really, hopeful for with Electra. Aero. Two, he's just a force of this industry with such a proven track record, and he's also influenced many of your other podcast people that have been on. They've either worked with him or worked for him within his team. And he's really spread his knowledge across the industry that, it's difficult to replicate and absolutely necessary. So I view as somebody that I would love to be able to emulate in any way, shape, or form. So hearing him speak about not what he's, just not what he's doing about this AAM industry, but is what he's doing potentially for STEM operations and his investments in things to get young people interested in aviation.

And why not using drones for this kind of operations? It can be cheaper with drones, more sustainable. So it's now about delivery inside the port and outside, for example to the anchor area where ships are waiting for entering the port. When a ship is sailing to the port, for example, an oil tanker, before they transfer the oil to a terminal you have to take some samples to check the quality. Nowadays the ship will enter the port, will go to the terminal, people will go on the ship, will take the samples, will drive with the car to the laboratory, do the checks, and they know if it's okay or not to start a procedure for transferring. We're now looking into why don't we fly with a drone to the ship who's already sailing to the port, not yet inside of the port, but sailing to the port, take the sample, fly to the laboratory, and do the check. When the ship is sailing into the terminal, we know the outcome and we can directly start with transferring the oil into the terminal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our discussion with Niels Kalshoven, Head of Drone Innovation Program at Port of Rotterdam and Co-founder Drone Port Rotterdam.

So after we heard about the port of Rotterdam from Andrew, we were curious to know what they are specifically doing today and intend to do with drones and other advanced air mobility, as well as hear how their current and anticipated operations apply potentially to other ports in Europe and around the world. So we went right to the source to today's guest Niels Kalshoven. Listen to a Niel's describes the use case at the port of Rotterdam, the implementation and value of U-space, the policies and procedures put in place to ensure a safe operation and the volume of operations today, and what's anticipated in the future. This is a really interesting business model; it'll be interesting to see what type of service eventually scales at port operations. Will the ports allow their customers to operate drones independently with some type of centralized command and control, or will ports provide some type of centralized service? Whereby the port customer's contract for drone services with that centralized organization? We generally see both models with airports today where some airports allow their customers let's say airlines to operate independently, or in some cases, especially outside the United States, there are more centralized provision of services like centralized gate or ramp management. We hope you enjoy this talk with Niels. It's great to hear how trailblazers are establishing drone operations, how they justify their efforts and spend and how they see the real value in return from the operations of the future. Niels thanks for joining us and to our listeners we hope you enjoy our talk with Neils Kalshoven as you innovate and The Vertical Space. Niels Kalshoven is the Head of Drone Innovation Program at the Port of Rotterdam and Co-founder DronePort Rotterdam. The use of drones is in line with the strategic ambition of the Port of Rotterdam Authority to be an even safer, more sustainable and more efficient port. Within the port Niels is responsible to develop the port area into an area where providers of drone services can experiment in a relevant environment. In the hybrid port of the future drones be used in addition to vessels, trains, and trucks for the transport of freight and passengers. Niels welcome to The Vertical Space. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you very much for the invitation. Looking forward to this discussion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. So if I look to the, urban air mobility, and people, agree with me is that I think that if you look at the technique, it's quite far. But if you look at the regulations, there's still some work to do before we get really into the operational flying with the drones in the air, in ports or cities or wherever you think about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Niels, you're saying is that the operationalizing of the drones is potentially further out than what most people think?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, I think so. Especially if you look, to our port, the port of Rotterdam, it's quite busy at this moment. Already now, I think two and a half year, we're looking into this kind of new industry. And what you see nowadays that the amount of operations are still, increasing. So it's quite busy in our port area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right, then I'm going to challenge your comment just a bit here. So what you're saying is, that although drone operations may have a while to scale the way people are generally expecting, at your port, the drone operations are pretty much at volume. They're operating relatively well, which is, a pretty darn good drone use case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Yes, it is. So especially if you look at the regulation nowadays, it's all VLOS or eVLOS. So you have to see the drone flying. But still, I think we now have 50 to 60 commercial drone operators who are flying for our customers in the port. If you look one and a half years ago, it was only 15. So it's quite increasing in those, is it one and a half years, so to say?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Niels, give us a little bit of a background. So you're actually a port guy, right? You're not necessarily a drone person. So this is a little bit different for us. Okay. Tell us a little bit about, Port operations and how the operation of a port sets up the potential need for drone operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so if you look at the port of Rotterdam, it's a quite big port. It's the biggest in Europe, not the biggest in the world anymore. But still we have 42 kilometers long is the port and we have 3, 000 customers which are located there. If you look at the port operations, formerly we are a landlord, so we lease our land to our customers. This is one of our income and the other one is port use. So when a ship is entering the port, they pay an amount of money, for using all the, services from the port. So what you see nowadays that there's a lot of logistic going on the, in the ports. A lot of goods are transported inside of the port, but also outside to the inland or to the short sea, to other ports in the neighborhood like Antwerp or Hamburg, for example. And what you see is with the drone industry, it's quite new for us as well. It's already there, but there are many questions. How can you use these drone operations in these kind of port environments? So that is what we're now looking into in several use cases. How we can involve or implement this in the current situations, so to say.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Before going into some specific use cases, do you mind telling the story of how you got started with drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so it started two, I think two to three years ago, when we saw that there was a new development about drones and it was first, it was the very small ones and we started to, within our innovation department, and, yeah. Let's start with the intro of the investigation of that. So we spoke also to our board and they said, yeah, drones, drones is something our neighbor is playing in the garden. And that was our vision at that moment. But we thought that it was, the development goes very fast. We say, okay, if you, look into the future and see the increase in the number of operations in the port. We as a port authority should think something about that, have an opinion about that. Do we like that? Do we disagree with that? Do we want to have a specific role in the ports as a port authority in this industry? So that was the beginning when we started with this, research, which is still going on, but that was the beginning when we started to look into these operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So this was an internally driven effort. It wasn't the fact that drone companies came to you and tried to pitch the ideas, but it was more of a internally grown innovation project. Is that correct? Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But indeed also, drone operators asked to our authority for what is the regulations here? Can I fly here in a port area? At that moment, we didn't have any answers. So that was also a trigger to start into those investigations about the industry. So when you\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>when you started this, you know, a couple of years ago, what was the, primary, areas of concern or things that was top of your mind? Was it related to regulations? Was it related to the fact that perhaps the characteristics of existing drones were not adequate enough, or perhaps they were, was it about, the decision of whether we, hire somebody to do this or do we in house this capability? What were some of the main things that you were juggling as you were trying to decide whether this makes sense?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We ensure that all the drones were flying above the ports, that it will be done in a safe way. So do we have to regulate it or, do we need some extra regulations, inside of the port because it's all critical infrastructure. But it's also about security. Do you want those drones in your area? Sometimes you want them because customers are using it for inspections purposes. But it can also be that we have non cooperative drones in the port with other purposes we don't like. So those were the first topics that we say, okay, about safety and security, that's very important. We want it to be the safest part in the world. So with these new developments, you need an answer on your questions. And we didn't have the knowledge at that time. So what we said, let's start, gathering all the information, getting the knowledge, to know where we get talking about that you have information to where you can base your decision on. So that was very important in the beginning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so did you see drones as a way to expand the offering to your customers as another revenue source for the port, or was it about enabling the customers to bring their own drones and then operate them as they see fit?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the Port of Rotterdam, it's really enabling. We do not, build up our own services for our customers. So we are more enabling the environment to say, okay, the drone operators can fly in the ports for our customers. So we really want to facilitate that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see. Okay. So you don't, directly contract with drone operators and have them fly on behalf of the port, but you are providing an environment infrastructure, whether this is U- space or otherwise that we'll get into later that lets those, 3000 plus customers hire those drone operators and service providers and help them in whatever they need or they want done.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, exactly. Of course, we also look into the drone operations for our own organizations. But if you look at our customers, it's an open market. They are free to choose any operator they want. Of course, if you look at the port area, it's a specific category, so you need extra regulations to fly over there. But indeed it's open, so you can choose every company you want, national or international, that's up to the customers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's the need for the drones. What's the, and what's the use case for the drones? What are they doing today that was done by some other means three plus years ago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what you see nowadays, it's, already said it's all EVLOS BVLOS is not, yet there. The regulations aren't in the Netherlands for enough fly BVLOS. That will, I think, take a couple of years. What you see nowadays is that a lot of inspection is done by drones. Inspection of infrastructure, chemical industries, plants, cranes, all different kinds of things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's inspection and surveillance at the port. Where previously it was done by what means.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It was done by people. For example, if you look at the infrastructure, the cranes, the inspection of cranes, and look at the current status of the maintenance, it was done by people. And it took them maybe a week to build the structure, to get it to the cranes, do the inspections, get all the pictures, a video maybe, and then do also the analysis. And what you see nowadays that they use the drones, it is flying, for example, one time or several times around the building or the crane, using the camera, using the algorithms, AI solutions to also predict the maintenance. for example, they will do it first for a baseline and every month, for example, and they will do an update and they can, after several times, they can predict the maintenance. That's very interesting. So it's cheaper because it's less labor, but also you're more efficient in using, drones, for example.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And this is the infrastructure that the port owns, right? So in this case, you're using the drones to inspect your own assets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also, but it's also from our customers, for example, the container terminals, there are independent companies. What you see is that they're responsible for their own cranes and inspections, responsible for their own operations. And they do also, use drones for the inspections purposes. And if you look at ports, we also have, for example, bridges, or other infrastructures, trains, railways. There we also use drones for inspections. So it's both for our customers are using it, but also the port authority is using it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what is the primary, benefit or value that either the port or the customers see? In this case, let's take using drones for inspection and surveillance. Is the value realized in much, less time spent on doing these things, or is the value in having more frequent inspections and therefore predictive, interventions and maintenance, and therefore you save money over a longer period of time. Or is it something else? When you were going through the business case for these drones. Where did you see the value? How quickly and how strongly does that ROI resonate?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's always in combination. So indeed, you're more efficient in, doing, it quicker. So that's, related to the price cheaper. But also if you look to the safety, when you have to build a structure to inspect a crane with, and people have to get up to the structure,\\ it's, I think, also safer to use a drone instead of. So it's a combination of, time management, efficiency, in the duration and also safety. And that's makes it cheaper to use drones in these, topics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the trade offs? You mentioned things that you gain by using drones. What are the things that you sacrifice a little bit? Is it perhaps the, human touch, if we can call it that, of a knowledgeable worker that can, identify things better than perhaps machines at this point, or is it something else? What I'd like to, bring up in this conversation is what it was like convincing management to roll this out. What were the, concerns raised? What was that back and forth discussion? Obviously you mentioned security and safety, and then on the benefit side, saving time, being more efficient, saving, lives potentially, but, can we get a little bit deeper into how that calculus looked like for the port.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A very good question. We don't always have the figures yet, but if you look at it from the customer point of view, it's for them always about, do it in a cheaper way or in a safer way. If you look at as a port authority, for us, it's very important that when people are flying in the ports, it will be done on the safe way. So it's another point of view, so to say, if you look to our customers or the port authority. At the end, I think one of the most important things is indeed safety. That it's for all people. It has to be done on a safe way and a secure way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What changes to existing processes were required when you introduced drones into the workflow?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:43\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so we looked indeed to the processes and the procedures. We're now looking into, we started the proof of concept for a U- space airspace. When they start to fly, they will fill in a flight request. So for now we know who's flying in the air. And that's quite a new procedure. If you look for a couple of years ago, there was none of them. So at least we know that. Those are quite new for us as well. So we formally, we're specialized in traffic management on the water. Now we're also looking to the air. So all those, procedures and processes, which are important for that, those are quite new for a port authority, maybe not so for an airport, but for a port authority, it's quite new. So that was quite a challenge for us also because, sometimes you fly above and the container, terminal, okay. Then a drone falls down on a container. That's not so exciting. Of course, there can be some damage on your drone, but not on the container. If you compare it to a chemical industry, that can be very, dangerous if you look to the dangerous goods. We're still looking in of all those kinds of procedures, what kind of, risk, mitigations must be taken into account for a container terminal or in chemical industry or, flying above, water, for example, ships. Those are quite new for us and we're still looking at several of those procedures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about procedures on the enterprise side of, let's say, teams that inspect assets, whether those are cranes or railroads, chemical plants, or any other infrastructure in the port that the port owns. How did their workflow change from, previous iteration or version of manually collecting the data, maybe taking some pictures and then uploading those pictures into some ERP like system that then tracks over time, the state of this infrastructure. How did that change with the drones and were there any required updates to those systems in order to accommodate drones in this workflow.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so I don't have the knowledge of the really in depth and the detail procedures from what of our customers, what I can say is that what you see is that they're now collecting a lot of data, so that is something different in the way of working. So when they're using a lot of AI algorithms to process all this data. And get also good results of all their images and the cameras they, or the images they get into the system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you talked about inspection and surveillance. What other use cases are prominent today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what we're now looking into is also several use cases. One is, for example, delivery. Delivery of packages inside of the port, but also outside. For example, we have a customer, who's now bringing 130 packages daily to ships and is doing it with boats, very small speed boats. And, yeah, why do you, why not using drones for that, this kind of operations? It's, it can be cheaper with drones. It can more sustainable. That's also very important topic. so it's now about delivery inside the port and outside, for example, to the anchor area where, ships are waiting, for entering the port. That's very interesting for us, but also, for example, when a ship is, sailing to the port, for example, an oil tanker. Before they transfer the oil to a terminal, you have to take some samples to check the quality. And those samples first has to go to the laboratory to do the checks. So nowadays the ship will enter the port, and will go to the terminal. Then and, people will go on the board, on the ship, will take the samples will drive with the car to the laboratory, do the checks, and they know if it's okay or not to start a procedure for transferring the oil. We're now looking into why don't we fly with a drone to the ship who's already sailing to the port, not yet inside of the port, but sailing to the port, take the sample, fly to the laboratory, and do the check. When the ship is sailing, into the terminal, we know the outcome and we can directly start with transferring the oil into the terminal. It's like more, if you look in a port, it's about the port optimization. How can you help that and make it more efficient and faster, and that the ship can transfer the oil and after that go directly to the next port. So that's very interesting for us as well. another use case is looking to eVTOLs. For example, when a crew is, has to be changed. For now, all tech, they will go off the ship and drive the taxis to the airport. Why don't we use air taxis for that? Because we don't have any public transportation over there. Another topic can be that our fire department in the port is fairly sophisticated and is already using drones, when the ship is on fire. They've, if the ship is on sea, they will fly with helicopters to the ships and their equipment is, they have a lot of equipment. It's too big to put it as well on the helicopter. So you need another helicopter. Why don't you use a very big cargo drone to fly the equipment to the ship and the fire department to go fight the helicopter? So those are the next, use cases we are looking into and yeah, can make a difference for a port, not only for the port authority, but for our customers, as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>90 percent of the drone operations are for infrastructure inspections.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exactly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And they're operated, help me clarify this with Luka's good questions, and they're operated by one of the 3, 000 customers of the port.

Very good. and if I could, and you spelled out many use cases for, let's say, AAM. So drones, you talked about larger cargo drones, you talked about, eVTOL, and again, for our audience, you're not a drone guy, you are a port guy. And you're saying, we used to, and historically, we never had to worry about the air, or to manage the air. Talk a little bit more about that. Tell us about how you were first introduced to it, what software you used to manage that process, who are the people who operate it, and how easy is it to operate, and what are some of the challenges there?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. To manage the, the very low airspace, we're now looking in, uSpace airspace. That's, it's quite new for us as well. There is already some regulations for the, from the European Union but it's not in, implemented yet in, in the Netherlands. We still wanted to investigate what is U- space airspace and can that be a solution if you look at the increase of, drone operations in the ports? Not only the small one, but also the bigger one. And also, if you look into the BVLOS operations, then I think it will be very crowded in the air. And that's the reason we start this proof of concept, for two years. And what we really wanted to investigate is the USPACE airspace and solutions. So manage the very lower airspace below the 150 meters. Is that something, interesting for our ports area? And besides that, the second one is, we're now responsible for the water, but is the port authority also the one we should do this? Or is there some other authority who should be responsible for this? Those were the research questions when we started this project, because we didn't know what it was exactly. Then we said, okay, just let's do it. Let's make it happen and let's see what it brings to us. And, it's what you see nowadays is be selected, and, provider. And, they call it an UTM system. And, UTM\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Who's\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Who\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>is the provider, Niels?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The provider in this case is Airwayz. so they are the developer of the system and we are the operators of the system. So they are, they've developed the whole system and, from, and they have a background in the manned aviations and what you see nowadays, they focus on the unmanned aviations. And within that system, there are several services we, you can deliver, eh, for example, the traffic management, you get all the information, from all the drone operators. You can do the traffic management and you can say also, someone is already flying over here, please wait for several minutes, or do take another route. This is an alternative we can give you. So that's all in this system, and that's called the UTM, the Unmanned Aircraft System for Traffic Management.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>how do people, you know, file their plan and how do they get approved? And, what's this tactical and strategic deconfliction? Explain that process because our audience will love to hear the practical use case here that Andrew Hately talked a little bit about as well in his podcast.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. we have several, if you look at the solution of use, use USP, you have to integrate all the drone operators into the system. So the drone operator has his own command and control system for the fleet management, where they can control their drones. And we have the traffic management system. Our UTM. So what you want is that the drone operators, when they start, do the preparations for the flight, so the pre flight, they will, fill in a flight plan and ask for a specific route, for example, from A to B. And, we will look in the area if somebody is already flying there and so not, we approve the, the request and otherwise we will withdraw it. And when they get, approval, they can take off and flight from A to B because we have in direct integrations, we get also in the, in-flight or the telemetry. So anytime we know where the drone is flying, that's is also very, easy. If you looked, eh, into the UTM system, it's like an aerial picture. So what you see is what we have. All the drones will, applied with the fly plan. In the system we also have manned aviation we also have the AIS data. So those are the ships were sailing in the ports. And we're now we have also the non cooperative drones information. So there's several information\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is all integrated into the software, Niels.

That is, we're now looking into the last part is the non cooperative drones. But when we have that, we have a very nice aerial picture, and then you can say we have all the information in the lower airspace and can start with the really de conflicting of the drone in the drones. And that's very interesting. Maybe not for now, because it's all VLOS and eVLOS, but in this case it will learn a lot. We get a lot of information and we learn by day. how we, get into the de conflicting for the BVLOS flights. And also what you can do is, because you get all, a lot of statistics, data, you can also look to, okay, how we can mitigate the specific ground risk or air risk. So make it easier for our drone operators to fly it in our port. And that's very interesting as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Speaking of air risk and ground risk, can you go into a little bit more detail what level of air risk class and ground risk you are operating in and what is the resulting SAIL level?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if you look at the prototype we're now running, it's in G class. So we're close by the airport, Rotterdam The Hague airport. That's a controlled area. So to say the CTR, but we are looking outside of that. So where the area where you are doing the proof of concept is the G class. Because of the operations we have now, we don't have any SAIL 4 yet. It's all about SAIL 2, SAIL 3 some of them. and that's more or less, nowadays, but yeah, because it's still VLOS and EVLOS. But we're now looking into several operations, for example, the BVLOS, and we're now looking at looking in how we can get the drones into SAIL 4, for this and what do we need? What kind of data do we need for our regulators to convince them that it's secure and safe to fly, with these drones, and say, okay, with this information, we know at least it's safe to fly BVLOS in our area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see. maybe this is getting too much into the weeds, but I'm curious the ground risk, determination. Are ports considered a controlled ground area for purposes of classifying risk?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't have all the knowledge of that, I have to say, but I know that if you look at specific, ground risk, when a lot of people are walking there, Let's put it that way, the drone operator at the end is responsible to look into the ground risk and, has authorization from our authority to fly above certain area\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. And the reason I'm asking is because, you know, just by looking at how a safety case can be put forward in front of the regulators and the fact that it is a controlled ground, area where only the people who are involved are present and that you can, manage that ground risk, and also from a, air risk class sounds like, initially you're flying very close to infrastructure, you're, in an uncontrolled airspace, it seems like it would be already very fertile ground to be able to fly BVLOS, and I'm surprised why it hasn't happened yet in an environment like that, where you compare to, the drone delivery space, for instance, where BVLOS flights are happening over suburban areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's true. And that's, I think that's for, if you look to the port or to the Netherlands, that's one of our biggest, challenges, to convince our regulators that we can fly in a very safe way and that it can also be BVLOS. What we also try nowadays is because of the infrastructure we have and all the data and we want to try to, for example, the fire department to get the first one will fly BVLOS above water. And they are not a commercial one, so it's easier for them to do this kind of operations, and starts building up again all the data and convince our authority and regulators that it's very safe to do it in this way and that we have data that we convince them that, that you can fly BVLOS above water with these kind of data and infrastructure we supply nowadays.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>32:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned earlier that you think it'll take another couple of years until the National Aviation Authority is convinced and that before BVLOS flights can happen. And again, that strikes me as way too long and so what is it that, that the aviation authority in Netherlands is having an issue with, and are they trying to impose things that are above and beyond what's established and mandated by EASA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you compare it, for example, with autonomous cars, it's also the same in The Netherlands. The technique is there, the car is there, but the regulation isn't yet there. So they're mostly always behind. So that's the same what we see now in the drone industry as well. But anyway, what we see now is that the regulators See what we're now doing in not only in the Port of Rotterdam, but also in other cities or ports and they already get the trust that it's, we can do it in a very safe way. What you see nowadays that they are really keen to help us. And we now also will start a BVLOS corridor. which will start from the port of Rotterdam to a test center which is close by, 30 kilometers away. And, that's a really first start for us, to fly, several BVLOS operations, above, water. But I agree with you, it can always be, can always be faster. and I'm convinced that we, looking at what we have nowadays in infrastructure, digital, we can already start with some operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:28\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At some point, I'd love to cover the vision for how this operates at scale at the port and whether it's decentralized and you have 3, 000 different customers who are planning their flights and flying them as they see that they need to for their purposes and the IT system manages the safety of that. Or is it this highly centralized model and, why one versus the other?

And that is one of the questions, for a port authority. Is that something, we want to, let it up to the market, or is that something as a port authority you should want to do that? And that's a very interesting question and we don't have the answer yet. But what you see nowadays is that, for example, if you look to a USSP and you want to get several information layers in that, that sometimes, speaking as a port authority, we have more information than other parties will have. And we're not always allowed to share those information because of the authority we are. So it's also a very interesting question is if we can provide a port authority the services and other commercial parties can also, will be there a difference in services quality and also in, in costs? Is there a price differences in the future as well? And also to the price discussion, it's very interesting and also a very big question mark, because for now we know about what the, we invest in all the infrastructure, but what the model will be, the business model of using USpace Airspace. So will you charge all the drone operators or not? We don't have an answer yet. that's a very big question mark. And we know that we will have to charge them because if you use the infrastructure and etc, maybe it can, for us, it can be breakeven or do you want to make some money on that as a commercial party? So those are very interesting topics as well.

I can imagine we already started doing some research, but it's also depending if you only fly in the port, what is happening if you cross the USpace airspace. So those are several scenarios you can write down and say, okay, what then, what should I charge the drone operator? And I have to be honest, I really don't know yet.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you talk to customers or operators, what kind of feedback are you receiving?

On one hand, it's people who are selling drones to the independent operators that are running them today, which is, relatively peanuts. If you are going to charge for something, Niels, you're charging for access to the airspace, I'm assuming, is what you're charging for. And in the future, you may be charging for a service. Whereas Peter's question was getting to, you may provide a centralized service rather than having thousands of people running their individual drones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you look at it as a port authority and looking at the port area, I think, but that's my personal opinion, I think I would prefer a centralized service. So everyone knows how much it will cost to fly in the port or cross the port and then it's very because we have so many people who want to fly over there and you have to organize or orchestrate in a way that you are still attractive and that you're not charging too much to your customers, that you're not attractive anymore as a port in a broader perspective. So it's, we want to have it at least in a safe way. It's the same if we look at the traffic information on water. You want that it will be done in a safe way and it, you need infrastructure for that and our customers understand they have to pay for it. Yeah. question is indeed, do you have to make a lot of money for that? And that's not always the case for us. As a port authority, I think it's more interested that we have more customers here, who bring their businesses here. And that's more valuable for us than making money out of these kinds of services.

They're not allowed to, have heavier cargo. That's the regulations. And if you look at the cargo, it's very interesting.

So what in the transportation nowadays is it's under the five kilogram or something like that. Of course, we're looking to the next step is the heavier cargo drones. And when it's allowed also to fly with those kind of drones, up to 25, payload kilogram, for example, then you will also see the bigger cargo will also be, delivered. So it's a little bit depending of what is possible, and, nowadays and what is allowed nowadays. and, yeah. And if you see that it's allowed to also transport bigger cargo, then I think that will also be, that will also increase.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you talk to your customers or for purposes of your own drone operations as well, what are some of the frustrations that you have with current drones?

I think if you look at the products nowadays, I think it's about the distance you can fly, the time the drone can be in the air. And that, of course, is dependent of the batteries. For now, it's all about batteries nowadays. You already see that they also look to the hydrogen, of course, or in combination, hybrid. But I think nowadays it's the combination of, the duration you can fly in the air.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any interesting insights or feedback from when you're talking to customers how they think about whether to outsource drone services to an operator or whether given the volumes, it makes sense for them to develop that capability in house?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A very good question, because it's also depending on what their core business is. If you look to the example where we talked about the customers who is doing the deliveries nowadays, is for the 130 packages a day, is looking into, okay, let's start with outsource it. And maybe in the future he will insource it because it's then it's part of his core business. And that's really interesting because if you look to, for example, container terminals, we want to have some inspection of their cranes. Those will always say I will use a drone, a commercial drone operator who will do the inspection because, otherwise I don't fly too often. It will cost me too many time, too many, investments to get all, and also in, in labor with all the training, et cetera. It costs too much to do it by yourself. And then they outsource it. So it's really depending of the, the industry where you're in and the purposes you want drones for, for inspection or delivery or whatever. Because I can also imagine if you have cargo delivery daily, for example, the samples we already talked about, yeah, then it can be very interesting to do it by yourself. So depending on what kind of business you are in.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you extrapolate into the future, how do you see this dynamic evolving, at least for your port?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think a lot of inspections still will be done by, commercial drone operators, also because they are specialized, they have the equipment, they have the AI tools, the algorithms can do the analysis.

I would assume with the use cases you're describing, there'd be an awful lot of ports that are going to have a lot of drone operations in the future. Or do you see it only in, one or two in Europe, in New York, L. A., who knows, in the United States, Hong Kong?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think if you look at Europe, I see a lot of ports starting, investigating how they can use drones in the port. Some ports are farther, some will just start. If you look to, for example, the biggest one, Hamburg, Antwerp, Rotterdam, looking these kind of operations, they also look into U- space, airspace, or, how, manage the, the, the lower airspace, offering special services as an authority. We're not the only one and every port has its own approach. what, which is good because what you see nowadays, we speak to Antwerp, we speak to Hamburg, and that's very interesting because we say, okay, we do it on our own way. We implement U- space airspace in an operational area. Antwerp has a different approach and we can learn both from both sides. That's very interesting. So what we do nowadays, what we wanted to do is that we are building up our own ecosystem in the Port of Rotterdam. They are doing it as well in Antwerp, Hamburg as well. And we want to connect all those ecosystems and exchange the data, exchange knowledge, and how can we help each other in that. So that is what you see in Europe. Outside of Europe, we also see the same is happening. For example, Singapore is also looking into this kind of operations. We have a good relationship as well with them. And, also looking into how can we help each other? How can we exchange data and knowledge? But the difference on also of the location of the port, the country it is in, what kind of port, industry is there, how far they are with their developments.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of those ports, whether in Europe or Singapore, as you mentioned, which are the most forward leaning, which are, being the most innovative and doing the most interesting things\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a very good question. yeah, Rotterdam is one of, in, in the top five, but, uh, if you look at the approach we have looking into the uSpace airspace, how we develop services for our customers, how we build up the ecosystem, so how we help our customers, and look into their business models to implement these kind of operations. So that's something we don't see a lot in other ports. That's really our frontrunner over there. But if you look at other ports, for example, Antwerp, they already implemented the whole, uSpace, airspace, and also the BVLOS operations. They have five or six drones in the box solutions and can start the operations at any time they want. That's not so far we are yet. So on the other point of view, they're also very far, but sometimes it's very difficult to compare it. So what you can say is that there is sometimes in a port, there is a lot of development going on. And sometimes they just started. They're not so far, so it's not about who is the best, I think, it's how far they are in the implementation and building up the ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there roadblocks that these early innovators have discovered that the rest of the community is thinking about how to work around, or are the ports that are being the most forward leaning, learning on their own and benefiting a lot from it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think, there are some advantages of, and, what we already, for example, if you look to several systems for detecting drones, In Belgium, Antwerp, they have another system than in Hamburg, Singapore, Port of Rotterdam.

So we invite each other as well to look into our kitchen, so to say, and so they can see how we implemented that. So that, and that is very interesting as port, because we also have, they all have the same challenges in implementing this new kind of industry.

I would assume there's probably 10 to 20 that would be the best candidates. But why would small ports not even want this service, Niels?

I think the only thing is what you see nowadays in the bigger ports. they also have the capability to invest in these kinds of new solutions. So they are more the front runner. And they can help also the smaller ports in these kind of things. And also the bigger ports are more, they have more complex operations. And if it works over in these kind of ports, you can copy and paste it also in the smaller ports. So that's the very interesting thing. So at the end, I think any ports can copy paste a part of our solutions, not the port of Rotterdam solutions, but the solutions from the, from any port where you're looking into. So I think the opportunity and it's quite big. And, I think there is a lot to do with imports and also looking into how we can implement these kinds of solutions, because it also helps us with the logistics and make it more efficient, more sustainable. we all have the same challenges over there.

So what we want to know is who's flying in the air. So that was also one of the reasons we started with the U- space airspace. That brings us also that we have to track the non cooperative drones as well. And, that's what we now do it nowadays. And what you see is that, sometimes it's because people don't know, they're not allowed to fly over there. And sometimes they have other purposes for example, if you look to our own container terminals, we have a lot of, drugs related things that's going on over there. And they also use drones nowadays to get packages from the one side of the fence to the other side of the fence. And then we also have the other side of that's more like the terrorist, thing. We know that we have to invest in these kinds of solutions. And that it's very important to know what is happening in the air. And as a Port Authority, we're only about the detecting. We cannot, do anything about, the next step, get them out of the air. That's something for the police in this case, in our case. So we now also talk to the National Police about, well, we have this kind of data and how can we help you to give the insights of what is happening in our port area.

I'm about to ask you 10 years from now, what are we going to be seeing? And to allow you to think about that, I'm assuming there's a bit of a business opportunity here, for some kind of a service delivery, capability that again takes the best practices of what you're doing in the other European ports and others and that just takes it from port to port and maybe you guys are part of that maybe you're part owner in that but it sounds like there's a real opportunity there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A lot of opportunities is going on. What we also now are doing that we are building up the ecosystem. That is not only done by the port. It's also done by the national authorities. For example, the municipality of Rotterdam, which is close by. We have Rotterdam The Hague Airport. It's close by. We have the province. That's region authority. We have the TU Delft. We several universities. And also research institutions. And what we see is that we have to integrate all those, parties together. And that's the reason we now also started a foundation that's called the DronePort Rotterdam. And from that foundation we really want to get all the knowledge together, work as a one ecosystem. And spread it out. Not only in the Netherlands, but also, international, working with other ports or cities. And that's a great opportunity for us. So we're now focusing a lot of how can we manage it inside of the port, but within a couple of years, I think it's very interesting also to bring our knowledge and experience outside of our port to other ports or cities, which are now facing these kind of challenges. That's, we're now looking in, we're now in, in the phase of, formalize it, the foundation. So that will be there, I think, in a couple of weeks or months. and from that point, we can start also, the cooperation with other, parties.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>if you were to do this all over again, you've been doing it for a couple of years What would you do different?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the differences?

If you look at all the safety inputs there, they are as safe as, if not better than, Part 121 air carriers. And the whole system is under attack now, because lo and behold, the Part 121 regulation was designed to favor the incumbent, and to really keep out innovation in this space.

In today's episode was sit down with Uma Subramanian, a seasoned aviation expert with a wealth of experience in industry. Having known Uma for many years, we've been really eager to bring her insights to our audience. From her time as an engineer, working on F-18s to doing corporate development and strategy at Rolls Royce, to leading the urban air mobility network Voom, an Airbus company to being the founding CEO of Aero, an airline catering to premium passengers from March 2019 to September 2023, Uma truly brings a unique perspective to the table. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics from the genesis of Aero and the economics of running an airline to the challenges and opportunities in the ever evolving aviation industry. One particularly contentious topic that we explore is the ongoing debates surrounding Part 135 and Part 380 regulations sparked by the success and recent public discourse around JSX. Throughout our discussion, we delve into the intricacies of airline operations, exploring questions, such as the right strategies for profitable growth, the role of labor in shaping airline policies and the regulatory structures that either hinder or foster innovation in air travel. We also touch upon the exciting developments in electric aviation, and the potential for regional air services in the U.S. shedding light on the future of aviation and the path forward for industry innovation. Uma is the managing director of Surya Ventures, a mobility advisory firm. From 2019 through 2023, Uma was the CEO of Aero Technologies, a next generation air carrier for the experience economy. Prior to launching Aero, Uma was the founding CEO of Voom.Flights an Airbus company, which ran on demand air taxi services in Sao Paulo and Mexico City. Uma holds an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan and an MBA from Harvard Business School. Uma is passionate about flight and has spent the majority of her career working in aerospace and aviation. Uma believes that this is an extraordinary time in the industry and looks forward to building the future of flight. So join us as we unpack the complexities of starting and running an airline, navigate the economics of air travel and explore the fascinating intersection of innovation and regulation in aviation, right after a brief sponsor message.

And I believe that it is possible to do something radically different. And I believe it's possible to do something radically different while building a profitable business.

So, my history and passion for aviation go way back. I went to space camp when I was nine and became obsessed with all things aviation and aerospace. I have an undergrad degree in aerospace engineering, and right outta college, worked on the F 18 program doing stress engineering in the aft fuselage, which if you know me is not a good career choice. I am, not the engineer's engineer, so quite quickly I pivoted, and managed to finagle my way onto what was then Project Constellation, which was, the US' Moon Mars program. And I spent three sort of very happy years building or articulating a future for space travel, that, that was very exciting. It was about how does, how do we tend to send people to the moon? How do we send people to Mars? What is the right crew mix look like? And so had a really deep and intrinsic look at the space industry. And what I concluded there was that, space is really amazing, but things take a really long time. So I went to business school, and had some exposure into how do you make, how do people make decisions about what businesses to start and why. and found myself realizing that if ever I wanted to do something that moved at pace in the aerospace sector, it would have to be in aviation. And aviation is at the cutting edge, and very real to customers today. So I worked for Rolls Royce, in the military engine business and then, After a few kind of loops went and worked at Airbus where I started Airbus's first urban air mobility business, which was a network business that moved people in helicopters as a precursor to the urban air mobility revolution and learned in that process about how do you make money in the aviation space. And so when you were talking about the aviation space and, it becomes quite clear that you must be the operator to make money in aviation. there is very little margin for a network player. And so in March of 2019, I met Garrett Camp, who is the founder of Uber. And Garrett said to me, I want to do something in aviation. I believe fundamentally that the commercial air travel experience sucks and private's unaffordable. and I wanna start something. now Garrett had the experience of Uber, and was very interested in doing something asset light. And having had the experience at Airbus of running an asset light helicopter network, I made the point to him that you must be the operator in order for any of these models to work because the value accrues to the operator. And so with that as a thesis, we started, we built a super premium semi private brand, called Aero, that was about delivering a radically better passenger experience with economics that made sense. So we took Embraer Regional Jets, which had fallen out of favor with the commercial carriers, stripped them down to 16 seats, and started operating on, on routes, both in the US and in Europe. Now in, in aviation timing is everything. so we launched an airline six months before COVID and Brexit and financial crisis. so I genuinely believe that we managed to build something, despite the sort of really strong headwinds. and there is a very interesting model here because what we discovered is that there is a segment of people that really do care about the air travel experience, and there is an opportunity to build something that is radically better but you have to be really deliberate in how you do that, and what routes you choose, and how you go to market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you looked at space and you looked at aerospace overall, and you saw that aviation is where the excitement is and where you wanted to spend your time. And then you started looking at aviation and then you saw that being the operator is the way to be able to make the money. Can you talk a little bit about the economics of that? Why the operator and how did you reach that conclusion?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And even before that, Uma, if you don't mind clarifying what exactly you mean by running a network as opposed to being an operator.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>you, Luka.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so, there is a popular thesis that percolates around Silicon Valley every five or ten years, where if you go and look at any small regional airport, there's a lot of jets sitting on the ground. And what is a thesis that just keeps popping up is, Hey, I see a lot of excess capacity and I can make that capacity available in a way that allows, so I will build a network, right? So this was the Jetspotter model and operate other people's airplanes and allow them to operate profitably. This is the Blade model where they work with operators to run their network.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>and The challenge with that is that the economics in that don't really make sense, right? So the cost per hour to operate an aircraft comes down the more hours you fly. And so as the operator, you are, and this is why airlines sweat their assets, right? so an average airline will operate its asset between 3600 and 4000, hours a year per asset. But Charter operators only fly 400 to 800 hours, which is why charter flights are so expensive on a per hour basis, because they're covering their costs. And the thesis around, like, putting those charter operators in service more through a network play, basically implies that you can build a cost structure that's more efficient. But time and time again, what people have found is is that's actually really difficult to do because there is a, there's a ceiling on willingness to pay on a per hour basis that makes the economics not quite sort out. Does that answer the question?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So that answered the question a little bit of the operator versus the network, I guess, but I'm also assuming you're saying vis a vis the OEM as well, you're saying that this is where the money is versus being an OEM is my guess, is what you're saying. Is that right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, those are radically different businesses. and so being an OEM, so I'm talking purely about the air operations space. So how do you make money with assets once you already have them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, great. So, and can you just talk a little more detail about the economics of being the operator that brought you to your conclusion?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so, an operator, has classic fixed and variable costs, right? And the fixed costs are the depreciation of the aircraft, labor is often a fixed cost, insurance is a fixed cost on a per aircraft basis. and so you, you go through the stack bar build up on the fixed costs, and then the variable costs are really important. So there's also variable labor. there is fuel, which is a big one, and on a per flight hour basis, and then there's a maintenance reserve, which you carry on a per flight hour basis. So when you have many more hours over which to spread your fixed cost, your cost on a per hour basis can weigh out. And so if you don't operate your asset that much, you have to cover those fixed costs on, over 400 hours, right? And that tends to be the biggest driver.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so when you were running VOOM, as that, first experience with an operator, was VOOM exclusively operating its own aircraft or were you running a network and had some other operators on that network or was it a hybrid approach?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>VOOM was exclusively just the network. So that's a great example. So, the VOOM cost stack shook out as, on a 100 ticket. So say a passenger pays, we operated in Sao Paulo, Mexico City. So say a passenger were to pay 100 to fly from Guadalupe Airport to Itaim. So, Seventy five of those dollars went to the operator. Fifteen dollars went to the helipads at either side. About another five dollars went to air traffic control in Sao Paulo. And then the last five dollars is the margin that the network has. And a lot of times that margin is even less. So if you look at the cases of like JetSmarter, or, or some of the bigger network plays that didn't work out, BlackJet, DayJet. When I started Aero I had a long list of like dead players in this space. Often times there wasn't margin for the network, which is why that model doesn't work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, what were the key learnings you took from the VOOM experience that proved the most helpful and relevant as you, were building Aero?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Steve Jobs had that phrase, you can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking back. When I look back, I couldn't have done Aero without having done Voom, because I didn't know how to build an operation, right? And going through the VOOM experience and working with operators and really, like, learning about the pieces that needed to come together, taught me how to go build an air operation, right? Like, I knew that I needed to go out and get a Part 135 ticket. I know I needed to go out and file for Part 380 in order to have commercial authority to fly in the U. S. What post holders you need and how to actually go do that. How do you procure an aircraft and like, do go through all those things. And that's what I learned getting to this, getting to the point where we started Aero.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you started out with Aero, did you have one vision for, how it would grow profitably and what would be the right strategy? and did the experience, slightly change that or change that in some big ways as you got deeper into it and began operations with Aero? What came out of that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So, so Aero is still running. It is, serving passengers between Los Angeles and Cabo and Aspen, profitably. And when we started out, we had a huge vision to bring Semi private premium air travel to both Europe and the U. S. and they always say like if you had a do over, what would you do? And I think I would do less. I think what I learned building Aero is that it's really important to focus and like really nail it in one geography, and go from there. But you know, we got a lot of things right. We built a wonderful product. We had, we had five airplanes with 16 seats in them. That was a beautiful experience. and we found some routes that had a lot of traction. in hindsight, there's some routes that make a lot of sense, like New York, South Florida is a route that is a really compelling premium travel route. There's a lot of opportunities, sort of Canada, South Florida, up and down the eastern seaboard is really compelling. The West Coast has different travel patterns, and oftentimes you need longer range, so I probably would have started on the East Coast, with the airplanes that I had. But there's very clearly a market for the premium traveler that needs to be addressed in a different way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So your conclusions from your earlier work led you to believe that there's an opportunity in aviation, there's an opportunity to be the operator, and, your next professional Step forward was you're trying to prove out this opportunity. Let me ask you, who today is taking advantage of what you see as the greater opportunities in the market? What kind of operators?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I think that, so JSX is doing a really nice job on, the, the, Medium premium market, right? So not the wealthy end of the market, but the sort of large bell curve around like the middle class, with discretionary income traveler, right? and it's doing a really nice job of delivering to that person a radically better experience. At the premium end, Aero's product offering is beautiful. We have very kind of reliable customers, that fly us really regularly. And then, at a global scale, Vista has a semi private offering that's also quite a good offering. but I don't think anyone has really nailed it. Like I think there's really an opportunity here, to do something different, but you'd have to do it, you'd have to pick the right launch markets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Talk about that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so I think, one of the, one of the things is, So we set out with a thesis that we were serving leisure travelers primarily, instead of going after really high density markets. but high density markets are where travelers feel the most pain around the travel experience, right? So the New York, Florida commuters are the ones that have to suffer through the airport and often will choose to fly private instead. So you can pick off that as an opportunity. the other market that I feel is a really compelling place to start something like this is in Europe, where I don't know if any of you have been through Heathrow lately, but last time I was flying to Frankfurt, it was two and a half hour queues, in the mornings. And so the beauty of the European market is because most of the airports are within three hours of, well I'll use the London example, three hours of London a product like the one that we built, with the reconfigured ERJs would be optimal for that market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Uma, when you say, you're not going to have LHR, you're flying out of Gatwick or you're flying and is it the airport and is it potentially the FBO that's changing the dynamics of the experience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so when we were in Europe, we flew out of Farnborough, which was the, private airport. So we ran, scheduled charter, out of Farnborough. And that was a dramatically different experience because you show up to fly internationally 20 to 45 minutes before the flight, and it's a dramatically better experience. and there's no kind of complications of Interestingly enough, in Europe, they have airport security because you're going on an international flight. So you still have to clear security, but it's a very sort of seamless, painless kind of process. It's the magic of flying private for the price of first class.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And are you using the, I don't know Farnborough, very well, are you using the traditional airline terminal or are you using an FBO for that security process, that onboarding process for the passenger?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You use the FBO, which has security in it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thinking about the U. S. market again, there are two ways to characterize the gap in the market, between existing commercial air service and flying private. one of them is, as you've pointed out, there is a less painful, somewhat more premium. service offering that sits between the quality level of the commercial airline experience and flying private. the other one that I'd love to get your thoughts on is the regional airline, air service opportunity, which, 50 years ago in this country, that was a viable business model and, it fell away. It was no longer economic, but commercial air transport today, serves a relatively small fraction of the airports in the country. And when you look at that opportunity, that may not be a, a premium type of service, but is there a window, the way the industry is structured and the way the requirements are structured, for offering that type of service again, in your opinion?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's probably worth delving into why that model went away. so if we think back kind of 20 years ago, right, we had. Continental and U. S. Air, and Northwest Airlines and, before that, Eastern and, Piedmont and all sorts of other kind of air carriers, that were operating in a tightly regulated market, right? And then the airlines went towards deregulation and the sort of hub and spoke model evolved. But what is really complex, and this is controversial, is that the airlines are really beholden to labor. and labor costs keep going up, right? And big structural changes like, ALPA forcing first officers to have a minimum of 1, 500 hours drives labor costs for the airlines way, way up. And if you look at kind of recent transactions in the aviation space, right? Like typically airlines trade a two to three X revenue. But there's an example of a transaction going through now, the Alaska Airlines buying out Hawaiian, where Hawaiian's revenue last year was 3. 2 billion, and they're selling for less than one times revenue, inclusive of debt, right? And that's bananas. That basically says that airlines are inherently, like, value destroying, right? Because you don't even trade at 1x revenue, it's just crazy. And if you look at what their cost drivers are, their fixed costs are extremely high. They, they've got, Part 121 drives you to carry a lot of, surplus, like, very redundant, Kind of very high employee levels, really high fixed costs, and then your variable costs are extremely high, because, on a per hour basis, you're having to spread your pilot costs, and it's just, it's prohibitively expensive to run an airline at scale, right? And so, what we saw in the U. S. happen was, lots and lots of consolidation. And so you've ended up with six transcontinental carriers that operate on razor thin margins. And it's a fundamental kind of structural question, right? and this is, I would argue that the root cause of all of this is, entirely labor. We are beholden to the demands, of labor. And if you look at, at the big carriers are having to pay 600 grand a year for a long haul captain. That kind of cost structure just makes it prohibitively expensive across the airline to operate really efficiently. So you asked the question about can regional travel come back. It depends, right? So right now for the FAA, it has not been a priority to serve these lower cost markets, right? In principle, Part 380 and Part 135 were very deliberately designed to continue to allow access to these markets. So Part 135 carriers are allowed to have, first officers with 500 flight hours, right? That brings the whole cost of the system down. And so you can actually have Regional Carriers, and there's a lot of misinformation circulating about the safety of these things where they're, they've lumped in all Part 135 carriers, not just those carriers operating under Part 380. And if you look at the safety records of the Part 135 carriers operating under Part 380, what you'll find is that they are oftentimes better than the Part 121 carriers. Like, there's been a series in the last few weeks of very high profile incidents with big Part 121 carriers that you don't see with Part 135 carriers. It's, it's noteworthy, in that ALPA and, the big airlines that are going after Part 380 are using safety as a use case when it's a bit, it's a pot calling the kettle black.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Why is it over these years that labor has gained such leverage over the airlines? I mean, clearly you point out that they have and, I, I think we can see that, beyond just that immediate leverage over the airline itself, they're able to use that to, exert influence over the structure of the industry and over the constraints by which, other models like Part 135 with Part 380 are able to operate. But why did that happen in the first place?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a great question. I think some of this is driven by, like, the FAA, as has come out lately, right, is quite significantly understaffed. and so they are not able to, really ask the more nuanced questions about, like, what happens if I strip these things back. But how did labor, how did\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>strip what things back, Uma?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Like, strip, like, look more closely at whether Part 135 operating under Part 380 versus Part 121 if there's truly a difference in the, or, assess the safety cases as made by the controversial carriers. So, how did labor get, get stronger is a great question. Actually, Pete, I don't know that I can answer that. I don't think I have a good answer for that. I think that's just, like, really effective lobbying.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, It's interesting\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>to then extrapolate from that statement to how autonomy gets adopted on commercial aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think the MCAS incidents at Boeing have really set autonomy back, because that was really a push about, that was about a control system that's supposed to do something to override the capabilities of the airplane. But the autonomy, is a great solve for this problem, right? Pilots are getting older. There is a dearth of pilots in the pipeline, which is how they're able to extract, materially higher labor costs. There's far fewer pilots coming out of the military, which used to be a source of, of pilots for the US air carriers. And, I think autonomy will definitely move us forward in that space. So I think you're starting to see, a clear definition of the path, right? So it will never go to full autonomy right off the gate. You'll probably go for, potentially single pilot with a remote kind of override, and then eventually over time might move in that direction. But, But autonomy is definitely kind of part of the long term equation here. But in the short term, I think, we're really stuck, right? We're stuck with sort of six, behemoths, in the U. S. anyway, right? Six behemoths, that are offering transcon service., And then lots of people have started small airlines. So, so the best one, is Andrew Levy's Avelo right now. And he posted recently that they turned a profit. That's a brand new, low cost carrier that's going after these secondary markets. and, the, the thesis there, so he was at Allegiant before that. and the thesis there is like, run, run your airplanes full, offering low cost service to tier two and tier three cities, which is also what Breeze is doing. and then the premium customer, like both of these offerings, no one is solving for the premium customer, right? This is what we were trying to solve for, which is offer a better product at a more premium price to serve, the premium customer in a better way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, Avelo was right down the road from us in New Haven. Boy, those things are packed. I mean, it's a nice service they're providing that's relatively affordable to great cities. So, I can understand why they're being successful. Hey, can I ask a quick question? So, let's line up your airline operation next to the 121 and talk about the main cost differences. Why are you able to be a more profitable operation from the cost side and from a revenue side? Your pilot costs are different because you don't have the same requirements. Also talk about the airside and the landside costs. Because I would assume being out of an FBO, you're providing, well, you're definitely providing a better experience. What's the cost difference?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the theory here, Jim, is that, operating, under part 135 allows you to go into smaller airports, right. You can go into airports that are not part 139 airports that are often less expensive to serve. and so you're going in as a charter operator, right, into these airports. and those airports are materially cheaper to operate to and from. so that's one big cost driver. you have, pilots that are on Certified flight instructors, who are working their way, up the ladder, accruing hours and so there's a delta on pilot costs. You're nominally operating out of FBOs, which are expensive, so that's probably a wash relative to operating out of airports. But the two main drivers are, you've got efficiencies on the airports that you go in and out of, so like the airport landing fees are lower, and you're really driving, in the JSX example, for instance, you're really, working with high caliber, pilots that are not yet, part 121 certified.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>27:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And you're able to charge a premium for what reasons?

But more importantly, it was really about service. So, I don't know if any of you have tried to get an airline on the phone lately. it's like nearly impossible to actually talk to a live human. Whereas at Aero, we answered every phone call. And that, in and of itself, right, that's not to do with the flight experience.

It's quieter in the terminal, it's quieter when you're flying, you aren't just overwhelmed with all of the boilerplate announcements that they're making. You don't have the same sort of treatment in terms of, getting through security. those little things I think add up to a really different experience on the part of the passenger and a different sort of emotional approach to, even undertaking air travel in that case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's no longer a chore. So what we found is like people love flying with us. So we flew a lot of really high profile folks that, for whatever reason can't fly, commercial.

From a structural standpoint, do you see that, looking at the way the regulations are structured under, with Part 121 versus Part 135 operating, in Part 380, do you see a big window for businesses to come into this segment of the market? Or is it really a constrained sort of tiny little knothole that they have to get through in order to make this work. What's your sense from the experience you've had?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's a great question, Pete. I think, Part 135 and the Part 135, Part 380 structure is under attack, and I would argue very unfairly. Part 135, Part 380 was deliberately designed by the FAA and DOT together to allow for, a a semi-scheduled service under 30 people. That was deliberately done that way. if you look at, all the safety inputs there, they are as safe as, if not better than, Part 121 air carriers. And the whole system is under attack now, because lo and behold, the Part 121 regulation was designed to favor the incumbent And to really keep out innovation in this space. And so the next 18 months are going to be super critical for the future of U. S. Aviation. We're in trouble on the OEM side because the structure of the industry allowed for basically only one OEM at scale, right? Because, if you look back 50 years, right, on the aircraft manufacturing side, we had Lockheed and Grumman and McDonnell and Douglas and Boeing, everyone was building passenger aircraft. But as the safety requirements ramped up and as the certification got more and more onerous, as the cost went through the roof to actually bring a product to market, very few companies could sustain that cost. And so, so they were allowed to kind of all merge together and you ended up in the problems that you've got now with Boeing. It is becoming like that in the commercial aviation space. Like, there are these six carriers, and then you've got Avalo and Breeze that have just started, that are competing. And there is not a will, both politically and in the industry, to allow innovation in this space. And so I think the next 18 months are going to determine whether this is it for commercial air travel in the U.S or whether we're going to still have space, for novel ideas and for people to come and serve this premium traffic in a different way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's say that you have the opportunity that even though there's an onslaught right now, let's say that it's a positive outcome. What's the size of the market? Is it a sliver of what the commercial aviation market is today? What percentage is this market the commercial market today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>32:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good question. So when we went through the exercise of sizing the market, we said that commercial air travel was in 2019, a 900 billion market, right? So that included all the airlines globally, plus the charter operators that were, that were, that published results. And that did not include like people that own their own aircraft. So if you assume it's 900 billion, right? And you assume that a third of that is leisure travel, right? So we were specifically targeting premium leisure travelers. one third of that is leisure travelers. And of that. One another third are premium leisure travelers. You ended up with a market size of about a hundred billion dollars globally. So it's not a tiny market. it's a large enough market. So it is fair to say that 30 percent of all air travelers are premium air travelers. So if you look at the kind of total market globally, you're talking about 900. If you remove the sort of leisure filter, you're talking about a 300 billion market. It's a big market. These are people that pay for business class fares.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Uma If the premium travel segment is where the opportunity exists today, do you think that the maturation of technologies enabling electric aircraft is a lever strong enough to create the opportunity for all of the other non-premium travel segments as well?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, so I think, we should look at the evolution of electric aviation. So, so best in class batteries today are about 240 watt hours a kilogram, right? So with batteries that are not super power dense, all of the aircraft configurations that we're looking at today are for small, kind of four, four pax max airplanes. And we need, so at Airbus, we looked at a lot of different scenarios and universally concluded that to have aviation, regional scale aviation, which is the point at which this starts to make sense, you need 800 to 1000 watt hours a kilogram on power density, right? So you have to have radically better batteries. That's the point at which electric aviation becomes material, where you can have regional scale electric aviation. And, so I don't know, like, there's a lot of people working on very small, very lightweight, electric airplanes. And that's fine for sort of the city commute or the suburban commute. But to have regional aviation at scale, we're a long way off. So then you ask the question, what happens, if you have, airplanes that have regional scale range, you still end up in this problem around the operator, right, because, the operating rules determine where you'll be able to operate those aircraft, right? So if the resolution around Part 135 is favorable and it says, hey, you can continue to operate up to 30 seats. Then all of a sudden, it's a really interesting game, right? So, so there is a, a technology maturation. So in 10 years, right, when batteries get materially better and you can have an aircraft that gives you regional scale range, if Part 135, Part 380 are still alive, then you have a framework for potentially new electric aviation air carriers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. And Uma, we're circling around this part 135, 121, 380 discussion. Do you mind taking us a layer deeper into, what's currently the hot topic discussion and maybe a little bit more, on the privileges for each of those.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so it's probably worth backing up a second. So, so Part 121 is the FAA denomination for the operating license, right? So Part 121 carriers are airlines that have to operate out of Part 139 airports that, have to go through TSA and are what we think of as an airline. Part 135 are air charter operators, that operate with DOT Part 380 economic authority that allows them to run on a semi schedule, right? So you can basically run flights, and the goal here is to serve city payers multiple times a day. So you get a Part 135 air carrier, that's your authority to operate. And then you get DOT Part 380, which is your economic authority. And then you get what's called commuter authority on top of that from the DOT, which allows you to operate multiple, like more than four and a half times a week between any city pair. So that's what we're talking about. So this structure was designed very deliberately about 25 years ago during this period of consolidation that Peter talked about earlier. And the goal there was to create a mechanism that would allow service continuity to smaller regional airports, right? And with the goal being that these places don't lose service as you, as the airline industry consolidates. So, so recognizing that those airports have different economics than the kind of major cities. So, so that's the macro structure. And so what's currently under threat is that the Part 380 structure and Part 135 carriers operating on a semi schedule, has proven really popular with consumers. People are choosing to fly, JSX is the biggest one, but services like JSX and Contour and Aero, and are flying under Part 380, on a sort of semi schedule, and people love the service, because they get to fly out of private terminals, and it's a much more sort of seamless experience. And right now, that structure is, is under threat because these services have proved wildly successful. And, and my personal view is that this is, again, the airlines monopolizing to ward off competition. and using the guise of safety to do that. So they're basically claiming that these services are less safe because, first officers only have 500 hours, which as we know is just nonsense. and if you actually look at the data being presented, the data is being skewed in a way that is not accurate. So they are lumping all operators together. And there is a very different, it is a, there's a very, there's a dramatic difference between operators whose livelihoods depend on really delivering a safe and reliable operation with some volume and other operators that, operate one aircraft on a, on an inconsistent basis. And so if you look at, if you look at, at what's happening now, so there's really an interest in trying to get, both the FAA and the DOT to reverse their position vis a vis Part 380 and Part 135 right now. And there's a lot of pressure on the industry to do so. but So, it's not fully clear how this is going to shake out because on one side you have JSX and other operators like, like Contour, and supporting them, you've got United and JetBlue, and then on the other side, opposing them and when viewed with an anti competitive lens, you've got Alpa and American Airlines and Southwest. So this is really going to be a philosophical issue that the FAA is going to need to resolve about whether it wants to allow for, for competition in this space and for new novel experiences that radically benefit the customer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you addressed their safety argument, as they attack this, I've also read that they're using security as another, vector for attacking the model. What is your response to that? What do you, where do you think the ground truth is really with that question?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>39:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, security is an interesting one. So, there was an article that I read at some point about the Homeland Security basically, like, white hacked itself through TSA and found that only 45 percent of the things that they were, that they brought through were actually stopped and picked up. So you could argue about the efficacy of TSA more broadly, right? So the carriers in general, do explosive swabbing on luggage, but the beauty of the Part 135 structure, right, is that the cockpit door is locked and because these, at least those services that are currently in existence, don't have overhead bins, you don't, you're not able to carry a lot of, of hand luggage on board. And so when viewed from the security lens, look, I think, I think everyone recognizes that we'll probably see metal detectors at these, at these, FBOs kind of pretty soon. I think that's an, that's a fairly easy solve. But then, the data would lead you to the conclusion that they are effectively the same.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Uma, if you're successful and you get the outcome that you want and this is a 100 to 300 billion opportunity, I'm assuming these are some of the most profitable passengers on the 121 side that would go to this new model you've created.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>that's the hope, and the expectation.

Essentially, nobody builds airplanes that are fewer than 60 seats anymore. And this is because we've had massive consolidation in the number of airlines, and airlines want bigger aircraft that they run fewer times between the same O and D pairs, right? So they're solving for bigger airplanes. So, Embraer stopped making the ERJ in like 2012, and then Bombardier has basically stopped making the CRJ. And so there are no aircraft that are under really 50 seats anymore that are coming to market except for these electric airplanes. So Heart Aerospace has an aircraft that they're purporting will be, 30 seats, and people are looking at smaller electric airplanes. But one big kind of question for us is, like, where will we get capacity for smaller aircraft, right? So, this is where taking kind of old private jets and converting them. so you basically, you take out the existing seat configuration. Maybe you take out the D VAN and put in more seats, is the most likely path.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Uma, how does an airline differentiate other than routes, the customer experience? How can an airline that is perhaps starting truly defensively differentiate itself?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I think one of the reasons we started Aero was because there is no differentiation, right? You buy, like, other than being loyal. So I was a very loyal one world, traveler when I worked for Airbus, because I accrued so many miles that it didn't make sense to fly anything other than one world. Mileage programs are the single biggest source of competitive advantage for any of the carriers. Once you're, once you have a customer and they're very loyal with you, that's the way. But our thesis with Aero, we didn't have a loyalty program. We sold a lot of tickets because we offered a radically better product. And our customers repeated a lot, right? So people, even without a loyalty program, our average passenger has flown Aero three or four times. And that's, and like, and we had served very few routes, right, between Aspen and Cabo, so depending on how often you need to go to Aspen and Cabo. But you can imagine as we build out those routes that passengers love the product, and they love the service, and they would rather fly a better product than, than fly with a carrier that they may have miles with.

So, there is a huge opportunity on getting parts where they need to be when they need to be there. and There's an enormous opportunity around 3D printing that I think is interesting. So, there's PMA parts that are, parts that are form, fit, and function equivalent to OEM parts that are made by third party vendors. Equally, imagine a 3D printing Opportunity, around creating PMA parts, that I think is really interesting. I think if you are going to be an entrepreneur that starts an air carrier of any kind, you need to start with an inordinate amount of capital up front, right? We're talking about at least a couple hundred million dollars up front because starting an airline is very expensive. You have to build an airline before you start operating. And so you need a lot of capital and a lot of resilience because in aviation when anything breaks or anything goes awry, it's hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix, right? And so, raising capital for an airline, like a tech company, is a very hard thing to do. So, if you decide that you want to be an air carrier, plan to start with a lot of cash up front.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you think about, ideas of creating on demand airlines with nine passengers or less that use, optimization algorithms to match supply and demand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is, this kind of goes back to where we started this conversation, which is about being the operator. Truly on demand services, right? You have to look at the only company that did this well, was ExoJet. And under Brad Stewart's leadership, they built a very robust algorithm that would allow Brad to like predictively assess where demand was going to come from for the 50th airplane 60 days from now, right? But that was based on a really robust dataset. Fundamentally, you have to cover your operating costs, every leg, right? And this is why on demand is really hard. Like, on demand, so, so for the, so, why on demand has never really worked before, right? So, say Peter needs to go from San Francisco to Reno, but the jet is in Long Beach, and the jet lives in Long Beach. So the jet has to fly empty Long Beach to San Francisco. Peter flies San Francisco to Reno, and the jet goes back from Reno to Long Beach. Why on demand? That's two deadhead legs for every revenue leg, and you have to cover the cost of those things, right? So the deadhead leg is functionally the same cost as the revenue leg. Right, so you have to be able to charge three times the price of what it would actually like cost you if that airplane was like already on the ground. This is why the on demand problem is so hard to solve. It's because the costs just don't make sense unless you have sufficient capacity and then you're paying for all these airplanes that are just sitting on the ground.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How is the on demand problem cracked though? Do you have any ideas? Is it a matter of, technology? Is it a matter of, I mean, obviously lower operating costs, but, put that aside. Is it about choosing the routes or the areas that you're serving wisely,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I, frankly, I think on, I just don't believe in on demand. Like, I have not yet seen a model that allows you to crack that because you come back to the fundamental problem with aviation, right? So, The reason that asset-light doesn't work is because, let's back it all the way up, OEMs spend billions of dollars certifying a platform. So, whether it's, Bombardier, or whether it's, Cessna. Anyone that's building a new, PJ platform, they are spending billions of dollars certifying a new platform, right? And then they sell a few hundred airplanes. The OEM has to recover all that cost. So where do they make it up? They make some of it up on the sale of the OE, but most of it up on the aftermarket. So your aftermarket parts are very expensive. Like if you break the windscreen of a Dassault Falcon, it's 250 grand to replace, right? And so the air carrier is carrying a huge maintenance reserve for these things. And fundamentally, right, the problem with on demand is that even if you can get better at predicting where the demand comes from, you have to have a fleet that's big enough to actually satisfy that demand, right? This is like the example of Uber paying its drivers in the early days before it had built up the network to such a scale. And then you get to the problem where how many people can actually afford that super premium leg that has to cost three times the three. This is why, aviation tends to end up on a schedule in order to actually make money. Because having the supply in the right place at the right time is very difficult. So, so, Voom when we first started, for about 15 days, we were on demand. And then extremely quickly, we built a schedule where the helicopters left the helipads every half an hour. Because you can't, like, the economics just are not, you don't have the supply base that you have on the ground to actually enable you to do on demand at scale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It really points towards the, the only format where on demand would work is if you had mass produced, small, inexpensive aircraft and or that were extremely cheap to operate deadhead.

Right. Now, the Uber model benefits from the fact that you get dual use out of all the privately owned automobiles. so they have an advantage there, but what this points towards are the very small, electric or, they're not constrained to that propulsion model, but, of the aircraft that are under development, it's going to be at that end of the spectrum that can be mass produced, where you can drive the cost down, you can amortize the certification cost, that have a glimmer of a hope of realizing this model. but it's a big leap to get there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. And I think from like, what we know, right, is anyone literally anyone can build a flying prototype, but to actually industrialize that prototype is a radically different exercise, right? So to build and get type certificate for an airplane and to certify the design processes, there is zero tolerance anymore for, things to be unsafe. And so the safety standards are only going to get harder to satisfy. And so the delta between a flying prototype and a production vehicle. is huge. So you, So, this is why I think the whole model is very difficult. So even the electric VTOL, right? the only sort of short haul regional airline that's ever made money was New York Airways, which was helicopters every 30 minutes from the top of the Pan Am building to any airport. That's the only one that ever made money and it ran for like 20 years and the reason it made money was because it ran on a schedule. Every 30 minutes from the top of the building you could go to any of these airports. And on-demand is such a difficult problem to solve because the underlying asset is very expensive, the operating cost of that asset is very high, and you have to be able to pool demand in a way that's really difficult.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As you look at advanced air mobility, eVTOLs, drone delivery, military drones, where do you see the best opportunities for the entrepreneur?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>um, I've met an entrepreneur recently who is working on a 1, 000 watt hour per kilogram battery. If they solve that problem, if you solve the power density problem on the battery side, you're going to open up a whole new era of electric aviation, right? And probably become a trillionaire in the process. So I give a lecture on entrepreneurship at my alma mater, in the fall and I, was basically telling everyone to go get a degree in material science because I think if you solve the power, the battery problem for aviation, And then suddenly you've created a new industry, and that's the space that I'm most excited about. So, lightweight, power dense battery technology is the answer to all of these. Because if we had battery, right, so batteries had historically been getting better at whatever, 8 percent a year, right? But now that rate of improvement seems to have slowed, and we may be reaching the capacity So, you need something new and novel, that people haven't figured out what that is yet. So, that's the space that I'm most excited about right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what type of vehicles will be most affected? I mean, are you talking about batteries that will power, larger aircraft? I mean obviously the large planes that, that would be an enormous breakthrough, but people are saying 40 or 50 years from now, what do you think is realistic in the next 10 years on the battery side and what's the impact and what kind of vehicles?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Look, I think until you get to that point, you are talking about small vehicles, right? And so, batteries will continue to improve incrementally, and that only makes the electric VTOL use case better. I don't believe that there's only one use case for AAM. We see a lot of different kind of configurations, winged, not winged, whatever. But basically in the zero to 500 mile range, there are a number of different use cases. There's the urban commute use case. There's a suburban use case. There's the airport to wherever use case, right? And all of those things are interesting and merit different technical solutions. But to really have electric aviation at scale, we need better power density.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>800 or 1000 Watt hours per kilogram battery might be, who knows? It'll be a step change at some point, 10, 15, 30 years I may be, very wrong, but I also may not be far from the truth. What do you think is the comparative advantage of having a battery of such energy density versus having a 50 percent more efficient, conventional aircraft with a combination of improved propulsion systems, and airframe improvements. And so in a world that is very used to operating, traditional aircraft versus embracing a world of flying batteries, that come with baggage that we don't even know yet, what do you think is more appealing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Good question. so the traditional path of making better turbofans and making more efficient airframes, has to be done, right? It's, it, like that, I don't think it's an either or. It's a question about emissions, right? If you really want to get to the COP26 emissions targets, right, where, the airlines are effectively carbon neutral by 2050, then you have to have electric. But if that's not, if that's not really a driving priority, then optimizing existing airframes, making better propulsion technologies is part of the game, right? it's where the game is going. But the biggest revolution in propulsion systems was in the geared turbofan, right? Pratt spent 10 billion dollars bringing the geared turbofan to market, and then once that product was in operation, they had a huge recall, right? So this is like, this is non trivially hard. This is why aviation is so expensive, because it costs so much money to certify stuff and then go back and still have to make improvements over time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think, Luka, on that list of developments, I think that what would be equally, if not even more compelling, would be a small, reliable, affordable micro turbo generator that would be the, the conversion, take a, hydrocarbon fuel, it can be a sustainable one or not, but take all the benefits of that liquid hydrocarbon fuel and convert it to electricity for, small aircraft, small systems and gives you a viable alternative to, some future battery technology. And it would usher in the ability to bring forth long range, really capable small aircraft, whether they're owner operated or whether they are, on scheduled service.

And we wanted to see clearly what's the goal, and then work back how do we get there. And if the goal as I see it, is that we end up more or less integrating UTM and current air traffic control then we need to accomplish a number of steps, which are going to be quite difficult. And so I have the tendency to draw attention to these difficult steps right now, when people say we might do these later, or hopefully maybe do these never because they're difficult. And I, I feel if we take that approach we will have never reached the goal and the benefit that we really would like.

Andrew talks about what major steps must be taken with UAS traffic management and U-Space, and that radical steps have to be taken to integrate the airspace. And if we're going to get the high density operations we need an airspace where all aircraft are going to fly together. And if we don't do it, UAS is unlikely to be economically viable. He extensively discusses U-Space. How it started. Where it stands today, the requirements for setting up U-Space, why it's taken so long to implement and how it'll evolve in the future. Something really revealing about Andrew, in my opinion, is his comment early in our discussion, as he says, we wanted to see from the beginning where we wanted to get to in the end. Where in other parts of the world, UTM is being deployed in a slow iterative process, perhaps the most convenient steps, but not the best steps. Andrew wants to design the system from the beginning and the way he envisions it, looking in the end. And that the expedient and the convenient, we'll never get to where we want to eventually be. That was a really good discussion. Another good section is on drone detection. He refers to the categories of the careless, the clueless and the criminal, and how detection has to account for each. He discusses radar acoustic optical radio-based systems and others, and the challenges of detecting noncooperative aircraft. He mentioned that detect and avoid is not a focus of U-Space today. And how U-Space plans do safely separate vehicles. And to that end, we have a great discussion around tactical and strategic deconfliction. He explains that so much as strategic today because he believes they currently don't have any confidence in this surveillance. And then in order to do tactical maneuvers, you need to know where the aircraft are. Listen how Andrew believes manned and unmanned aircraft will be managed in the same traffic management system. And what will become an automatic traffic management system. Yes I agree with Andrew this is certainly where people tend to get a bit anxious, including some who've been on our podcast. We admire his bold albeit controversial approach to the future of traffic management. He talks a lot about commercial organizations or service providers who are providing or plan to provide traffic management functions. Who they are and where they're based and their commercial and business opportunities. He discusses that these are very tough times to be in the service provider business. Because there's not enough flying yet. He says we suffered from a bootstrap problem in this domain that until there's traffic management there won't be flying and until there's flying, there won't be traffic management. So somebody has to get it started and these companies are all hoping it starts soon. It was an absolute delight to speak with Andrew. He's so informed, he's been doing this for a long time, he's extraordinarily articulate and he has a realistic, balanced, yet optimistic view of how UAS and UTM operations will come together and has some clear areas where UAS operations have real and unique value today. Andrew, thanks for joining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our conversation with Andrew Hatley as you innovate and The Vertical Space.

I am from a research background, and I have been looking at this, UTM, U-Space stuff, and I've been thinking from the beginning, where do we want to go eventually? And I see that there are some radical steps that we need to take. And I have had some disagreements with some people, even some quite notable people on Is it worth taking these steps? Are these steps going to be too costly or too difficult? But I would say that if we are going to get to high density of operations, we're going to get to, electric vehicles carrying passengers, then we need to have, an airspace where all of the aircraft can fly together. And that's going to take a revision of flight rules, which might influence the airspace categorization classes, and I think these steps are a bit scary for some people. Some people look at the current situation and say, how do we get there? So, there are a few people in the industry who disagree with me on taking radical steps, and are these steps justified? But I would say if you look at the alternative, we will just never get to the situation where UAS are economically viable if we don't take these steps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is the disagreement due to the fact that people don't necessarily see the additional value prop or is the disagreement in terms of the complexity, both technical and organizational, to pull something like that off?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the disagreement is mostly about how do we make the step. For example, would it involve retraining people or would it involve modifying aircraft and things like that? And there's always this resistance because the initial impact will be so large. And so that, that's why people tend to disagree with me, but I would always argue that not doing this, the impact will be even larger. So at a certain point we have to grasp the nettle and take a difficult decision. So. I know I recently had a disagreement with Maria from EASA about whether or not we could have a UTM system, a U space system, ultimately controlling manned aircraft. And she felt that was perhaps going to be such a difficult step that there wouldn't be support for it in the industry and so on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Maybe it's important to highlight the difference in the definitions between the U. S. and, Europe. Because I'm guessing in the context that you're referring to, UTM is, increasing automation in managing air traffic, as opposed to traffic management of unmanned aerial systems. Is that correct?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So when we started, the term UTM was being used as a general term. Now, the specific implementation in America has quite a defined scope and is a lot less general than the way that we were using the term in the research community. The European version, USPACE, we started to look at that from a research point of view as being ultimately something that would go on to control these eVTOLs and similar things like that. UTM as it has been implemented in the USA is very much about supporting current operations, supporting VLOS flights, and allowing VLOS flights to occur in an airspace where there are possibly VFR flights going on and things like that. I will tend to use the term UTM more in the general sense, meaning any traffic management of unmanned aerial systems. And typically we are looking at this being completely unmanned traffic management or, as unmanned as we can make it, there will always be a need for escalation to a human for obscure corner cases. We've seen this in many forms of automation, but the general operation we expect will be automatic and it will be providing a service. Because it's automatic, it'll be providing a service which is scalable to a very large amount of traffic, and it'll be providing that service very cheaply. So the scope of USPACE is much broader than the current term UTM is used in the U. S., which is really focusing on the current operations of VLOS flights in the most part. I would imagine as, this part 108, is published for consultation in the summer. it may be that the term UTM begins to take on a broader meaning in the USA. Because I think part 108 will push the envelope a bit and push it towards some of the decisions which have already been made in Europe. do you want me to contrast the USPACE and UTM? Would that be helpful?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Great.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So in, in Europe, USPACE is something which is proposed by the regulator and the USPACE service provider has certain obligations towards the regulator. In the USA, the UTM system, all of the responsibility rests with the aircraft operator and the UTM service provider is a subcontractor of the aircraft operator, but all of the liability still rests with the aircraft operator at all times. So the aircraft operator is seeking support, but that's all he gets from the UTM service provider. Whereas in USPACE, the USPACE service provider is something a little bit like an air navigation service provider in that they have their own responsibilities and they are meeting these towards the regulator rather than only towards the aircraft operator.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, if you could, I think there's subtleties to how people disagree with you. Explain a little bit more about, why you are not at the same sheet. So for example, so many people may say there's going to be an iterative approach to UTM or to U space where you may be feeling, I want to go further faster. Others may be also saying, and I'm now I'm cheating a little bit because we talked a little bit about this in advance, you see the ATC piece being integrated much faster into UTM than others would say, and that's clearly getting into a controversial area. So could you dispel it a little bit more?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it comes from, how we started. the group I was working in started looking at, UTM and USPACE. We wanted to see from the beginning where we wanted to get to at the end. Although it will be an iterative process, we didn't want it to be a process in which each step was going to be the most convenient step to take right now, without a view of where the path would lead. And we wanted to see clearly what's the goal, and then work back how do we get there. And if the goal as I see it, is that we end up more or less integrating UTM and current air traffic control then we need to accomplish a number of steps, which are going to be quite difficult. And so I have the tendency to draw attention to these difficult steps right now, when people say we might do these later, or hopefully maybe do these never because they're difficult. And I, I feel if we take that approach. We will have never reached the goal and the benefit that we really would like. So I tend to argue against the expedient and the convenient. And I'm pushing towards difficult steps and for some of these, so for some of my colleagues, these steps really are tough. If we want to qualify, an automatic system as being an ANSP, then we need to learn a lot about how we qualify these systems, what the expectations are. Today, if you look at, an Air Navigation Service Provider, we certify these with reference to the responsibilities of people, with reference to the responsibilities of management, and it's much harder to take that and say, well, how could we implement all of this stuff as software? What's the algorithmic basis on which you could provide these services without a human there? And it, I think there's a lot of worries in the minds of people who have to actually practically do this, which Perhaps they're not pressing on me so hard as I'm in the research domain. it's much easier for me to be a visionary because, well, I won't be alone in trying to implement this for one thing,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you're also advocating, listening carefully. There are people who are beating up their phones right now, I think, listening to what you just said. So you're also advocating some form of automated air traffic control here, which would have less human involvement. So I would assume this is another controversial part of what you're saying, but you may not be saying that, so please explain in more detail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that's where we get to, but it doesn't start like that. So it starts with, we want to fly UAS in the lower airspace. And we would like to do this as cheaply as possible. So we would like to provide, traffic management services mostly on the basis of software. Probably with a human supervisor for these unusual corner cases for escalation in case of an emergency. But for the general running, Software based. Once we have a software based traffic management system, we have the question about what do we do when a manned aircraft wanders in there for whatever reason. If it's a manned aircraft which is expected, for example some helicopter emergency medical service flight, or a manned aircraft which is unexpected, some light aircraft which has had an engine failure, how do we deal with that? And the current approach which What is proposed is to deal with this as an exception, and we will have the UAS move out of the way and the manned aircraft will be treated as an emergency case. But in the longer term, if we're going to do this in a scalable manner, that manned aircraft has to be treated as a routine process. So eventually, we would like the manned aircraft to participate in the traffic management system, which is providing a service for the UAS. So the, I would like that the manned aircraft is filing a plan, and then is being given an authorization, and then is being monitored that it's following its plan. And once we start to do that, we see that we have a system which can be scaled upwards. These, electrically powered, taxi flights, these eVTOLs, passenger carrying operations, which many operators would like to do without a pilot on board, will probably be managed by a similar, UAS traffic management system. In Europe, we expect USPACE to manage these, but they'll be flying a bit higher than the bottom level, 500 feet. They'll be flying up to a few thousand feet. So now we have a situation where this is an airspace where manned aircraft might fly more than just in case of emergency. And again, I would propose that the logical way to do this in a scalable manner would be to integrate the manned and the unmanned aircraft so that they're controlled by the same system, and so that they are able to interact in a safe but integrated way, and that requires that we have an automatic system which is now giving instructions to manned aircraft, not as an exception, and then we need a qualified automatic system, which is capable of safety of life operations and is good enough to do this. I think that's where people begin to get a bit anxious and begin to disagree with me. I want to go too fast. I'm not sure if I do want to go too fast, but I have a clear view of where I want to get to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Andrew, if this is what success looks like ultimately with UTM, can you go in a bit more detail to describe the milestones that will lead to this success? Both on the, technical side, implementation, cultural, organizational. what are all the stakeholders who have a say in this progression?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, so there's quite a few people involved there. So, The first is that we need to be confident that we can do it. So we need the industry, which is producing the systems, to be able to demonstrate that these systems are good enough and have a high enough quality and a high enough, availability and resilience that they are capable of being trusted to do this. The second step is we need to understand how it will be done. And one of the key problems here, which I would like to spend more time working on, is the flight rule. We do not today fly small UAS following either visual flight rules or instrument flight rules. And if you look at the way that ICAO describes airspace classes, they're all described in terms of these two flight rules. So what we need to do is identify a flight rule for the small UAS, and then understand how it can safely interoperate with the existing ones or the existing manned traffic. One option would be that there's a new flight rule that all of the traffic follows, both manned and unmanned. Another option is that we would find a third flight rule which is compatible with the other two in some way. If you look at the descriptions of how, flights are supposed to occur, it is possible to mix visual flight rules and instrument flight rules today. If we had a third flight rule, perhaps we could find a way to mix that. So, we need to understand the operational basis on which the traffic is mixed together. We need to understand the technical basis on which it's done. What are the procedures? Are the systems capable of providing them? We need to convince the regulator that this is going to be safe enough. It should meet the target level of safety. and we need to convince the existing aviation community this approach is going to be acceptable to them. That they are going to certainly not be inconvenienced and hopefully will benefit from this approach. And we're a little bit optimistic on this basis because, studies have shown that current visual flight rules are not really as safe as people believe they might be, and particularly, tests about visual acquisition of the target show that it's quite common that a pilot of a VFR flight doesn't see everything that they, should. So we are hoping that by providing some support, which is being originated to allow, remotely operated aircraft to fly, that we can enhance the experience of pilot onboard aircraft and that way we can get acceptance for these kinds of what would otherwise be really fairly radical changes to the way that the airspace is structured.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the primary benefit of increasing automation in the air traffic management function? Is there mostly a safety argument? Would you say that this is the primary problem that the industry is facing, or is it more about productivity, being able to accommodate greater traffic density, because part of it, and I'd love your thoughts on it as well, the way traffic management is done in Europe is not the same, obviously, as it's done in the U S organizationally, but at the same time, it feels like there is more inefficiencies and please correct me if I'm wrong in Europe because of the fragmented market, and every nation wanting to have that function internally, as opposed to perhaps sharing it among multiple countries. A couple of questions in there, and I know there's a lot to unpack there, but, what comes to mind?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So there, there are several points there, which I'll need to unpack. Yes. The European air traffic management system is quite fragmented and complicated because air traffic management is the, responsibility of sovereign nations. And in the European Union, we have 27. In, in Eurocontrol, we have 41 member states. So each of these is able to operate its airspace as it wishes, but we work together, and you probably know that Europe has a single integrated traffic management system operated by Eurocontrol, the network manager, and we in the network manager, we ensure that each air traffic control center, well, ensure, we aim that each air traffic control center does not suffer from more traffic than it's able to manage. So there is a process, a rolling process every day where the air traffic control centers look at what kinds of effects might influence their ability to manage traffic, weather effects. I mean, weather is a dominant phenomenon in American air traffic management. it's more prevalent here only in the height of summer and winter. But still weather takes a role. You also have, more subtle effects like important football matches or other things like that which cause, increases in the flow of traffic. All of this is discussed every day in a rolling program and then in the network management system we implement delayed takeoff to avoid that there is, too much traffic in the air, more traffic than can be safely managed. So this goes back to the start of the question where you said, is this a, an issue of safety or is it an issue of capacity? Safety is never compromised, but the result is that when we hit a hard capacity limit, the demand cannot be accommodated at the time it would like to be. So, in Europe, we have these take off slots, which are issued for traffic management reasons, and that is quite evident. In the summer months in Europe, quite a number of sectors of the European sky are at the limit. The traffic cannot be increased without quite some evolution in how we manage the traffic. Certainly among the most busy airspaces in Europe is the region above Belgium, which is a crossing point for traffic coming off the Atlantic Ocean, heading to various European airports, and also traffic flying from Scandinavia towards Spain, and so it's a bit of a crossroads there. And in, in the Belgian sectors, the, Maastricht Air, Upper Air Traffic Control Center really is often pushing towards what it can deal with. And the result, unfortunately, is that the aircraft takeoffs have to be delayed. So, continuously in, in European ATM research, we're looking at how can we improve the capacity without compromising the safety. Many of these kinds of questions can be addressed by some of the techniques that we're looking at to use for UAS traffic management. One of the kind of the most basic principles is we've divided the air traffic management world into sectors. Each sector has normally a pair of air traffic controllers, one of them is talking on the radio to the aircraft, he's the executive, the other air traffic controller is coordinating with other sectors, and the limit to how much work they can do is the mental capacity of these two Air Traffic Controllers to think about the number of aircraft in their sector. For a sector where the traffic mostly fly in straight lines, that capacity can be very high. For a sector where the traffic have to be steered towards an airport or something like that, the capacity is much lower. But it's a mental limit. If the system is completely automated, a computer has no mental limit. We can just buy a faster and faster processor or scale it among multiple computers. So the limits become other than mental capacity. And that way we can, develop techniques in UAS traffic management, which will be re applicable in manned traffic management and promise to increase capacity and possibly reduce costs also. And those aims I think will be in the interest of all airspace users, all air traffic is looking for these kinds of benefits. So there's a great deal of interest from the air traffic management world in what we're doing in the UAS traffic management. But also, as a primary job, we would like to enable UAS traffic. The European Commission and the European, Parliament have identified that operation of small UAS will provide economic stimulus. There will be jobs resulting from these kinds of activities. So they're keen for this to happen as an end in itself. But the benefit that we can accrue from that, we can also apply to air traffic in general.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>27:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Andrew, in that vision that you lay out for the transition to automated handling of, that air traffic, is there agreement on the roadmap for how that information would be communicated to the aircraft themselves and how we move from where we are today to have a different way of communicating that information that its own pipeline is much, much higher capacity than voice over VHF that we have today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, we're at the beginning of this. So, we have a vision of this today. We are not even close to implementation. So the roadmap to get there will start by, let's understand the problem and solve it for the small UAS. And that's going to take us several years. it'll be 2050 or later, before we're beginning to apply this stuff to all upper air traffic. So in, In beginning to attempt to answer these questions, yes, we are looking at what's called, Controller Pilot Data Link, CPDLC, which is being used today in Europe for what you might call low priority communication between the air traffic controller and the pilot. So effectively, they're sending text messages to each other. The use of this I anticipate will increase, and in order to increase, it will require that we have low latency communications. When CPDLC started, there was a lot of worry about the latency, the messages might take a long time. But as we get used to using them, then yes, this could be a way forward. This could be a way to allow further automation of the air traffic control system and then conveying the, information to the aircraft in a more speedy and timely manner.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are people also looking at what that workflow looks like for pilots and controllers where you might have mixed usage of voice over VHF and then the rollout of a data based link and how do people who are in flow, who are, working the traffic, how do they bridge across both of those modalities? Are people, at the same time as they're discussing this roadmap, are they looking at that migration as well?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, that migration is ongoing. I've been involved in, simulation to do with researching this at least nearly 20 years ago, and the early use of CPDLC has been, well over 15 years. It is an ongoing activity and it's also used in the US and elsewhere. The crucial step is to trust it to be speedy enough to use for the kind of separation clearances. Today we're using it for the, lower speed stuff, the, uh, change the radio frequency and contact the other sector type instructions. But, for data link to be, the only means of communication, we need to get a bit more confidence about how well it works and how speedily it works.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, let's talk a little bit about Air Risk Mitigation. Let's bring it back to drone air traffic management. How is EASA approaching Air Risk Mitigation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, today the U space regulations describe a thing called a U space airspace. So the state will declare a U-Space airspace, and that's where these services will be provided and where there will be used. So this process of declaring a U-Space airspace, it's a kind of little reserved area which is dedicated towards flying, UAS BVLOS flights, and so the state has to, or the competent authority as it's called, it's often the Civil Aviation Authority or the National Safety Agency, but it's an agency which is interested in air traffic, will have to look at the region where they want to create this thing, and they will have to create what they call a concept of operation, what they expect the UAS to do, how they expect them to fly, the processes they want to follow, the expected performance, what is the, navigation performance they expect from the aircraft, what speeds are expected, what's the latency that they expect. So once they have this concept of operations and they have to make a kind of estimate of the traffic, they will then do this airspace, risk assessment in which they will balance all of these factors and they will come up with a, A description of how this USPACE airspace can be operated safely or meeting the target level of safety which has been put forward for the area. So that is in the bubble of the USPACE airspace. So EASA today is segregating the UAS into these little regions. For a flight outside these regions, EASA has described an open category of flight, which is visual line of sight, which is done, in a manner where basically the UAS has to get out of the way when something is coming. And the other option is certified operations, which at the moment, there's not really much said by EASA. That would be something that would need to be worked out between the aircraft operator and the Civil Aviation Authority, probably with some kind of specific agreement about how it would be done. Maybe with a danger area created or, temporarily segregated area created for the flight to occur. So these are the, three means of operating today. And this is how, air risk is being handled. In the U-Space regulation, you find two other aspects which relate to air risk. There's this idea of dynamic airspace reconfiguration, and in this process, if necessary, U Space airspace will be temporarily closed to allow a manned aircraft to pass. And this is considered to be done when the airspace was previously controlled airspace, and this process would allow it to revert to being controlled airspace. So, air traffic control could decide to close the used space to allow an aircraft to fly through safely. The third method, is this electronic conspicuity where a manned aircraft could enter the U space airspace so long as it was visible to U space. And this is, in my personal opinion, the least well described. I could imagine this working as an exceptional process, but I'm not so happy with it being a regular thing, because effectively the manned aircraft comes along and all of the U-Space traffic has to get out of the way, and in doing so may encounter their own problems. So, this is the current approach to air risk. It has to be said that the current European, regulations anticipate quite low density of traffic, and we would be looking forward to a revision of the regulations, as the density of traffic is rising, and we start to see a need for more subtle, air traffic management for the UAS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can we be a bit more specific and maybe run through a scenario of a drone operator who wants to fly a commercial drone delivery service or any commercial drone beyond visual line of sight in a, suburban slash rural area. And let's put the ground risk aside and just focus on the air risk. The challenge that exists today, and again, correct me if I'm wrong, but if one looks at the SORA air risk matrix, essentially any time that you're flying below 500 feet above ground, unless you are flying in uncontrolled airspace over rural areas, you pretty much immediately fall in, in the Air Risk Charlie class, which automatically classifies the operation as SAIL 4. The problem, though, is there's no tactical, TMPRs the tactical mitigations for the residual air risk that are approved for, medium and high integrity levels. So the challenge for these drone operators becomes; how can we somehow reduce the air risk class by either flying in U space, which is automatically class Bravo, or I shouldn't be using class Bravo because that confuses with traditional airspace, but ARC B, or they go and run an analysis of the actual air traffic, and show that the risk of encountering, manned traffic is actually lower than what the original SORA matrix would suggest, and therefore they get that class reduction. So talk about this challenge that operators today face. What are the levers that they usually pull on? Is this description correct?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Your description is perfect, and I'm very impressed with your knowledge of the domain. Yes, this is exactly what's going on. And if you look at, and I must say it's not something I'm particularly expert on, but if you look at the operations today, which are occurring, you have Manna operating in Ireland. You have Wing operating in Finland, you have soon Amazon operating Italy. They are typically having to deal with the fact that there's not yet uSpace available, but uSpace is coming soon. And as you correctly described, one of the things that they have to do is they have to make an argument about is the air risk acceptable? Is the risk of manned traffic coming by low enough? And typically that can be mitigated by asking for a restriction. and in Finland, you find, occasional restrictions are placed with the word Wing in the title, so you know who's operating there, but, either a restriction or, as you say, an analysis of the traffic, but that analysis, which you're talking about is the first small iteration towards this air risk assessment. Air risk assessment is a more thorough and long term version of this analysis. And so setting up a U-Space airspace is a logical extension of the process that, an exceptional operation would need to go through. So today, these operations are not in U-Space airspace, but the hope is that very soon they will be, we're expecting 2024 to see the first U-Space airspace is declared and it clearly makes sense to put them where people are currently wanting to fly. So, I would hope to see their emergence, in and around some of these areas where these operations are occurring.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:28\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the requirements for setting up U-Space? Is there a threshold in terms of the traffic density that an area needs to have in order to warrant U-Space implementation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, there's nothing like that. It's a a choice to be made by the competent authority in each state. So we may see, U-Space airspaces which are set up in result of a demand from an Aircraft operator. We may see them being set up as a result of a demand from a service provider. We have seen a lot of interest in flying in harbors, for example, and there the harbor operator might be the one who would be, pushing for, a U-Space airspace to, to be declared. Or we might see states who want to set up U-Space airspaces because they have an expectation that once one exists that flying will begin. It's hard to predict at the moment because we're in a special period at the moment. Everybody is feeling their way and learning how to do this. I think once we have one or two U-Space airspaces declared, I think we will, then gain more experience about how to create them, more experience about how they can be used, and we'll see a period of fine tuning, but also a period when more and more are created as the states master the process and are more confident about declaring these things. And it must be said that there is quite a lot of work to do in the airspace risk assessment, because at a certain point there needs to be a link made between, for example, separation and the performance of the various systems, the performance of the aircraft, the performance of the traffic management system, the performance of the surveillance as it is. So, this is why the states are going quite slowly at the moment, but I think once it's been done a few times, I think the states will gain confidence, and it will become something which is done more readily. And then I would see in Europe that it would be, not unreasonable that a request from an aircraft operator, certainly if it's going to be more than just a few flights, might result in the work being done to, to set up a U-Space airspace.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Talk more, Andrew, about why it's taken so long to implement U-Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's really been a learning process. The U-Space regulation was published, in 2021, and then it took us quite a long time to develop the acceptable means of compliance.

There's still quite a lot to learn about, what standards to apply, how to make the implementation, how to certify the service providers. What the, Airspace Risk Assessment comes out at. What is the minimum required performance for the aircraft in order to achieve a separation which is fine enough to make the U-Space airspace have a capacity that makes it worth operating? We can achieve safety by restricting the flights a great deal, but that's not the aim of U-Space U-Space should allow BVLOS flight to be approved relatively quickly and often that the expectation is that the aircraft operator will put in a plan and generally that plan will be approved. We are hoping to avoid that, that planning results in rejection and conflict detection as a, a frequent occurrence. It should be a rare occurrence. We're hoping to promote the use of the UAS by, creating these U-Space airspaces. So the, airspace risk assessment should hopefully, produce a separation requirement which allows a reasonable capacity. And the state, or the competent authority which is making the airspace risk assessment needs to be convinced that the performance of the aircraft, the navigation performance, its ability to fly, the surveillance system, the satellite navigation and so on. All produce a situation where this separation can be achieved and produce a convincing story that it can be achieved repeatedly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, where and when do you see U-Space being deployed in Europe in what countries and why?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have a reasonable expectation that we'll see something in 2024, probably Spain, Switzerland, and I'm hoping in Antwerp, there's a project called BIRDI, a European funded research project, which is trying to create, U-Space airspace over Antwerp harbour and I think they have a good chance. They, have a lot of resources and they're working hard towards this. But at the same time, there's a kind of unofficial race going on. I think Zurich are doing well and, I think we'll see one in Spain certainly in 2024, if at all possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Drone Detection, how are they handling it in the U-Space? What are the different ways they're addressing it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So drone detection has not been considered part of U-Space so far. And this is perhaps, it's worth noting that, security matters are the domain of the state. And, EASA, European Aviation Safety Authority, tends not to, get too much involved in saying things about what states should do. So, the U-Space regulation doesn't talk about drone detection, but we have a lot of interest in drone detection in Europe, and we're seeing quite a lot of activity, often driven by, state security organizations, often relating to airports, but other areas as well. And, the drone detection really is aiming at three different groups, referred to as the careless, the clueless and the criminal. And for the careless and the clueless, we can do quite a lot because we may require fit of equipment to the aircraft, which makes them detectable. The criminal are the third group and we're in an arms race with them. It's always going to be, what can we do and what can they avoid us doing? So, I think progress is being made in this field. Initially there was a lot of interest in primary radar, but that's very difficult. The aircraft presents a very small target for radar. The reflection is quite weak. The, small UAS move around at similar speeds to cars in some cases, or to birds. So it's easy to get, false positives from other things. So it's a difficult radar target, but there are methods that can be used. Other techniques which can be used include listening out for the command and control link radio signals. But again, in the case that somebody really doesn't want their drone to be observed, they can find ways around this. There has been some interesting work about drone detection in terms of one aircraft detecting another based on listening. There was a project called PercEvite, which was working on a hear and avoid, mechanism. And, that looked quite promising. And there's been a number of projects have been looking at see and avoid based on cameras and image recognition, sometimes stereoscopic, sometimes, with a single camera, these have in the kind of prototypes required quite a lot of electricity to be put into the, computing process to do the image recognition. But perhaps with a bit of refinement, these could become practical. It's not something that we're particularly concerned about in U-Space yet, because in U-Space we consider detect and avoid to be a safety net rather than the primary means of separation. So we are not at the moment requiring detect and avoid to be something fitted to aircraft in U-Space. Instead, we will separate the aircraft very widely so we feel that the residual risk is low enough that the detect and avoid is not necessitated. It will probably become something more significant when we go to higher risk operations, either because the density increases or because we start to have passenger carrying or things like that. So, there the risk might push us towards requiring, a safety net in terms of a collision avoidance system on the aircraft. And there, there is a lot of work being done. But at the moment, U-Space is not mandating any particular implementation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the U-Spaces that you expect to come online this year, the DAA function, as you say, will just be, assured in terms of making sure that the airplanes and drones never come close to each other or the drones themselves right. Is there a difference in how you are thinking about separating drones from manned aviation as opposed to drones versus drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the current functioning of U-Space, the drones are separated by means of the planning. So any drone flying in U-Space must have a plan. It's called a flight authorization request. And these flight authorization requests are de conflicted. So the idea is that we de conflict the plans. If the plans are followed, then we've de conflicted the flights. We can't do this with manned aircraft that wander in. So instead we have this requirement that the manned aircraft are electronically conspicuous. The electronic conspicuity is handled by the U-Space service provider, so it becomes part of the traffic information which is shown to the pilot of the drone. Now the traffic information which is shown to the pilot of the drone differentiates between nearby aircraft which are conforming to their plan, which are, the pilot would be aware of but not concerned by. And nearby aircraft which are not conforming to their plan, which are potentially a threat. These manned aircraft, which are electronically conspicuous, will definitely be in the threat category. So, the, requirement in U-Space is that the drone takes appropriate action, which will be to get out of the way. So that means that this, handling of the manned aircraft, it, it should be safe, but it is going to be an exceptional process. It is going to require that the drone deviates from its plan. I await experience to see how this works, how well we can accommodate manned aircraft, I would not be very comfortable if this was a frequent occurrence, but certainly as it's been described, it is intended to be an infrequent occurrence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in those cases where multiple drone operators are flying in the same area, how will drones be de conflicted and separated from each other?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's done by this planning. The drones will all need to plan. The plans will all be de conflicted. Even if they're using different U-Space service providers, the U-Space service providers between themselves will arrange that the plans are all de conflicted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So these service providers are commercial organizations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. So, the, approach which has been, encapsulated in the U-Space regulation is that the provision of services is a competitive commercial activity. So, we expect multiple service providers, or we hope for multiple service providers and that they will compete, they will innovate, they will offer added value to their customers. The U-Space regulation describes six services which they should provide, four of which are always required. The other two may be required depending on what the, Competent Authority says about the U-Space airspace and we expect that these commercial operators will offer their customers a service which fits the customer's need. If the aircraft operator has a need for, high precision, high efficiency, they're probably willing to pay for that, and they will be paying for tools which allow the kind of things they want to do. If the aircraft operator has lower requirements, they may be able to get by with a cheaper offering. So we expect these U-Space service providers to occupy niches, have particular specializations and to innovate in the area. So EASA, and the aim of the European Union was to create hopefully a single European market for U-Space service provision. So we would see the emergence of U-Space service providers who could operate in multiple European countries. We would get economies of scale and we would quite quickly arrive at innovation high performance and, hopefully the lowest possible price.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, this four dimensional flight path de confliction strategic planning issue, there's been some research that showed that you really can't be very confident looking more than, several minutes, into the future because things happen in real life. There's weather, there's contingencies, there's all kinds of things. How well do you think that this approach will, handle the real world?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's a continuous trade off. The, plan that the aircraft operator is asked to submit is not a line, but a series of boxes. And we asked the aircraft operator to plan these boxes, as large as they need to be that the aircraft operator has a confidence of 95 percent that they can follow this plan. So, it's not clearly spelled out, but if an aircraft operator is consistently planning too small, they will deviate very often and they will often end up in a contingency situation and they will have to invoke a contingency plan because they're unable to follow the plan that they've submitted. The other option is that the aircraft operator is very conservative and, submits enormous boxes. They say, like, all of the city for all of the afternoon, and they will simply find that they're in conflict with everybody else. So, there should be a natural pressure that the aircraft operator begins to master their uncertainties, that they begin to understand what weather will bring, and they will plan in function of their ability to fly. We, would anticipate that they would hopefully get better at this. We would hope that they could vary their speed, for example, they wouldn't always fly as fast as possible. So they have a bit of margin to deal with unexpected gusts of winds and so on. So we would hope that, in a mature U-Space, the aircraft operators are able to plan in a manner, which is sufficiently sized so that they can conform to the plan, but sufficiently small that they don't simply conflict with everybody else.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is it likely that their uncertainty will increase the more minutes into the future that they're planning? You know, they might be able to be quite precise four minutes, five minutes, seven minutes into the future in terms of where the aircraft is going to be in the plan, but if it was a very long flight, would that change towards the end of the flight or is that something that people are mitigating?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We, that, that model is generally true, but there has been work in manned aviation with what's called, trajectory based operations, where we can essentially have the idea of a kind of four dimensional contract where the aircraft will speed up and slow down in order to be within the agreed performance. The question is really a trade off. How much is the aircraft operator prepared to sacrifice in terms of flying at the most efficient speed and the straightest line compared with flying in order to be able to get their plan approved. So we would imagine there'll be a bit of give and take there, a bit of trade off, and I would imagine that once a U-Space airspace is running, the aircraft operator would be, well, complaining, would be reporting to the competent authority if the planning constraints were holding back their business. There is likely to be a requirement that the, competent authority would revisit the airspace risk assessment. And one input into that is the expected traffic. And I would expect that the aircraft operators would probably take the opportunity to express their desire for a different compromise on separation should they find it too constraining.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do people discuss things like, you know, afternoon thunderstorms that come up that might throw the entire plan out the window in this type of an architecture?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They do, but certainly, bad weather is probably less of an issue in Europe than in the US.

Yeah, absolutely. Now, the trigger, surprisingly, might not be the density, because, eventually, when we can't master the uncertainties at the strategic phase, we have to try and master the uncertainties at the tactical phase. And then we would be required to do tactical conflict resolution. Once we have tactical conflict resolution, we can allow more residual risk to remain after the strategic. But one of the big drivers of uncertainty are passengers. So I could quite imagine that the introduction of passenger operations, these eVTOLs carrying passengers around, would quite quickly push towards the need for tactical services. The passenger typically is going to have an impact on the take off time predictability. If the person has to get into the vehicle, might be their first flight, might feel a bit unsure, might feel a bit frightened or unwell. I could quite, imagine that relating to a, it takes longer than expected to close the door and then they miss the takeoff time. So I could quite imagine that we would have to go to a process where the aircraft are not de conflicted strategically, but are subject to a demand capacity balancing process and then are being de conflicted tactically. And I would say that's going to be the big push, but once we have Tactical Deconfliction, we can use it to increase the capacity of U-Space airspaces as needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I mean, this entire conversation around strategic planning, just evokes the famous Mike Tyson quote that everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. So, and, so, why especially among aviation professionals that know that things happen in the real world. It never goes according to plan. It's weather, it's, all kinds of different things, right? And so, why is there so little emphasis on tactical means is it because the technology is not there?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So why is it all strategic? Well, because we currently don't have any confidence in the surveillance. In order to do tactical maneuvers, you need to know where the aircraft are. You need to know with a known level of uncertainty where the aircraft are. And we don't today know what that level of uncertainty is. You will notice in the U-Space regulation that conformance monitoring is optional today. That's because conformance monitoring also requires that we have confidence in and have characterized the level of the surveillance that we can locate the aircraft during flight. And we don't today have that level of confidence. So the initial use of U-Space will be almost completely based on this strategic de confliction, and because of that, the margins for all of these uncertainties will have to be very large, so the aircraft will be very far apart. Once we begin to see flights, and we begin to get some experience, we can begin to characterize how well does the surveillance work. And in the U-Space regulation, there's this thing called Network Remote Identification, where the aircraft is sending to the U-Space service provider its position and the time and its identity. We will observe that for quite a while before we begin to rely on that. There may be opportunities to confirm how well that system is working. Interestingly enough, one of the users of U-Space is Israel, and in Israel, for security reasons, they have been doing a lot of monitoring the position of these aircraft by other means, and have been able to determine reasonably well how well this network remote ID is working. And certainly they have now scaled their separation minima in function of their confidence in this network remote ID. In the rest of the U-Space community, we still lack that experience, and I would expect most competent authorities would want to see traffic in their own cities, in their own U-Space airspace, and understand how well the surveillance is working before they begin to rely on it. So this is why we will have essentially have to have a time delay before we can get to any kind of tactical service. The first tactical service would be conformance monitoring. Conformance monitoring would allow, these margins for uncertainty to be reduced. They would allow the separation to be reduced a bit. And then, once we're really confident we would be able to introduce tactical services where we're giving instructions to de conflict the aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the rough timeline for this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I, optimistically, we'll see this stuff experimentally very short term but to have it rolled out generally, it could be another 10 years before everybody is really confident about this and it becomes routine, widespread.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned a little bit, different ways of, detecting. Acoustic, Optical, et cetera. Can you spend a bit more time, and perhaps broaden that list, including Radar and some of the others and comment the pros and cons, of each and what you believe is the most attractive option.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To detect a non cooperative target, the problem with radar is that you illuminate the target with your own radio. So the amount of power that needs to be pushed out in order to get an echo back is enormous. The power falls off in proportion to the fourth power of the distance. So, you can be transmitting thousands of Watts and get microWatts back. So it's a very difficult job to do. And as I said, there are similar targets which will give clutter. There are cars and birds and things like that. Typically, we're seeing radar reserved for situations where the high cost, can be justified despite the low range and the not fantastic performance of these systems, but still it's better than nothing. Much more interesting to use optical where the illumination comes from the sun and you only have to capture the reflection. There is work going on there. I haven't been so involved in using optical, processes to detect drones for example, surveillance, but in terms of, collision avoidance, there's been quite a lot of research done in universities about this. And I think we're potentially seeing, this leading to practical systems in the reasonably short term. Hear and avoid is in the very early days, but it potentially, has quite some benefit. It's very good at detecting light aircraft, for example, or helicopters, which are especially noisy. Then we get onto collaborative means. If the other aircraft would like to be detected, radio based systems are obviously one option. The problem there, though, is finding radio frequencies which are available. Proposals for the electronic conspicuity which are coming from EASA include, one of these industrial scientific and medical radio frequencies, which is all very well, but it may suffer from interference. Another option would be, acoustic or, optical broadcasting, so, some kind of flashing light or ultrasound or something like that. And I think work is going on all of these, but, Yeah, I haven't been involved particularly in any research project which is looking at that. My, my main interest so far has been traffic management rather than on vehicle systems. Our colleagues over, at, Johns Hopkins are looking at a, there is a, some work going on developing a replacement for TCAS. TCAS in the generic term is referred to in the industry as ACAS, and the project which was developing a replacement for that was ACASX. ACASX spawned some variants, one of which was ACAS XU, which was for unmanned. Quite some work has been done on that. And, Josh Silbermann at Johns Hopkins was leading a project called ACAS SXU for small unmanned. And that was pretty promising. I've not been involved in that for a year or more, but it looked like it was going to go somewhere. So that was looking at using a system which would be compatible with manned aircraft. So, I think if that comes to, fruition, it's quite likely that standard would be adopted quite widely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Has there been any research on the potential for detecting the RF energy that's being emitted by the drone's propulsion system, perhaps the speed controllers or other sources of, what most of us would refer to as EMI, but detecting that in a useful way.

Projects which I've been aware of have more focused on the command and control link, which, is easier to detect and also easier to interrupt. There have been some, different approaches with that, because certainly, you can buy this box from DJI, this aeroscope to listen in on their communications. It makes it more obvious about what to jam if you want to jam the thing, and also you can listen on the telemetry. You can find out where the aircraft is, where the aircraft operator is, and things like that from listening into the command and control. So it's very beneficial to do that. The problem is if somebody doesn't want to be seen, they will encrypt that or they will use other methods. If they're already criminal in the way that they operate the aircraft, they can be criminal in the way they use the radio spectrum. So it is a harder task to detect and stop somebody who doesn't want to be detected and stopped.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's talk a little bit more about the service organizations you've talked about, Andrew. What's the barrier to entry for some of these organizations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The barrier to entry is probably, not enormous, but it's certainly there are fewer companies pitching into the service provision area than we saw emerge trying to build aircraft. So maybe it's not such fun. But if you look at the ones who are active today, I would single out the team at Wing as having put a lot of energy into developing standards and trying to create an environment, for U-Space for UTM. But Wing are a bit unusual in that they have no particular desire to be a service provider. They are, they see service provision as being just a necessary step so that they can become an aircraft operator. Amazon have also been active in that area. Again, Amazon, I believe, will only be their own service provider, but they've certainly contributed to the standards which are being evolved, and they've taken, quite some role in, in driving the industry. So those two are combined aircraft operator service providers. In terms of who else is in the service provision? You have a few companies who are pure service providers. I would, mention Dronic in Germany and, D Flight in Italy. and each of those kind of emerged before the U-Space regulation was published. And at that time, there was a slight expectation that they would become the kind of the appointed national service provider. But they are purely service providers. Behind them, there are companies writing software for service providers, and there are more of those, and I would mention. ANRA is one, which is operating in Europe and the USA. Unifly is based in Belgium. They've done well, supplying software to different, operating companies. OneSky, another, American company, which is seen in Europe. Drone Radar in Poland. and some of these, although they are primarily aiming at being software suppliers, some of them are in the process of becoming certified as service providers to prove themselves and also to make up for the fact that other service providers are not stepping forward. I know that ANRA are in the process of being certified at the moment, and we might see them offering services possibly in Switzerland, I don't know, but, they may see that as a necessary step. There are some of the larger ATM companies involved in the business, like Collins, Frequentis, Indra, and Thales, and all of these are looking at parts of the business, Frequentis is probably more looking at the other end. In the European model, there is the U-Space service provider, which, delivers services to the UAS operator. And then there's another body called The Common Information Service Provider. And Frequentis are looking at supplying software to those. The Common Information Service Provider is, a role which the state may appoint one or may decide not to and that role is involved in distributing information to everybody. And so Frequentis are looking at that, Indra are looking at that. So there are different larger companies looking at joining this market. I've met most of these companies through participation in European research projects. So when we've been, looking at, doing research, I've particularly been involved in research projects, looking at really fundamental questions at low maturity. I've worked with many of these companies, in these research projects, trying to answer very basic questions. How should things work? How do we solve these simple questions. What does a flight plan look like? And how do we deal with it? And so on. So, that's where I've met them. I've, I could mention even more. There's, Airbus UTM, who were previously known as Altiscope. They have a simulator. I'm working with them, they have a reference implementation of UTM in their simulator. There's a strong team there, they're very active in the development of standards, they're very active in the, work that's being done at ICAO, looking out how we can, integrate, this UAS stuff into the ICAO annexes and documents. We also have other smaller companies, the Technological Institute of Galicia has developed some UTM system, which has been adopted by Boeing. Boeing have a team in Madrid who are really expert at simulation of aerodynamics. And so Boeing have developed a simulator for, UAS which uses the ITG system to offer a complete package. There's a company called Open Skies operating. It's a very small company, but they've developed an open source, implementation of a kind of uTM system, which although it doesn't, isn't fully functional or it's partly functional, it is very compliant with the available standards. And because of the standards, compliance, their tool, Flight Blender, is widely being used for testing, often in combination with the, automatic testing mechanism of the, inter USS, which is an implementation of the, Discovery and Synchronization Service. Inter USS is also open source and it's a reference implementation of the DSS and includes within it a testing function. People are using that to test their system and they're using FlightBlender as a reference to compare their system against.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The big outstanding question is how do these companies make money, right? What's the willingness to pay?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a question I simply can't answer. These are very tough times to be in this business, because there's not enough flying yet. We suffer a bootstrap problem in this domain that until there's traffic management, there won't be flying. Until there's flying, there won't be traffic management. So somebody has to get it started, and these companies are all hoping it starts soon. Because without flying, there won't be a revenue stream for many of them. I still wonder how many, the market has room for. I have good friends in all these companies. I wish them all very well, but honestly, it's a tough business. I don't envy their position.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew talk about the origin of U-Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So U-Space, we started with, an idea that there would be traffic management and in the research domain, we looked to the end goal from the beginning. And the end goal was that we would be able to control all traffic, including passenger carrying operations. The other thing that happened quite quickly in Europe was, the European Commission identified that UAS was going to be an area of important commercial activity. So, they wanted to promote U-Space. So, top down, Europe got to work on regulations. Regulations are valuable in Europe because we are 27 European Union member states. It would be quite likely that without a top down European regulation, we would have 27 completely different implementations. So the view of the European Union was that they would like to promote a single market. They wanted a harmonized environment where an operator, an aircraft operator or a U-Space service provider operating in one European country could move to a neighboring European country without difficulty. So this is why in Europe there was a rush to produce a U-Space regulation. This U-Space regulation has described how to fly beyond visual line of sight and it's described an airspace in which this is possible called a U-Space airspace. Now in America you have a totally different set of problems and you have a totally different environment. The Federal Aviation Authority is both the regulator and the service provider. And it was quite clear that Congress wasn't excited about the FAA becoming a service provider to drones. So I would say that the momentum in the USA was held back. It wasn't being driven by the FAA. Industry was driving this, wanted to do some stuff. The FAA was following on, making it possible, but observing, and we now see the gestation of this part 108. It will hopefully be available for comment this year. I think I slightly envy the position the FAA are in, in that they will be able to write Part 108, taking into account experience and observation of flying, which is, which has taken place, without their regulation. And so I think, the rest of us will look at the American regulation. I mean, Some people might say, Oh, it's behind, but. It won't be behind. I think we're all moving at the same speed. The American regulation will benefit from having been written, having taken into account the experience that's being gained, for example, at the moment in Fort Worth, with seven different operators flying, seven different service providers supporting them. And so the learnings from that experience can be fed back into regulation. Yes, there are big differences in the current situation, but I think in general, we're pretty similar in what's driving this, that the drones are there and we need to take care of them. They may pose a risk to the other aviation. They may pose a risk to the public. In general, the Aviation Safety Authority is tasked with dealing with that. So drone regulation is a natural outcome. And the second is that in, in both the US and in Europe, there is a political imperative to enable this stuff. So the regulation is not purely restrictive. It is trying to let this stuff occur. So I, I think, we are following slightly different paths, but we're going to the same place quite quickly. And, in my domain, in the research domain, we have a healthy cooperation with both NASA and the FAA. We meet, we compare notes, we discuss. So there is not any fundamental difference in outlook or opinion. But there are some. Some differences in just, like, the way things have ended up. Our regulation came first. Our regulation particularly pushed this idea that service provision would be a competitive market. It could be, that in some states they're not bothered about that. They might want to simply appoint a single service provider, as is often done for, manned aviation. So you know, that's a choice that Europe has made so it's not necessarily the only choice, but it's the one that, in which I'm working. And, it's a similar choice that has been made in the USA. FAA doesn't want to be the service provider, so there'll be a market for service provision.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:18:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What notable differences exist in the way that the FAA and EASA think about strategic and tactical deconfliction? And especially when multiple operators are flying in the same area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:18:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the, this is most visible when you look at what's being done in the USA to support the passenger operations. So the work that's been done in the USA, on the passenger carrying operations started with this question. Is it when, well, it started with the question, what is it? And then they might discover that it was similar to, managing small UAS. In Europe, we started with the question, can we extend the system, which is designed to manage small UAS? can we extend that system to manage passenger operations? So in America, you'll hear these terms like pSU, Provider of Services to, I don't know what the U is, UAM. and we have discovered from the work done at NASA that it's very similar. One of the key differences is in the world of the passenger carrying operations, the PSU will not do strategic conflict resolution. The PSU will make, with a demand capacity balance, they will limit the number of aircraft entering the airspace to the level that the tactical processes can safely deal with, and then the separation will be tactically achieved by, well, by means which are, still under discussion, actually, because, one of the interesting things about this work on, urban air mobility in the U. S. A. is this idea that there will be these community based rules, and these community based rules are still being worked out. We in Europe are being a bit more top down, we are saying it's going to be the similar approach which was, is being used for small UAS. So we're, at the moment, we're talking about strategic followed by tactical. It may be in future that we might drop the strategic. I don't know. It depends. That's the subject at the moment for research. But, the model that we're working on today would be a strategic with a certain residual risk and then tactical to deal with that residual risk.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Andrew, paint a picture of what the next five or so years looks like in relation to U-Space drone operations in Europe and potentially beyond.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think, I would really seriously hope that within five years we see, operations of a commercial nature in Europe. I would expect to see a revision of the acceptable means of compliance of the U-Space Regulation. I would expect to see the American Part 108 has been published and is in use. I hope, but I'm not expecting a revision of the U-Space Regulation itself. Regulations are hard things to change. I would like to see, commercial operations. I would expect that they would probably be focused on niche areas where there's an obvious business case. And one of the most interesting areas that we're seeing in Europe is harbours and port areas. A lot of processes in harbours and port areas require somebody to get into a boat, or if you were going to do an aerial observation, It's very expensive with a helicopter. So there are many things that people want to do that they cannot. And so I would imagine, as we're already seeing in Rotterdam, Antwerp, and in, Hamburg Harbor, we will see a growth of use of, drones and, implementation of, U-Space or U-Space like currently, but hopefully official U-Space in Harbor areas. This is, I believe, commercially viable today. The other area, which, is a pressing area of interest is delivery, but delivery today in Europe is tending towards suburban, so it's not really an urban activity. And I would imagine that, the kind of pilot projects that we see in Ireland, in Finland, in Norway, we're working with a company called Aviant, which is delivering around Trondheim in a rural area. We would see these increase in number and we would see them being enclosed inside U-Space airspaces. And we will see these U-Space airspaces popping up like, like mushrooms on a lawn. We will probably be a, not obvious why they're there, but then you go and look and you find there's, here in this place, there's a niche where commercial operations are viable. I would say that the, my least expectation is that it becomes focused on urban, in each case. I would say that probably suburban or harbor will be my initial one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:23:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew you've been doing this for a while. I'm sure you have some good advice for our innovators and entrepreneurs on the line.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:23:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would really say work out what your niche is, work out what you're really specialized at. If you, hear some of the stories which are being told about, what people want to do, I would say, is it really realistic to try and compete with ground transport? And you may recall, an experimental project that was done by Airbus, pre COVID, a thing called VOOM, where they set up a kind of on demand helicopter flight service in San Paolo. San Paolo has the benefit of having a large number of helipads, has a quite a large population of helicopters, many of which are sitting idle most of the day, and it also has terrible traffic problems. So there was a willingness among the public, or some members of the public, to pay quite a lot for a short flight and that made this VOOM thing viable. I would say if you're going to come into this business, you need to understand what is the specific set of circumstances where your business will work. And if you come in with a general approach, we're going to deliver cups of coffee. I would say, like really, how can that be better than the man on the bicycle or whatever the alternative is today, you really have to understand what is your value added and where is the niche where that value added is appreciated. And yeah, I wouldn't today be looking at trying to replace or compete with the metro or even taxis in many cities. I'm sorry if I disappoint my colleagues in the taxi business, but really you have to be pretty good to do better than public transport in most European cities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:24:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew this has been a great conversation.

The first question we ask ourselves when we're trying to go do something new, whether that's a new location, new airspace, new environment, new weather envelope, new aircraft, all these different things. The first thing we ask ourselves is, what is the level of safety that we need to achieve for these operations and how do we have the confidence that we have achieved that? And early on in the program, we'll say, what do we need to do in order to look back and what does success look like in the testing or analysis that we're going to conduct? Then the next question is, what's the regulatory pathway, what do we need to show compliance with? What are the regulator expectations? And so I think that's something that isn't fully unique to Zipline, but I think is a little bit unique where a number of aviation companies start off with a compliance mindset and Zipline was founded on more first principles than that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Eric Watson from Zipline. Hey, listen, you can't help, but be impressed with the inspiring and important work that Zipline has done with their partners in Africa. With medical and healthcare outcomes that are remarkable. So you'll really enjoy hearing about Zipline and their first platform in Africa. Eric gives an excellent overview. We then transitioned to their work in the United States with our platform two. We discuss how their experiences in Africa helped and contributed to their U.S. performance. We discuss what's similar and what's completely different between the two markets. Listen, Eric is a pro at discussing the U.S. certification process. He takes it from ground up. As if we were starting from scratch, what's required, what has changed throughout the years what's working well and what can be improved and and how the certification process is different than what they first anticipated upon launching the United States. He also discusses where there's been tremendous progress in the last year. I really liked Eric's response to Peter's question of where Zipline sees the operational boundary line between missions they would fly with platform one with their airdrop method versus missions Zipline would fly with the hovering capability of platform two and that type of delivery method. Great response. Listen in advanced air mobility there's always this struggle with product market fit. Many of the players in the market had been accused of having a technical capability and are in search for a market or a problem to solve. It is entirely refreshing to hear that Zipline started with a massive problem to solve in Africa. And from that impressive work have demonstrated success in medical outcomes in Africa are really just amazing What it really comes down to is how that success translates into a bigger, yet more complex and more competitive market in the United States where their unique platform two can deliver with precision on a dinner plate with almost no noise whatsoever. Listen from Eric and how they believe they can compete in this much different market. I really enjoyed preparing for this podcast, their CEO Keller Rinaudo Cliffton is very impressive. And Eric also has a passion and eloquence in telling what they've done and where they're going as a company. But I also like about Eric and perhaps it's just a part of the culture of Zipline is that he positively talked about what is possible versus the hurdles that he faces for example, in certification, where oftentimes we only hear about the hurdles and the difficulties of working with regulatory bodies. Perhaps, it's just another reason why Zipline is having such success. Eric thanks for joining us and to our listeners we hope you'll enjoy our talk with Eric Watson as you innovate The Vertical Space. Eric Watson has been at Zipline since 2016, where he is currently the Head of Systems Engineering, Certification, and System Safety. Two of Eric's proudest moments at Zipline have been helping set up the first national scale drone delivery system in Rwanda and achieving the first beyond visual line of sight operations with an onboard detect and avoid system in the United States. Eric is passionate about moving the UAS and autonomous aviation industry towards safe and efficient airspace integration and including a participation in leadership roles in UAS Standards, Development efforts. Eric has a background in aerospace engineering.

There's autonomous drones delivering products and dependent upon in different communities just really depends where you are in the world. so I think that's something that some people maybe don't realize or underappreciate and think that it might be some far off distant future, whereas there's other parts of the world that are, depending upon drone delivery services for healthcare, logistics, and other things that really make an impact in the community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you think is the source of this skepticism? We've heard this, as well. There's always those folks who for a variety of reasons are quite convinced that this is not going to work. Obviously we do believe that this is a huge market opportunity, but in your words, what do you see as some of the most credible criticisms and how would you respond?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, I'm not sure if it's, I'm sure there are some credible criticisms. I think most of the misconception just stems from a lack of it being tangible, right? Zipline's delivering, over 84 percent of the, health facilities in Rwanda and as an example, and we've started operations commercially in 2016. So. a number of years of experience doing this and I think for a lot of people in the world, that just feels distant, right? And there are areas in the United States that Zipline and others are, delivering to communities and providing access to different products and in a more efficient, safer, more green way. And I think that a lot of people hasn't been their backyard yet. Right. It hasn't come to them yet. And so it just feels like something that's less tangible and, and feels far off and distant. But in my opinion, being pretty close to the technology side and also having spent, years, working on unscaling this up and partnership with healthcare partners, regulators, different folks, it's really pretty obvious when you see it is my personal opinion, right? When you, if you might see either access that wasn't existent before, right? Didn't exist before and now exists. Or if you see someone order something or need something that's quite small, you need some children's Tylenol delivered quickly and a car shows up on your, in your street, throws the emergency flashers on and a person walks out and hands you a bottle of children's Tylenol that doesn't make a ton of sense compared to just being able to get something quickly and efficiently delivered with the right sized, autonomous, delivery system for the product that needs to be delivered in an efficient way. So I think once you see it and that the system's in action, I think it becomes pretty obvious, but there's just a lot of people in the world who haven't had the opportunity yet to be able to have that experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some have when you look at the operations that WING is conducting and also Manna, in Ireland and starting in the U. S. People who are experiencing drone delivery are, really excited and open and passionate about it. But there seems to be obviously those who drone delivery hasn't touched yet that remain skeptical about things like noise and, how really convenient this will be. Will this be available every time that I need it? So I'm sure we'll get into a lot of different aspects of this in the conversation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good point, Luka. Eric, I can't wait for you to tell the story of Zipline you know, how you started. The work you've done, providing access to important goods to those who have not had access, you know, it's a big part of who Zipline is. You've published, listen, meaningful outcomes in really well-respected journals with what you've accomplished in Africa. Is that what makes you different? Is that why you believe drone services are here to stay?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a great point and it's a great point, Jim. I think that this is a big, this is a big part of it. And it's very intentional, I think that anytime that you're bringing a new product, a new service to the world that didn't previously exist, I think it's important to be very cognizant of what the approach is, And Zipline focusing on some of the biggest problems initially, it was a very intentional thing for us to do. And so it makes for, it, in our experience, it has made for a community that has welcomed us in pretty much every instance with open arms. And so just to make that a little bit more tangible, I was in Rwanda and in 2016, helping to make those initial operations. And, yeah, and going out and talking with doctors, talking with lab techs and, people who ran the pharmacies at some of these health facilities. And when we started operations, I remember very vividly, first of all, just showing up at some of these remote facilities in more rural parts of Rwanda and being received like a, like some sort of rockstar, which is fun. and just being so thankful and so appreciative of the service that we were able to offer to help them complete their mission, like their life mission. and all the cases in my experience has been to provide those local communities with better medical care, And so just us doing our small part to be able to allow them to better execute on that mission has been a great partnership. And, the first piece of feedback that was just every single place that we went to early days was, when are you going to expand from 12 hours a day to 24 hours a day? When we first started, we started 12 hours a day service at, seven days a week through 365, but it was only 12 hours a day. And so that I remember, we were like any startup you're looking for product market fit. and we. we're optimistic, but you never know until you get there and so when you provide a new service to the world, to a portion of the world, and the first bit of feedback that you get is we want more of your service, is a pretty good piece of feedback, So, yeah, I think that's really positive. It's very intentional to, to start in those areas and to focus on those kind of beachhead markets that are maybe most in need or most, flexible and willing to be willing partners to go through any of the road bumps that happened in the first couple of years of a brand new service that you're bringing into the world. But I do think that's a big part of it. And I also think that, that point of enabling access to healthcare products, and then, also we're expanding beyond healthcare products in certain places That's not just the past, I think that we're super excited to expand to, we're now operating in seven countries and three different continents today and expanding on that. So that's, healthcare first and every one of those markets we're expanding into the UK with a partnership with the national healthcare system, this year. We have many of our partners in the U S that we are currently serving and also going to be launching with our healthcare partners. So this is not something that's unique to, you know, only certain parts of the world and it's not something that is Zipline's origin story, we're going away from, right. This is a core part of who we are and we're really excited to continue that mission.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, what was that discussion like around the table back in 2016 to bet the company on going so far away from home and picking Rwanda? What were the risks or the objections around the table that came up and how did you guys work through to that decision?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's a great question. So I think there's a misconception out there that we picked Rwanda. It's more that Rwanda picked us, obviously it's a partnership. It's bidirectional, but, there are a few things that were clear to us back then, and that was that we need to get the service into the real world to get customer feedback and learn quickly. We weren't going to be successful by, staying inside the building, and perfecting a system that had never really experienced customer feedback. That's not how great products are developed. So we need to get outside the building, start serving customers, and that's where we're going to learn. So that was very clear to us. It also was very clear to us that we need to solve the biggest problem first, right? And so that focused in, in healthcare in some of these areas where they didn't have, there were parts of the world that didn't have the best access to healthcare. So that, that had us looking in those areas. But then really, what we did is we ran a bit of a horse race, We were looking with different partners that met those criteria. and then Rwanda took the bet on Zipline. We were a small startup. Especially back then, and for the national healthcare system of, an awesome country like Rwanda, to bet on Zipline was, I think, a really insightful, profound and, risky thing for them to do at the time. and so that was just, it, I think Zipline's culture, we have a bit of a chip on our shoulder, if you will, to prove that this technology, has a really positive impact that it can make in the world and is a big part of the future. And that was just a really big bet placed on us on that partnership from the country of Rwanda and leadership within the country that we felt a personal responsibility to deliver on. which is a big part of us making the decision and going forward. and honestly, it also, the way you asked, the question in some ways, it makes it sound like we had a lot of choices, When you're a small startup, you have to, we didn't have the luxury of having a big, a big treasure chest full of gold, on our side. going in and proving product market fit, proving that there was community acceptance, proving that there is, a real market here was something that we needed to do in order to just to exist for another few years to give it a chance to get to the next level, So we had to be scrappy and pragmatic to go grow, Zipline and improve those things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. I know what you mean. You built a system for that mission, an airplane, with long range with the, airdrop method of delivery, which clearly worked for that mission. As you went through that design process for, what you call platform one where did you assume that that same platform could be expanded to in terms of other missions and markets?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Speaking honestly, that delivery experience, that customer experience has gone farther than we thought it would. We thought that, Hey, flying by and dropping a package in a parachute, into the kind of grass field next to the lab, for example, is this something that's going to, is this a great customer experience? We had some doubts, but it's scaled more than we expected, we're delivering, every day in, in Arkansas, for example, and in partnership with Walmart. since 2021 delivering, both, products from the pharmacy of Walmart, as well as other things from that facility, food, et cetera, to communities in outside of Bentonville, Arkansas, and our customers love it. It's like that same delivery experience has scaled into kind of suburban backyards in the United States. and again, in select communities are really quite well. So that customer experience in that platform has gone beyond what we expected when we were initially designing the system for that, for that specific use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you have a lot of experience flying with that and operations using that platform. Where do you guys now see being the operational boundary line between missions you would fly with platform one and with this airdrop method versus missions you would fly with the hovering capability and that type of delivery method?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So maybe a little bit of background here, just to catch him up who might not, might not know. So Zipline is developing, a platform two system as we call it, and and that system is focused on home delivery, as a vertical takeoff and landing electric aircraft, hovers to take off transitions to fly on the wing and then transitions back to a hover delivery site. Lowers what we call a droid. It's like a cute little robot hanging on a tether down from the aircraft that goes into the delivery area, identifies the right delivery site and leaves the package right where it's needed, whether that's your backyard table or somewhere else. so anyway, that's the, that's that next generation. Quick verbal description, pictures worth a thousand words. So feel free to look it up, but quick verbal description of the platform two system. and yeah, but great question. So we, the platform one system is really designed for long range missions, And so that is instrumental in, positively impacting, the healthcare system and, with our partners, which could be with national healthcare systems, or it could be, local, in the United States or other places, more like local networks, healthcare networks, and it's focused on more rural areas, the edge of suburban, some suburban areas, and then platform two is focused on urban and suburban, home delivery as, as well as moving products, Like lab samples between hospitals and more urban settings. and so that's the distinction is do we need long range and, and also have the ability for, dropping the package into a bit of a bigger area, or is this a shorter range, more dense area that really needs the high delivery accuracy and honestly magical delivery experience of the Platform 2 system?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Over the last year or year and a half, a lot of people in the industry, have been surprised by how much demand is and will be coming from home delivery, suburban delivery of high volume, low value goods like food, like coffee. When you look back to 2016, how did you prioritize these markets? what were your expectations in terms of, the growth opportunity for the healthcare B2B delivery versus Consumer B2C delivery.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We've been very focused on, on the healthcare space as supply and, upbringing that's core to who we are. with that said, and we think there's a real viable business model there that, that can scale. with that said, I remember, Amazon stated about 85 percent of products that they deliver are less than five pounds, So there's a clear need beyond healthcare for instant logistics and instant delivery of all the types of products and some of the ones that you just mentioned, retail, food, et cetera. And so we firmly believe that there's an opportunity for drone delivery and, Zipline being one of those providers to really make a positive change, not just inside healthcare, but be able to, make a positive impact for these other spaces as well, to deliver goods to homes, and other places, but, to homes that are in a more, in a safer, quieter, more efficient way than the current, mechanisms that are used for those deliveries.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric was your Africa experience, a net positive financial experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, there's no way that Zipline exists today without our experience in Africa. so\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But was Africa profitable.

Yeah, there's a, you know, listen, there's a part of me that says, why not just do that everywhere, delivering service to more remote areas. You know, you don't have the same air traffic issues you don't have the same certification issues. Your outcomes are through the roof. And, an argument can be made, just keep doing what you do really, really well, where there's a clear use case. But if you're not making money doing it, then that would explain why you would want to get into a more crowded space.ableit potentially a large market. But a very, very different market with a very different vehicle. But was that profitable?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So we're super excited that we're able to sustainably serve the communities that we're serving in Africa and everywhere that we operate. Zipline has, I think it just comes to the aspirations of the company, we're focused on enabling an instant logistic system that serves everyone equally in healthcare and beyond. And so while we are excited about the, both the mission and the business aspects of serving, communities that may have access challenges, there's more, There's, there's more that we believe that supply can do to positively impact the world than that. And so we're focused, not only on continuing to expand and scale those operations to, expand that positive impact, but also looking at, we feel like we're uniquely positioned to be able to make a positive impact in other areas and in other markets. And so that I think is the main reason for the expansion beyond those initial use cases is that, we're super excited to, to be able to do more. And it isn't a shift away from those core use cases. but it's more of an addition adding on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, can you give us a sense of the kind of utilization that you were able to achieve in Africa and, ballpark cost figures per delivery?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, super excited and a huge shout out to our operations teams in a lot of these markets that really blow me and a lot of the rest of the team away every day. we designed our, platform one system we thought initially that doing, if we could only do 150 deliveries in a day, that would be amazing. That'd be a huge impact. That'll be great for the business, great for the community, and we regularly do over 400 deliveries a day from a number of these facilities without really making many design changes, without doing much, just the operations team has found opportunities for improving efficiency, integrating, smoothing demand, integrating in a really creative ways with local healthcare systems. yeah, it's been really powerful to see the demand from the local communities just continue to increase, and that not just being within, the products we started with. We started in Rwanda, for example, we started with blood products. We expanded To medical products, medicines, vaccines, and, those are basically three of the core product categories that we serve in our, almost all of our communities that we serve, but also expanding into areas that we never really imagined, or at least didn't think would come this quickly. One example of those is animal husbandry, where we're delivering. different types of, artificial insemination products and, swine, semen and other things to improve livestock health and efficiency of those systems in these communities, which has a really big positive impact on the local economics, and different things within the community and health, within the community. So there's, it's one of those situations where providing, Logistic system and focusing on an initial use case that is really impactful, but then the creativity of our partners being able to identify other ways to use this logistic system to positive impact the community has increased volume and demand in ways that we didn't really think were on the horizon when we first started.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Eric, the 400 deliveries per day, this is with how many drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oof. yeah, sorry.

So one of the things that we've found is it's really important for success of the integration, into the logistic system to have, really deep buy in and support from the healthcare system that we're partnering with. but also Zipline's really excited whenever we can to bring additional funding into the mix, to, to support those operations. And, there's a lot of very generous organizations around the world that are excited to make a positive impact and see that their, dollars can make a pretty big impact when deployed in partnership with technology like Zipline's.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Eric, how does the experience accumulated in Africa operations translate to your aspirations in the U. S. and specifically how the FAA looks at this experience and, gives for lack of a better word, credit, towards certification and towards operational approvals in the U S what we have heard is not just, relating to Zipline, but, you can extend this, to military operations and other internationally operated, companies that wish to come to the U S that, yes, there's definitely a nod to flight heritage, but at the same time, there's pushback in terms of the operations not really being conducted in the complexity of modern and busy airspace systems, such as the national airspace system in the U. S. and so in your conversations with the FAA, how difficult of a conversation has this been and how have you structured and conducted and analyzed operations in Africa to make sure that it will be. acceptable to the FAA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a good, it's a good one. So two different things here. First is the positive impact on Zipline, we've learned a ton across the operations that we've done to date. we've flown in total commercial operations, serving our partners 65 million miles, more than 65 million miles, which is over 2, 500 times around the globe. I did the math recently, blew my mind. and so that much flight experience brings back a lot of learnings, And so we have continued to improve our product, improve safety, improve operational efficiency, with these learnings, better understand and characterize the environment in which we're operating in, weather at low altitudes, all of these things. So that's one is just that experience, not the for credit side, if you will, but just the product improvement side is really cannot be overstated. And then the second part of the question around. how is that flight experience, leveraged or considered in, in conversations with FAA specifically, I think that there's been somewhat of a shift here over the last few years in my experience where, I think that we're at a place now that the FAA is much more, taking a much more first principled approach, and much more open to those conversations where, depends what we're talking about, If we're talking about trying to take credit for the, the aircraft's ability to fly through rain, then, rain in Ghana is the same as rain in Utah, So it's very similar. and it, it's dependent on different variables, of course, but there isn't anything fundamentally different. And so it really depends on what is the area in which we're attempting to take credit or asking to take credit. And as long as we're coming in with, rigorously evaluating how does this compare, how does this data compare to the claims that we're trying to make and the operations that we're trying to conduct, then we've seen, especially over the last year, a pretty big shift to the FAA being willing and, good partners and evaluating that, asking the right questions about how is this different and how does this compare, but then as long as we're for, as long as we're doing our job from the first principles standpoint of making sure that, this data does compare, that it is useful in demonstrating this safety claim and that we're achieving these high safety bars, then we have had success using some of that data for credit and working towards FAA approvals.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there any aspects of Platform 1 that would prevent it from flying at scale in the U. S.?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>no, there's, yeah, no, there's nothing preventing platform one from flying at scale in the U. S.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right, let's put a pin on Zipline for now. We'll come back to it, especially as we, talk about scaling operations in the U S but let's zoom out a little bit and Eric, when we talked prior to the podcast about, possible themes, you mentioned that you thought we didn't talk enough about the UAS certification paths. So let's spend some time on that. Perhaps start from the top and let's assume that we want to start a drone delivery operation in the U.S. What are the approvals? what are the certification paths for the aircraft, for the operation? Talk us through the current uh, certification path, and also contrast that to what the potential future processes might look like.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So Zipline is a part 135 certified air carrier in the U. S. The, the reason that, that we are is because currently in order to conduct beyond visual line of sight, parcel delivery for compensation, those operations cannot be conducted under part 107 and the regulatory framework for conducting those operations is part 135. we're a proud part 135 air carrier. It comes with a lot of, a high safety bar, a lot of, safety based and operational processes. And the design approval side of that operational certificate that we leverage is, Section 44807 Exemption. And this acts as the design assurance side of what is the UAS, not just the drone, but the system that we're bringing in to conduct those operations under. And this is an area that has, when it comes to part 135 and also the design approval side there's been tremendous progress made over the last year. I think 2023 was a really big year in the U S and in partnership with FAA for not just applying, but I think for the industry as a whole in streamlining the processes towards demonstrating those high safety bars. For the high safety bar for those operations. And we're really excited about the progress that we've made over the last year, as well as we think this is just going to continue, all signs are pointing towards this, just further streamlining and becoming more efficient and I think an important thing that, the FAA in my opinion is really leaning into is, defining and maintaining a high safety bar, which is, all of our goal. but I think the FAA is moving in a direction that is more flexible in the standards and approaches for an applicant to demonstrate that they're achieving that high level of safety, Which I think allows more room for enabling innovation in the space. And I think, this could be in opposition to, or counter to really prescriptive set of requirements, So this is more, I think the FAA is moving towards evaluating what is the level of safety of the proposed operations and is that achieving the safety bar, that we've defined. So there's a shift towards being more into the future. There's an expected movement towards part 108, which is a new regulatory framework that, a draft should be coming out this summer from FAA is what we're hearing and we expect to be a continuation of what we're seeing in the part 135 and 44807 exemption, processes where there'll be further streamlining the approvals that, Zipline and others have worked to achieve under the current frameworks, we'll transition over into that part 108 world. and I think expect a very similar safety bar, but further opportunities for efficiency and demonstrating that level of safety. And I think that, the main change that I expect specifically is a movement towards more statements of compliance from industry to industry standards, consensus based standards. And so that means that there's, those industry standards are really important. And that's an area where Zipline, and others that, that we work closely with are really investing in over this year and into the next year is to make sure that we're set up for success, when the part 108 comes out and things are shifting every, every day they're shifting more towards, how is this approach how is this proposal demonstrating compliance with industry based standards, And so being able to ensure that we're working collaboratively as an industry to set up performance based and first principle safety based standards that then we can demonstrate compliance to is a key part of the future of UAS approvals, in my opinion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the ways that operators obtain a 44807 exemption? Is it typically through the D&amp;R process? Can you talk a little bit about that versus what has emerged as the more streamlined way through the flight standards, office of the FAA?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so Zipline received our first 44807 exemption, through a process that was, different than the current process, I'll say it's an evolving landscape. and that initial approval is carried over into the current method, as far as being grandfathered in, if you will, into the current method. And the current method is a derivative, I would say, of the durability and reliability based approach that you're referencing, where it takes a lot of the, a lot of the components from that, a lot of those same concepts of really thinking about it at the system level, as opposed to, piece part component level, the certification, and design approval. So it's really thinking about the system and let's define the operating environment and the limitations and everything for the system. And let's go demonstrate that this overall system, this UAS can operate safely and repeatedly in that design domain, In that operational environment. And so it is a very similar approach to that durability and reliability approach. I think one of the main differences is that the more classically the durability and reliability approach was done really in partnership, step by step with, FAA and with a lot of FAA oversight, and a lot of FAA agreement on, every document and test plan and all of these things, a lot of witnessing of testing, et cetera. And the new processes are more focused on, being compliant to industry standards and having company statements of compliance to achieving those very similar requirements. but having that slightly different approach has led to an opportunity for, I think, moving change management and initial approvals much more efficiently through the process while still achieving that same high safety bar.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the interesting, moves in my opinion has been, the shift away from dealing with the design. part of the FAA and more with the operational, the flight standards folks, if that is true, if you agree and you see this as well, how are those conversations different?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that there's more of a focus in the last year. Again, there's been a transition within the FAA and how they're handling UAS operations to have more of a focus on evaluating the safety of the proposed operation. And so there can be. that can be very, location specific, there can be different types of mitigations that can be put in place for different types of risk, but it's really thinking about what is the level of safety and is this achieving our collectively high safety bar, or is it not, And I think that is, is a different lens than looking at it from a very certification and compliance perspective. framework, right, of saying what are the specific regulations and is every part of the system in compliance with those regulations, is just a different lens to look through. and yeah, we've been pleasantly surprised with the shift and it's a movement more towards actually looking at the safety of the operations, which is more directly aligned with what I think we all care about at the end of the day. And so I think it's been a really positive shift.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what's the latest in evaluating the safety of the associated elements? What was it, maybe two summers ago that the famous memo landed and the industry, was very surprised. What was your experience like in proving safety and, obtaining approvals for, things like C2 Ground Control Stations. and how is the FAA dealing with it now?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that the. I think approach to associated elements that the FAA decided to take a couple years ago, is much more aligned and works much better with the more current approach of evaluating the safety of the proposed operation. I think it was a bit of a challenge to figure out how we then, handle different associated elements, different parts of the system with respect to showing compliance, to the set of regulations on the design side. But when, with a shift more towards saying, what are the proposed operations and what's the safety of these operations, then it becomes more, it's just more flexible, I think it's just a more flexible lens to be thinking through. And so we've seen, yeah, I think a fair amount of success of having the UA, the aircraft and the associated elements, all being considered as a part of the operation. and when it makes sense to treat them the same, we treat them the same. It wouldn't make sense to treat them a little bit differently. We treat them a little bit differently, and be able to have those categories to, to think through from a first principles safety perspective, dependent on what the proposed operation is something I think is working pretty well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You talked about future Part 108 leveraging industry standards. Where are the missing pieces today? Parts of the operations or technology that the industry is yet to agree on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I think when it comes to industry standards, in my mind, there's two different categories of progress that we need to make. One of them is there are just gaps, If you try and piece together all of the standards to, to paint a full picture, to put the mural together, there are some places where there are just some gaps. So those gaps need to be filled. And then I think another opportunity for improvement is, some of the standards that do exist that are, the right standards in the right areas, in some places they're maybe overly prescriptive or refer back to older processes or older approaches to things. And so I do think there's an element of the industry needs to align on updating some of these standards to be more performance based, and more flexible to support innovation in the space. Again, with that eye towards what is the risk level or this level of safety of the proposed operation? And is that achieving the safety bar? that's what matters at the end of the day. So yeah, I'm excited to, to, partner with other folks in industry. I think that, like I mentioned earlier, Zipline's going to be investing here. I would encourage any members of the audience who are potentially interested to get involved in this space. I think there's a big opportunity to move not only, drone delivery, but other drone applications, as well as honestly setting, in a lot of places setting the framework, for autonomous aviation, in a number of places. So I think it's a big opportunity and having, especially there's room for more operators with experience, more manufacturers with experience to, to join some of these conversations to make sure we're moving these standards in the right direction for the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, across those two categories, on industry standards, can you name some that are your highest priorities, whether gaps that need to be filled or standards that need to be revised?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'll put a plug in here there's a, operational risk assessment standard within ASTM that I'm, taking an active role in helping to update. this was a standard that came out in 2016 and we're planning on updating throughout the course of 2024. So this is something that is really an opportunity to look at, like I mentioned, what is that evaluating the safety of the proposed operation in a really smart way, and the industry, I believe, is lacking on the, an agreed upon process for conducting that type of analysis. And that includes, what are some of the equations that we use, what are some of the data sources that we use. And I think that the FAA has made a big step forward in better defining where the safety bar is. one of those, one example being FAA order 8040. 6A that came out late last year, which is, I think does a, is a big improvement to the previous guidance about where the safety bar is and I think industry has a step to take in order to agree upon what are the standard approaches, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the level of safety of the operation. So this is an area where I'm actively involved. There's a number of areas, that we both need to fill in some gaps as well as make some improvements to, to some standards, especially some that are a bit old and maybe out of date.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are any of these gaps or, missing standards, a direct obstacle for the industry to grow over the next one or two years,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the good news is that we're in a transitionary period, right? And so we're still, while part 108 is being developed and putting into practice, we're, we're still operating in this part 135 and section 44807 exemption world. And. That includes a combination, It's a combination of working directly with FAA in some areas and being able to take advantage of some of the standards that do exist in other areas. And no, I don't think that there's anything that is a direct blocker to industry right now. I think it's more of We need to do the work to set ourselves up to fully take advantage of the, process improvement opportunities that are, being, being placed in front of us. So I think that I don't see anything that's a blocker today, but I do see some opportunities to further accelerate, the industry in the future while again, still holding that high safety bar. Finding more efficient ways to demonstrate that level of safety with initial systems, new operations and new environments, design changes, et cetera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you see that the challenges around Boeing are in any way impacting the FAA, either in terms of their bandwidth or their appetite to engage with the UAS industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, not me personally. No, most of the folks that, that we work with at the FAA are, in the kind of emerging technologies side of things and the UAS offices. and yeah, we're, we're excited to have a number of partners on the FAA side who are focused on the UAS space, the companies like, Zipline and others to find the right ways to integrate UAS into their space in a safe and efficient manner. So no, I don't see anything at a day to day level, with the folks that we're working with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric as Zipline came into the United States and you saw how you wanted to monetize your operations here and you saw certification clearly as a hurdle. how was it any different than you thought it would be when you started.

And where we are today I think we're in a pretty good place. I think the industry is in a pretty good place from a, regulatory and technology and level of safety and all of these areas, compared to our expectations when we shifted some of the focus, when we added the focus of expanding into the United States, it's really in kind of 2019, 2020 type timeline. we didn't make as much progress as we hoped, so we got, I think we're at a place that we feel, we're excited about. We think that there's, we're really excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I think it took a little bit longer to get here than we expected to. but yeah, I think that we managed through and really excited about where we are. And I think the industry is in a really right place for innovation and also, scaling in the United States, and beyond over the next few years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And if you said there were two or three things that you took from your Africa experience that helped you operate in the certification world more effectively, what would they be?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think it, I think the main thing, and this is a little bit, zoomed out, but Zipline has always taken the approach of being very first principled when it comes to safety. The first question we ask ourselves when we're trying to go do something new, whether that's a new location, new airspace, new environment, new weather envelope, new aircraft, all these different things. The first thing we ask ourselves is, what is the level of safety that we need to achieve for these operations and how do we have the confidence that we have achieved that? And early on in the program, we'll say, what do we need to do in order to look back and what does success look like in the testing or analysis that we're going to conduct? The next question, once we have that plan, we've identified that level of safety, we've identified the process to get there and convince ourselves. Then the next question is, what's the regulatory pathway, what do we need to show compliance with? What are the regulator expectations? And so I think that's something that isn't fully unique to Zipline, but I think is a little bit unique where a number of aviation companies start off with a compliance mindset. And I think that Zipline was founded on more first principles than that. Starting off with first principles, safety, and then also demonstrating compliance is a key part of it. But making sure that we're setting our own objectives, our own safety bar and ensuring that our operations are achieving that. I think that's something that, is in our DNA, That started back at the beginning of the company and I'm excited to, to see that kind of progress and mature over time, certainly, but I do think it's a key part of ZipLine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric you gave us a high level overview of the P2 platform that's in development.

I'm happy to get there, but in order to get there, I feel like showing a little bit of a origin story, I think might be important to set the stage for how we got to where we are. and so the Platform one system we've talked about a fair amount. Platform 2, we talked about being focused on home delivery in urban and suburban areas. And, this became really obvious to me as a need and the right next step for ZipLine in 2019. When, I was just reflecting recently on when this was exactly. In 2019, I was spending a lot of time in Ghana. working on expanding our operations there in the more kind of remote parts of Ghana and partnership with our, our healthcare partners, operations team, regulators, everyone involved, different airspace operators. And, there was a friend of Zipline, Joe, shout out if you're listening, who kept, he was a doctor, well connected doctor in Ghana and kept reminding me or telling me that, hey, it's great what you guys are doing in the remote parts, but we really need you in the capital city. We need you in Accra. We need you in Kumasi. We need you in these urban areas as well. and I wasn't so sure. I wasn't convinced. and. one thing that Joe did is he said, can I have a day of your time? And I said, yeah, of course. And so he took me around to some of the main hospitals in Accra and walked me into the emergency rooms and some of the places and introduced me and asked the doctors, the folks that, who ran some of those facilities, heads of the emergency room, when is the last time that you didn't have the medical products that you needed in order to, properly care for someone, and even, lost a life of someone that potentially could have been saved if he had the right products. and every one of those hospitals that, that I went to, that, that, kind of Joe brought me to, the doctor had a story within the last 24 hours of when that occurred.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What was the most common answer that they said Was it blood?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most common, yeah, most common would be, yeah, rare blood types, right? Someone in the middle of the night, rare blood type, and just couldn't get it, couldn't find a donor, couldn't find access to the blood bank, in time. yeah, that, that was the most common theme. and so that, that became pretty clear to me that, wow, right, this, we've really been focusing on some of these more remote areas, but there are challenges, not just in Ghana, then we did our homework, we did our homework, looking at other places around the world, and concluded that, hey, this is a, this is also a real challenge. That was, again, for me personally, that was when the light bulb moment happened where I was like, okay, in order for us to accomplish this mission of enabling access to healthcare to everybody in the world, we, we need another solution, right? There's a lot of people who live in urban and suburban areas and we're not serving them properly. And so that was a big movement in that direction. and then, fast forwarding through time, we're, we. Then I've, have been working over the last few years to develop our Platform 2 system. That's focused on solving this problem, Enabling home delivery and operations in urban and suburban areas, with, I think a pretty cool customer experience and delivery experience really focused on, everything you need in order to do that in safety as a top objective, quiet, really. precise and inviting and fun delivery experience. So that's what we've been focusing on. we have a really strong demand, which is amazing to see. We have lots of partners in the healthcare space and the retail space and the restaurant space, a lot of partners, and some of the main feedback that we received from those partners is just, when are you going to launch with us? When can we expand to these customers? and so that's, that's great feedback to have, demand signal from the market. So that demand's great. We've been able to make a lot of regulatory progress. as I mentioned, initial Beyond Visual Line of Sight operations and in the United States late last year, really being something that, that was a big unlock for Zipline. and that was, with our onboard detect and avoid system, being able to allow us to operate in different types of airspace with limited infrastructure on the ground, to unlock those new areas inside and outside of mode C, veil areas. So in, in areas near big airports where there's more requirements for transponding as well as, in areas that are not near big airports where, there's less cooperative airspace. we've now conducted beyond visual line of sight operations in the United States and, both different types of airspace inside and outside Mode C veil, which is huge. There's about a little bit more than half of the United States population lives inside Mode C veil areas. but that also means that a little bit less than half lives outside. and so being able to bring, access and instant delivery to everyone in the world really means we need something that can hit all these different areas. Right. And that, that demand is huge. the regulatory progress we've been able to make, which is, we, we see as a lot of these things being cross platform, it's not an approval for just this specific aircraft in this specific instance, but it's really paving the way, If we have this level of performance of a system, then we agree and we've gotten agreement from the FAA that we can safely operate in these environments. and so now we go design also the next generation aircraft to have, the same or even better level of performance, then, it'll follow that we will to get very similar approvals within the same, part 135 air carrier certificate to operate and add that new aircraft into our operations. And, and yeah, and then as far as where we are in the program, it's just, continuing to develop, bring up the supply chain, manufacturing, flight testing, all of the things that are required in order to set up and have the capacity and capability of the next generation system to be able to meet that demand signal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, you mentioned your conversation with Joe and, you know, I love that story about listen, even in a city, there's a requirement for instant access for certain goods. But how much of your valuation, is a function of your ability to deliver goods to areas that otherwise wouldn't get those goods. You know, whether it be an Africa or whether it be in the United States. Or how much of it is your ability to deliver same day services to the home, for example, where you're now competing in a much more, it's much more of a red sea. Will you always get a better part of your valuation because of your ability to deliver goods that are not easily access to more remote areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's absolutely both. it's absolutely both. I think that there's some really high value use cases that Zipline has been able to serve and, really humbled by the partnerships that we have in order to make those positive impacts in the world so far, and really looking forward to expanding that. I think there's unique value that we can bring into those spaces. with that said, there's also, there are other use cases, And, I, again, it's speaking for myself here. I, pretty recent, I have two little kids at home and pretty recently. I went to the medicine cabinet in the middle of the night in search for some Tylenol to help with a fever. And sure enough, we happened to use the last of the Tylenol the last time that we needed it and had forgotten to get more. and really wished that I could get a drone delivery on my back porch in 10 minutes, in that time. so there, there's those types of use cases\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in that situation, Eric. Great example. What's your competitive advantage? You know, there are a lot of big players now who want to be able to deliver that Tylenol in the middle of the night. Uh, I love how you talk about your ability to quote unquote, you know, deliver on a dinner plate. You're so exact and what you, you can land and because of your droid. But what's your competitive advantage and being able to provide that, is there a cost advantage? I know noise is significant and it's a very quiet aircraft. I know that you can land it on a dime or, you know, on a dinner plate, but why would you be better than somebody else who was also able to deliver that Tylenol in the middle of the night?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, I think there's a number of, I think there's a number of different factors. yeah, my speaking from that experience specifically, right. It's, the way that we're developing Zipline would be a far superior experience to what I experienced that night. just being able to quickly open up an app type in what I'm looking for and have it show up in 10 minutes. It exactly where I want it. Where I, can still just be wearing my pajamas and have my slippers on in the middle of the night. Like that was not my experience, right? The experience was, I was lucky enough to be able to have product delivered, As opposed to having to get in the car and, and go find a 24 hour, pharmacy or whatever it may be. but it. It takes time, So someone's got to be awake looking for that. and then it shows up in a 3000 pound combustion engine vehicle to hand you a, an eight ounce bottle of Tylenol, at your door in the middle of the night. that's just, so some of the things that we're focused on doing are enabling faster, more efficient, more kind of user friendly experiences, as well as being able to deliver on safer, quieter, more environmentally friendly alternatives, right sized for the mission, solutions. And I think that that has a number of different. benefits over the current status quo.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Eric, do you see Platform 2 flying first in the U. S. market, or do you see it flying first in Ghana, against the use case, that you mentioned?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, we're keeping our options open, just to be transparent. we're looking at both, We're looking at both expanding, Platform 2. 0 service in some of the international markets that we currently have, quite a bit of experience in, as well as looking at, bringing the system first to the U S we have strong demand signal in, in multiple geographies and there's uncertainty, there's regulatory uncertainty, there's different types of uncertainty. And so it's just really important for us that we're able to, as fast as we can, deliver on our side of the, bargain with our partners. And so we are keeping our options open and whether or not we go to the US or international first, but I will say that there's been a lot of improvement and a lot of progress made in the US from a regulatory standpoint and also a community acceptance standpoint that we, we've had really positive success with FAA recently, as well as our operations and that we've had in North Carolina, Utah and Arkansas, serving customers and delivering products as have been really well received by the local communities. And that puts the U S on the top of the list, Like that, that, that puts it in the conversation, which is something that in 2016, it wasn't the case, right? In 2016, it really wasn't an option to come to the US first with a new system like this. So we're really excited to see the progress that has been made such that we think that it is a viable option to take a new service like this and bring it to the United States first.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see. Can you share a story with the audience, sort of talking about the design philosophy that has evolved at Zipline, on the basis of starting in 2016? and building Platform 1, taking a very verticalized approach to building it because at that point in time, that was a necessity. And now as you come to design Platform 2, can you tell a story about how that philosophy influenced the design of Platform 2 and perhaps what you guys have learned since you've unveiled it, in terms of development and and testing that's undergone since then?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, this comes back to, I think, this is just a good principle for launching new products and starting new companies is Zipline since the beginning has been focused on providing a service and solving a problem. Not developing technology as the top priority. And so when we started on this mission, we were focused on, enabling access to healthcare and providing an instant logistic system that, that serves everyone equally. And we thought, probably naively that we would be able to go out and buy some drones and buy some, it was the first thought buy some drones and start operating them to, to help, solve these problems quickly realized after buying and testing some drones that wasn't going to work. and so then we thought, okay, we'll be the system integrators. We can go buy, a number of components, avionics, flight control systems, autopilots, assemble them all together, and then we'll have our drones that we can go start solving these problems with and serving these customers. and what we've found over and over again over the years is that, it's really tough to do, It's in order to achieve the levels of safety and reliability that are needed, as well as the kind of efficiency and economics that are needed in order to serve these spaces, we've really struggled in most cases to find off the shelf components that can achieve both of those things, They can achieve the high level of reliability in the really adverse, environmental conditions that we operate in, as well as can achieve the economic efficiency that we need in order to deliver the product that we need in the service that we need to deliver. so that has led to more and more vertical integration and more and more, pulling more components and hardware components, software components, et cetera, in house over time. and I think that's just, we're just doing more of that on the platform two system, as opposed to the platform one system where there are some components on platform one system, even today that we, that we would really like to be able to bring in house. and so we learned on that and kicked off projects to purpose design some of those components for both platform one and platform two. and the, and some of those components are going into platform two first, and then we'll be rolled back into platform one, when we do a design update after they've been proven on the platform two system. Yeah, really excited about some of the opportunities there, and I think that this is a, I think that there's a kind of a, competitive advantages, a bit of a moat here of being able to be a vertically integrated company in this space allows us to achieve the levels of performance, the levels of, safety, these different things that really enable the business and enable the customer experience. I think one more thing I'd add is that answer. The answer I just gave is not just applicable to drones, right? the drone is. a portion, it's an important portion, but it's only a, really a subset, a small subset of the total. Of everything that Zipline needs to do in order to provide our service, right. And if we provide logistic service with our partners, there's also, just to name a few off the top of my head, right. There's the software that's used to manage the fleet of aircraft to dispatch the right aircraft with the right level of battery charge to the right order at the right time. the software that the controllers use, our remote pilots and command use for monitoring the fleet. There's a fulfillment systems that we use to manage inventory. there's integrations with our partners. There's the ordering apps that we build. There's all of the. manufacturing and quality systems. There's, all of the ground systems that we use, the communication systems, all of the things, And Zipline is definitely not a drone company. We're absolutely, a company that provides, logistics services for our partners, and we're really excited about that. and that leads to a lot of vertical integration across the space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, what external companies do you use for any parts that you just mentioned, you know, from UTM to fulfillment and how much of it is home grown and how much are you using partners?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a combination of both. Absolutely. I say that we're quite vertically integrated, but also there are some really important partners that we have that have enabled zipline to make the progress that we have and that we're also excited about continuing to expand with in the future. Happy to name one or maybe a couple, but, I think one that comes to mind first is NVIDIA. Right. we're more and more increasingly, getting higher autonomy on board the aircraft and that requires compute. And so having the latest, state of the art compute on board that can achieve the cost efficiency, mass efficiency, and, compute capabilities that are needed in order to have the, the flying computer that, that a lot of modern drones are has, it's been a great partnership with Nvidia to be able to achieve that and set us up for scaling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about on the UTM side? Is this something that you're doing yourself? Are you using a USS, how does that work?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So on, on the UTM side, so UAS traffic management, we are a part of the Keysight initiative in Dallas and partnership with a number of folks in industry, as well as the FAA and NASA. and we also have, have experience in UTM and in our international markets as well. and Zipline develops our own USS capabilities and, another example of being quite vertically integrated in the space is, developing, building those capabilities to, to interface with other companies and UTM service providers in an efficient way that enables our business.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, quite a number of people that we talked to privately, are expressing skepticism about the P2 design, pointing to the complexity and associated cost of it and wondering whether Zipline can really be profitable in the delivery of low value goods with this kind of platform. What is it that they're missing? How do you respond to something like that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. it's, it's not an easy problem to solve, right? it is a complex, highly integrated system. and we have focused on providing, we focus on that home delivery use case from the beginning of the design and everything that is needed in order to achieve that, the high level of safety and reliability, the, the delivery experience, including really designing for noise, being able to integrate. So we want to be able to integrate really efficiently into our partner facilities to be able to create that. we, the terms we use, create a magical portal in the wall that allows our partners to ship products to where it needs to go really efficiently. So these are some of the aspects that we've been focusing on the design. As far as, some of the potential skepticism, You really need to understand the system that you're designing and what are, what the main levers are, So designing for, autonomy, designing for longevity of the system and, cycles on the airframe, designing for operational efficiency and high utilization. all of these factors, designing for maintenance, right? All, all of these factors are really key and being able to. to bring to life a highly integrated, complex system to be able to serve our partners and achieve the use cases that we're focused on achieving.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are some of the gates either in terms of, utilization or the level of automation or human involvement or, the cost of the overall system, or any other gates that you need to achieve in order to, be able to profitably deliver a cup of coffee with the P2.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, from the beginning, we've designed the system for scale. that means, manufacturing scale, that means operational scale, all of these things. With scale comes economic benefits. and so we're really excited to have, a lot of the partners that we have, across, healthcare space internationally in the U. S. I mentioned, national healthcare system. We're expanding with this later this year and the UK, the Cleveland Clinic in the U. S., and the retail space, Walmart and the restaurant space, Sweetgreen and others. really excited about our partners and how are partners in general are really looking to scale, They're really looking to not just do a demo, do a pilot, see how it's received, but be able to achieve levels of scale. And that's when the economics start to work out, right. Is when you're, is when you're achieving scale with some of these partners and some of these systems, that's when, yeah, the, it can really make a positive impact in the community. And also that's when everything starts to pan out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And when you say scale, what do you assume in terms of utilization of drone, let's say in the unit of hour, is that, 3, 4 deliveries, 5, 6, 7?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I mean, it, depends, right. I'm happy to give some, some rough numbers, but it depends. It depends on how far away you're flying. It depends on the weather conditions. It depends on a lot of factors. But, if we're, we're doing a couple to a few deliveries in an hour, that's a good, that's a good hour for an aircraft. And that includes, getting loaded, flying out to the delivery site, delivering, going back to, get charged and get loaded again. So yeah, being able to do, two, two or three deliveries over the course of an hour is a productive, utilization of the asset.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned NVIDIA and autonomy earlier. It's interesting. We recently saw an interview with ValorEquity, one of your investors. It was a much broader conversation around AI and LLMs, but Zipline came up as an example of the vertical AI investments that this firm is making and how Zipline has an AI advantage. What do you think about this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that our flight experience has allowed us to continually improve our system, understand the environment we're operating in, and continually improve the, reliability, robustness and performance of our systems. and I think that includes. In the autonomy space, That includes in the ability to automate these systems, make them more and more capable and safe and powerful as time goes on. And yeah, I do think that, Zipline does use, artificial intelligence techniques, machine learning, et cetera, in order to. better understand our environment and ensure that we're continually improving the safety and efficiency of our operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How much of AI is used, currently or importantly, how much of it has been used in Africa?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Like I mentioned, we're continually using the flight experience that we have in order to improve the system. And so, yeah, they're, from weather prediction to flight controls, to autonomy and perception. There's artificial intelligence that we've deployed in different aspects of the business where it makes sense. Again, coming back to the basics where. we're not a company that's focused on developing technology because for the sake of developing the technology, right, we're focused on providing a service, and really scaling our operations and the value we're able to provide. And so I do think that we have taken a pretty pragmatic approach to leveraging. artificial intelligence and advances in those spaces in order to further the mission and continually improve safety operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Got it. Eric, as you think about, scaling the operations in the U.

What's top of your mind from a strategic perspective?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I spend a lot of time thinking about this. I think one of the things that is really important to me and to us, as we're thinking about expanding more in the United States, specifically, is Identifying the markets and the partners and the airspaces and, the weather conditions and all these areas where we can provide an excellent customer experience. And an excellent partner experience. And, and the good news is that there's quite a few of those. it's not everywhere in the world, But there's quite a few of those where we have conviction that, that this year we're able to expand into a lot of these areas and so being able to just being really thoughtful about how do we expand the business in the right communities with the right use cases in order to set up that kind of, magical first experiences with the community and with our partners to be able to have those positive first impressions and then be able to layer on and expand and scale from there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about, relationships with, the likes of, the aggregators like DoorDash?

S.?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, we see a ton of demand, for people just want faster deliveries, straight to their doorstep with a great customer experience. There's tons of demand in the space and I think there's different ways to integrate into, that last mile logistics spaces. A lot of our partners, like I mentioned, are in the healthcare world, for both deliveries to, pharmaceuticals to homes, for example, but also for Inter facility transfers of, samples and different things to improve healthcare efficiency, which we're really excited about, but also in the, in the retail and in the restaurant space, there's, like I said, there's different ways that we, that we could integrate in, that a drone delivery system can integrate in. Currently our partnerships are with the, the service providers directly. So we're working with Walmart, we're working with Sweetgreens, we're working with these different, retail and restaurant companies directly to provide, delivery services directly to their customers. So that, that's where we fit into the space, but, yeah, we're just excited to, to make the biggest impact we can to enable, drone delivery and positively impact the environment and these communities. And so we're, we're open minded to figure out the best way to do that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Eric, when you work with these partners and when you think about the rate at which you expand the service offering. What do you see as the rate limiters to the expansion of drone delivery? Certainly in contrast, DoorDash itself was able to expand very rapidly, just because of the nature of the service. But with drone delivery and with the people and infrastructure that you need to put in place, what are the expectations, for what that's going to look like, the rate, and also will it be concentrated on a geographic basis, city by city, or will it be initially more spread out and then filling in with capacity over time?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good question. I think that, I think it's going to be somewhere in between, right, on both of those. So I don't expect that drone delivery will expand like micro mobility did where they're seemingly we woke up one day and there were scooters all over the sidewalks in some places. I think that drone delivery will be very thoughtfully expanded in partnership with, the federal government, with FAA and other partners, as well as with, the local community, but I also think that there's an opportunity to scale pretty quickly, So I think thoughtfully and, metro by metro or neighborhood by neighborhood, but I do think that there's an opportunity to grow pretty quickly. And as far as the, Go wide and fill in or go deep type question. I think the most likely answer is somewhere in between where, there's two, I think there's two different pulling factors. I'm not sure what the ideal answer is or the optimal solution is, but one factor is that as you build a pretty deep network in one Metro, there's benefits of that network, right? There's benefits of being able to provide quite a bit of service. different infrastructure, charging, logistics, all of these things that you really can provide more and more service more and more efficiently in those communities as you go deeper, which might lead you to, go deep in a place before going wide into multiple. But at the same time, we're super excited about the partners that we've, been working with recently and we'll be working with over the next couple of years, and a lot of those partners are regional, especially on the healthcare side, they're operating in certain areas. And so there's a pull from our partners to be able to grow and scale and launch quickly. And so I think there's going to be a bit of both where we'll go into one metro area, work on going reasonably deep, and then, jump in the next, jump in the next.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, what is the next five to 10 years look like in our industry? And how is it different than what most people are talking about today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:14:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I think it comes back to the kind of opening of the conversation where I think one of the main misconceptions is that drone delivery is, and, scaling UAS is somewhere off on the horizon. And there's a number of obstacles that are in the way. and I think that, really it just depends where you live, There are places in the world where drone delivery is here today and is dependent upon. And my expectation of what the next five years, 10 years looks like is, I'm really excited for being able to bring that to more and more communities, So I think that there's different types of aircraft that are, executing drone deliveries in different markets, different niches, that are all, working efficiently together in order to help everyone live a better, more efficient life for the environment, for, safety, for all of these things. So I'm really excited about the, and optimistic about what the future holds in this space and how it can integrate into the next five to 10 years of our life as we grow.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:15:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you've been part of a very successful company for many years. You know, it started in 13 or 14. What advice would you give to our innovators? Our entrepreneurs that are listening. That may be unique.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:15:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the main piece of advice is to an entrepreneur getting started today would be to tackle a real problem, I think that, it's all too often that an entrepreneur comes about with a technology or with a solution, and then they spend their time looking for a problem to solve. As opposed to coming in and identifying, whether that's through their own personal experience and pain points, or, through insight they may have into the market, being able to identify a real challenge and a real opportunity. and I would just recommend entrepreneurs to, to make sure that you're identifying that challenge, identifying the opportunity and staying focused on burning down the risk to making that successful, As efficiently as you possibly can. and sometimes that includes technology development. Sometimes it may not. but just making sure that we're, efficiently focusing on solving the problem we set out to solve.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:16:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you certainly did that in Africa. Listen, I've heard a Keller, your CEO and he delivers a really inspirational message. And their problem you guys targeted and how you solve that problem. I wanted to ask given the time you've spent in Africa, Eric, what message would you give to Americans\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:16:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good one. There's just so much, it's so interesting and you have to go experience it yourself, I guess would be my main message. there's so much that's different, but there's so much that's the same, and so it's hard to explain the, that, that spread of where at some, in some ways it's the same problems in the same world and in other ways, it's just so different. I think you can say that about, probably any two, two countries and different communities and, cultures and whatnot. But, but yeah, it's just been such a pleasure to, work with, the partners that we have and the communities that we've been fortunate enough to be able to make an impact in those spaces and in our own way. So yeah, it's just been a really positive. part of my life and my career so far.

Welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Robert Rose co-founder and CEO of Reliable Robotics. Listen, few have Robert's pedigree to create systems for autonomous aircraft with his work and leadership at Reliable Robotics, as well as from his position as Director of Flight Software at Space X and at Tesla, where they worked on bringing to market the first consumer automobile with fully unassisted self-driving capability. This is a conversation about autonomy. We discussed the arc of automation and what evolved in the conversation, the arc of safety in aviation from its early days to today. You'll notice how Robert will closely and consistently link autonomy to safety in the beginning, throughout and at the end of the conversation; an irrefutable argument. He essentially says autonomy is going to happen so get used to it. But he makes the hard medicine taste just a bit better by tying the key arguments to safety. We spend a bit of time on the motivation for pursuing autonomous flight by segment GA part 1 35, 1 21 with a safety imperative with automation being more required in the former than in the latter. After a few attempts, we eventually get to other reasons why autonomy is needed in addition to, and beyond the safety case. As we've discussed many times the podcasts, we discussed the need for autonomy for many of the advanced air mobility business models to scale, and to meet their financial projections. Robert discusses the autonomous capabilities of Reliable Robotics, and as Robert says, what makes them unique is their ground up designs for automation and certification, where it's more difficult for others to go back and design for automation if that wasn't the original intention. We spent a lot of time discussing the processes required to certify automation systems. And you'll notice that we make every attempt to quantify the addressable market for autonomy and for Reliable Robotics at each of its stages today and in the future. Robert deftly steers the path to the size of the overall aviation market. We try to stay focused on the addressable market in the next five years and what opportunities within Reliable Robotics are tied exclusively to the Caravan and how easy it is to transition the capabilities to other aircraft. Next is a really interesting discussion around the design of their air to air radar it's value, market size, and why build it on their own versus purchasing off the shelf radar and whether or not it's core to their autonomy focus or perhaps a distraction to that focus. This naturally leads to a discussion around their airspace integration solution, including capabilities from their own radar and integrating data from other sources and the dependency on those solutions. And a discussion around the availability and value of primary radar data, where some would say, including me, it's availability is a lot further away than most people think especially given justifiably how long it took to release secondary radar data to industry. Listen to what Robert says is his biggest upcoming challenges if he had to pick one. He wraps up his talk with great advice to entrepreneurs. Robert, thanks for joining us and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Robert Rose as you innovate in The Vertical Space. Robert's deep engineering experience spans over 20 years across aerospace, self-driving cars and robotics. Prior to co-founding Reliable Robotics, in his role as Director of Flight Software at SpaceX, Robert was responsible for flight, ground, simulation and data management software successfully launching and operating the first 10 Falcon 9 rockets, 5 Dragon spacecraft, and Grasshopper VT VL tests. He led the development of the onboards flight software for their first commercial mission to the international space station, for which he received special recognition from NASA. At Tesla, Robert brought to market the first consumer automobile with fully unassisted self-driving capability. He led the team through developing novel computer vision, human machine interfaces and control technologies resulting in the successful deployment of the autopilot 1.0 and the 7.0 version of Tesla's instrument panel. At Google X, Robert led a development team on a secret project combining AI techniques with practical robotic systems to bring advanced machine perception and manipulation technologies to large vehicles. Earlier in his career, Robert contributed to three\"Game of the Year\" award winning titles during his time at Sony PlayStation and worked at HP as a software engineer. Robert is a presidentially invited Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Robert holds multiple patents, a BS in Computer Science, a BS in Computer Engineering and an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Oregon State University. Robert, welcome to The Vertical Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, great to be here. Thank you for having me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First question, is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's a couple of different ways I could take this. I could take this, the, are you asking, Robert the individual or Robert the company? let me take the, company perspective. we started Reliable Robotics because we felt that somebody needed to cut a different path from everybody else in, in the UAM, AAM, RAM, new aviation space. We felt very strongly that somebody needed to focus specifically on autonomy and autonomy in the United States, because at the time, and I think this is still true today, I still hear from folks, people say, well, well, this is never going to happen. We're never going to have autonomous aircraft or this is never going to happen in the United States. It's going to happen in Dubai or New Zealand or Brazil or someplace like that first. Or people say, well, nobody, even if we have autonomy, nobody's going to buy it. Customers aren't going to want it. Pilots will never allow it. Passengers will never accept it. And I feel that a lot of these criticisms are still true to some extent today, or at least many people still hold these, and bring up these criticisms. We obviously, I obviously feel quite different. I believe this will happen. It will happen very soon. It will happen in the United States. I believe there is a path to bring this technology forward that, pilots and other stakeholders in aviation will accept. And we can talk more about that later. And I think ultimately we'll get to a place where passengers are going to accept it. this is the future. I think the near future is going to have orders of magnitude more aircraft in the sky, and the way that we get there is with greater levels of autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>when you say it's here, it's going to happen. and people are going to accept it.

This requires an aircraft that's capable of fully automated taxi, takeoff, and landing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now you mentioned, you have, you had a professional response to those who, don't always agree with you on something. And then you said you had a personal as well. So what's the personal?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I want aviation to be safer. I'm a pilot and I think there's a lot of people that get into aviation because they have that love of, grabbing the controls and, they are the airplane, be the airplane. And there's a part of me that I get that, I understand the appeal. I think, unlike many that get into aviation, I also appreciate it for what it enables you to do and where it enables you to go. And I value the where you can go with aviation more than the experience of aviation, if that makes any sense. And for me, I want more automation in the cockpit. to ensure my safety, the safety of my family and others that I take in the plane with me. I've had several occasions in my limited experience flying where I've gotten myself into trouble and I wish there was a land now button in the aircraft. I think there should be a land now button in all airplanes. not just a system that's certified for emergency use only, but a normal use Autoland gets you back into a safe configuration and on the ground. and we have aspects of this today in airplanes. we've got wings levelers and emergency autoland and autopilots that can do heading changes and capture an approach and do all of that, but I don't think that goes far enough. I think there's a lot more that we can do to make aircraft safer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, before we get into, the meat of the discussion, you used the word safety now, 15 times in a couple of minutes,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>two or three, exactly two or three\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you for noticing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>two or three years ago, would safety have been mentioned as much as the use case for automation or what was your value proposition a couple of years ago for automation and fully autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I feel like we've been consistent on this from the beginning. Now, I think the larger conversation this industry has been having has been shifting. And I think that's because folks or others are recognizing that, the way you get the FAA and larger customers excited about this technology is you do that through safety by improving safety. I don't know if that answers your question. is that what you're getting at?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, there's a piece of me that says, well, you can't argue with safety. although I question whether people will pay for safety, you can't argue with safety. But yes, the many people listening right now will think, oh, we're going to talk about automation, we're going to talk about fully autonomous flight, we're going to talk about the economic value, we're going to talk about pilotless flights, which is extraordinarily controversial. But in some ways, you've steered a path here that is not controversial. Who can argue with safety? And you're saying that's a deliberate act for a variety of reasons.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, if you look at what stakeholders in the aviation industry care about, safety is the first thing that they talk about. If you look at, well just step back and look at the history of technology advancements we've had in airplanes over the last a hundred plus years. why has anything in an aircraft changed? It's changed to make the airplane safer. Like that's not an accident. I actually would be interested in knowing about improvements that were made strictly for economic reasons. Okay, maybe winglets come to mind. But most technologies, or at least electronic, avionic technologies, are there to prevent accidents and save lives. Period. And I think autonomy fits within that same trajectory. Autonomy or autonomous aircraft. It is just, it is an incremental set of enhancements on top of the incremental enhancements we've been making over the last several decades. I don't see the advanced navigation system that we're developing a whole lot different than what has been done in previous years with GPS, ILS, and other radio navigation systems, and even going all the way back to light beacon navigation systems. these are all technology enhancements to help improve safety. the automated landing system that we developed, I think, fits within that same trajectory of, automated landing systems and automated approach systems that have been developed to date. Our automated take off system, which is really a take off rejection system, fits largely within what's been happening in the industry for, for decades on automated monitoring of aircraft configuration during take off and take off rejection systems, And finally, automated taxiing, I see that, as a bit more new and novel, but from a core technology standpoint, really just builds on systems that are already going into aircraft. and even now, it's, our automated taxi system, I would say, builds on taxi planning features that you have in an EFB now, and it's just taking that one tiny step further, to ultimately improve the safety of you, the pilot, the occupants of the aircraft, and the people that operate around that aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm sure a lot in our audience all have, pretty good familiarity with aviation history and the milestones that were achieved over the last century. But from your perspective and from the perspective of what you're building at Reliable, What are the key milestones along that arc in terms of putting in place the building blocks and setting the precedence for autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, we, and you're referring here specifically to the history of aviation. what are key milestones throughout the last century?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, Full Authority Digital Engine Control. Huge. I think we need FADECs in every plane. I think it's ridiculous that small aircraft, expect you to sit there and manage mixture and, prop speed and all of those other components. it, it should just be, fully automatic. At the very least, we should have auto throttles in every plane. Instrument landing system goes back to the 40s. I believe the first experiments were in the 40s with automated landing systems, and then that technology was further developed in the 50s, and then commercialized first in the 60s. I think it was the, I think it was the Trident, I think it was British Airways, I could be wrong, that first deployed that technology, and that drove, developments in fault tolerant computing, I think, is something we take for granted because the space race was occurring around the same time, but the first real commercialization of a fault tolerant computing system was an Autoland system. This goes back to the 60s. NASA in the 70s built, I can't recall the acronym, I just remember that it wasn't the best choice for an acronym, but they built a, oh, it was the Terminally Configured Aircraft Program. they built a flight management system that allowed you to specify a flight path through all phases of flight, takeoff, enroute, and all the way to landing. And they actually flew this, it was on a Boeing aircraft. I can't recall exactly which model. GPS also stands out as another huge safety benefit. switching from, ILS approaches, which require expensive, infrastructure to be installed at the airport and then maintained. By the way, the FAA has a small army of pilots that just do nothing but fly around the country to monitor approaches and to make sure all the radio signals are correct. Moving away from that and towards a satellite constellation system has gone a long way to improve safety because it's enabled so many more airports to have RNAV approaches. That's huge! Think about all the accidents that we had before from people messing up approaches and going visual before they should have, or scud running. a lot of that has gone away. It's gone a huge way to improve safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>let's stay on the history of flight. Talk about the arc of automation and aviation from the early days.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we go all the way back to the Sperry autopilot, would be the start of it. I believe those tests were done first in the 30s, and then instrument landing system, as I mentioned, fault tolerant computing associated with that developed in the 60s. I think other key moments, key inflection points would be, Automated descent systems that monitor depressurization events, and then will bring an aircraft back down, to a safe altitude. I don't want to get too dark, but there have been some accidents recently where if that technology had been in those Private aircraft, it would have saved lives, but it does exist in a few large, commercial aircraft. there's a GA Avionics manufacturer that, promotes this as a product. I don't know off the top of my head how many aircraft have actually adopted this system, but, That, I think, is huge. for us, that's very significant because, automated descent following a depressurization event, you've got there a system that at very high integrity is monitoring for an adverse condition or an anomalous condition in the aircraft. And without asking the pilot, it's taking over the plane and putting the plane into a safe configuration. It's descending down to a safe altitude to save the lives of everybody that's on board the aircraft. And we talk about, that as like a key inflection point internally, because that's a time when you've got, an automated system taking over from a human, and in a split second manner, acting to take control of the aircraft. and you can't find a straight line between that technology and the regulations. the closest regulation being 91. 3, the pilot is the ultimate authority for the safe operation of the aircraft. here you've got the automation taking that responsibility, and that's significant precedence for us. and a lot of the system that we're developing now leverages on that precedence, or builds upon that precedence, I should say.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, as we pursue, autonomous flight. Let's talk about the motivation for, this goal and let's do it on a segment by segment basis. So describe for each of the, part 121 operations or 135 or general aviation or UAS systems for that matter. Why do each of those segments really care about fully autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, so GA, 121, 135, and then you had UAS, which I assume you're referring to small UAS\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>correct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>okay, sub 55 pounds. The Box Droppers, as we affectionately call them. GA, I think, has a clear need to improve safety. there's this myth that is commonly propagated that aviation is the safest mode of transportation. And that's true for certain 121 operations. That's definitely not true for GA. And there's a couple of papers that were published in the last several years that dug into the data here and concluded that, flying small aircraft, and this is GA, and certain 135 operations is actually 8 to 15 times more dangerous than driving on a per mile basis. I found this shocking. my intuition was planes are probably not safer than driving smaller planes. I didn't know it was this much worse. and so there, the motivation is to improve safety. That then ties to a very clear economic or business imperative. if you talk to almost any small airplane manufacturer, they will tell you that the biggest impediment to them selling more aircraft is the significant other. I don't want you getting in that thing, or I'm not getting in that thing with you. And systems like, parachutes and whatnot have gone a long way to alleviate some of those concerns, but not all of them. My strong belief is higher levels of automation are going to improve safety and thus expand general aviation to even more people, which I think is very exciting. I know my significant other, my wife, would be very excited about this and much more comfortable flying with me if she knew that we had a land now button.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I agree. General aviation does have a much more pronounced safety problem, but what about part 121 operations and 135?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll take 135 next. I'll take these in, in order from smallest to biggest. So in 135 operations, you also have a safety imperative. Here you've got, aircraft that are frequently operated single pilot, frequently operated at lower altitudes in, More adverse weather conditions than what you would see in 121 operations. And the nature of the work, tends to be a little bit less, What's the word I'm looking for? A little bit less structured than what in 1 2 1 operations. safety management systems, for example, are not required of all 1 3 5 operations. They should be, but they're not. small 135 operations don't have the FAA requirement. certain operators impose. They voluntarily adopt SMS. I think that's great. more operations should do that. But there, I don't want to get dark again and start citing specific accidents, but if you Google around, 135 accidents, especially 135 cargo accidents, you'll see some very unfortunate events where, People have gotten themselves into some pretty sticky situations that could have been prevented with automation. so there's a safety imperative there. The business, motivation in 135 is a bit different. I'm going to say pilot shortage. that shouldn't be shocking to anybody, but the pilot shortage in the 121 realm is trickling down to the 135 realm, and it is vacuuming up pilots out of 135 operations at a very fast rate. I hear from operators quite frequently that turnover is extremely high. it's getting harder to recruit and retain people. Salaries are skyrocketing. And on top of all of this, because of the accidents we were talking about earlier, insurance and training and other factors are all becoming more expensive, so it's becoming harder to find people to run these operations. For some operators that I've spoken with, it's existential. They say that they may not be able to run their operation in the near future because of pilots, and so they need to look at automation. they need to look at ways they can, Get more people, trained up, which you can do with improved levels of automation, or move to remote piloting as our technology is moving. so finally, in the 121 realm, you've got some different dynamics. pilot shortage is definitely a topic of conversation, but, I think safety, it's not talked about that much publicly, but Congress has been bringing it up as of late. we've had a few incidents that have occurred at major U. S. airports that made headlines that could have been prevented with certified alerting and guidance and higher levels of automation. And I think the industry needs that to be able to keep operations efficiently flowing and to maintain public confidence in the aviation system. I don't think you can draw a straight line between pilot shortage and automation. I'm not ready to go there. I think some folks in the industry are trying to draw a straight line, but I think it's going to be several more years before, the pilot shortage is a direct driver of automation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>can you go a layer deeper, either in the Part 135 safety cases that you reference or Part 121, and give the audience some examples of a dangerous situation that occurred and the cause of it and how automation would have prevented it because obviously in aviation there are many different causes that lead to an accident. Some of them can be weather related, some of them can be, a failure of some part of the aircraft, or it can be a failure of communications. help us connect the dots between how automation specifically would alleviate certain types of accidents.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, I'll have to go back further because I I don't like to talk about recent accidents until the NTSB has completed their reports. I don't think it's appropriate to draw conclusions. but there was an accident about, a year ago involving, a Caravan pilot where, this hits pretty close to home for us, where they were attempting a, a landing, at an airport in northwestern United States, and the weather was pretty close to minimums, and they came down, broke out, and, were not able to make contact with, the runway, or they didn't break out, they weren't able to make contact with the runway, visual contact, they performed a go around, and it appears from the preliminary reports that I've read that, They decided then to descend, believing they understood the airport environment, broke out, and then, ran into some fixed infrastructure on the ground. And, this breaks my heart because, there's just no reason they needed to die. If they'd had a system that enabled, Zero Visibility Autoland, if they had a high precision navigation system that gave them a glide slope and localizer that they could track, then they could have shot this all the way down to the ground through the clouds and missed that fixed infrastructure. Some have speculated that it was a poorly designed, approach procedure, and the runway and that fixed infrastructure never should have allowed an automated approach, but, there's ways to do it. could have had a slightly higher glide slope, and we could have given this person something that would have saved their life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>as tragic as it is, it's not a case for adopting a remotely controlled aircraft though, right? How do you draw a line from that to remote control of aircraft as being the answer, as opposed to other safety enhancing, tools and systems on the aircraft from, navigation, better situational awareness, et cetera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the first system that we're developing is a fully automated aircraft that still has a pilot on board. our first step is not remote piloting. our first step is give the people in the cockpit, more sophisticated tools to prevent them from getting in those situations. And that does lead eventually to remote piloting, but there's a lot of other technologies that have to be added to the aircraft in order to enable remote piloting, such as air to air radar and more robust, communication systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you talk to your customers, part 135 mostly, I assume, do they admit that they have a safety problem? Is that what the business case revolves around?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's a substantial component, and for the reasons I mentioned earlier, there's, it comes first from a genuine desire to not put people at, a higher level of risk than necessary. If we can do something to prevent accidents and save lives, then damn it, that's what we need to do. and the customers that we talk to, the customers we spend a lot of time with, that's what they say. This is about saving lives. Having said that, there are other benefits that come along with it, once you move to remote piloting. I mentioned earlier, training, training becomes much simpler, much more straightforward. being able to reposition aircraft becomes much more straightforward. Being able to up gauge and down gauge the aircraft, flying aircraft that is appropriate for the mission or right sized for the mission is another benefit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>tell us how your concept for remote operations, how that is fundamentally different to how the military is operating its MQ 1s, MQ 9s, or for that matter the QF aircraft series.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>our system is more like Global Hawk than the old Predator system. we don't have a joystick. there's no rudder pedals. there's no live stream video feed that lets you hand fly the plane down to the ground. our system Works, very much like an FMS, because it is an FMS that we've modified, and in fact, the first system that we're certifying, the system with the pilot in the plane, they're programming the aircraft through our flight management system. It's a slightly more, sophisticated flight plan than what you would do today. Today, you would go into a plane and you would program your enroute portion. maybe you would program your departure procedure and your approach procedure. But if you did those things, there would be potentially discontinuities in your flight path. And maybe your FMS will alert you to those discontinuities. A few systems actually do that. Many will just be happy to let you fly off, out over the ocean and never actually intersect your approach. And then while flying, air traffic control, and for other reasons, you may need to change altitudes, you may need to change headings, and that deviation from the flight plan is not managed by your FMS. So our FMS manages all of that for you, so you don't need to ever Disconnect the autopilot and hand fly the aircraft, we do it all. And we do that at a level of safety that far exceeds autopilots today. So our system on the ground now uses that exact same FMS. you're programming the aircraft, just like you would if you were in the plane using our system. What else is new? You also have a Traffic awareness, feature that's built in. So on top of our moving map, we plot traffic and our system provides certified or will one day be certified, today it's certifiable alerting and guidance, that maintains safe separation from other aircraft and will modify your flight plan for you. it also enables, voice communication to the aircraft. So there's a headset connected to our system and it works just like it does today. You dial in the frequency that you want to talk on. There's a push to talk button and your voice is streamed over satellite to the aircraft and then broadcast out the aircraft. So surrounding air traffic control, they hear you. Just the same way they would if you were sitting inside the plane. And conversely, you also hear everything just as if you were inside the plane. So we did it this way because, we're trying to do the simplest thing possible that can integrate into the existing airspace system. And I emphasize this because there's Folks out there that talk about, digitization of air traffic control, I think that's exciting. We're part of an RTCA group that's working on that, but I think that's a very long ways away. today The airspace works through charts, sectionals, AFDs, and people talking to people over amplitude modulated VHF. And so if you want to integrate UAS, that's the way you've got to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Robert, given that there's so much experience across the General Atomics platforms, the Northrop Grumman's and some of the others. if there was a solid business case in the commercial market, Wouldn't you expect those same players to service part 135 operators?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know how much of this is public. so I'll speak in generalities, but major military drone manufacturer you've heard of, I know, has attempted to market, the system to commercial players and has attempted to push, their aircraft through an FAA certification process. And I, I think the short story there is, it's hard. it is really hard to take something that was not designed with certification in mind and modify it to be certifiable. the Certification process, and not just the certification process, but the set of standards that the FAA has recognized, that should be used for certification, take your systems engineering all the way back to requirements. and if you don't have the evidence going all the way back to the very, very early days, mapping the requirements for your system and why everything is exactly the way it is and precisely how you have tested everything to ensure that it meets those requirements, it's hard to go back and do that after the fact, and for those that are listening that are familiar with DO 178 software, there's common stories in there about how you can't just take something from a prototype and then snap your fingers and make it certifiable software. It just doesn't work that way. So it's hard for these military manufacturers to make that transition. millions of flight hours does not a certification case make. You need to be able to hit factors of safety in the 10 to the minus 8, 10 to the minus 9 realm. That means the acceptable failure rate is, depending upon the size of aircraft, one in a hundred million hours of flight, or one in a billion hours of flight. You can't fly a plane for a billion hours and say, well, we only had one accident, therefore, it's certifiable. I'm not smart enough, but there's a RAND paper that goes into this too, that says that even a billion hours isn't sufficient to show one in a billion. You got to go way beyond that in order to get any kind of statistical\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, right. I guess where I'm going, Robert, is when we look at the Enabling technology blocks that exist on these platforms. And there's been some recent examples where, one of these big OEMs, have integrated into civilian airspace in the UK, they do have a certifiable platform. So what's different in your system approach? On a fundamental technology block that stands in contrast to the approaches that you're seeing by these and other players,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so you used a phrase there, fundamental technology block. And maybe I'll disappoint your listeners a little bit that I don't feel there's anything fundamentally different about what Reliable Robotics is doing from a technology perspective. What we're doing that's very different is our systems engineering approach. We are looking at this from day one with certification in mind, which means a thorough understanding of the regulatory construct for Highly automated aircraft and charting a path through the regulations, through existing published guidance by the FAA. Well, by the FAA, I was going to say and others, but we are nearly exclusively focused on the United States and building a system that complies with That set of regulations and guidance from day one. I think that's what makes us different. And when you approach it from that perspective, it leads you to make different technology decisions. for example, our air to air radar is not a military target tracking radar that consumes a tremendous amount of power, takes up a bunch of space and costs I don't know how much to manufacture. It's going to cost a lot less. it's going to meet exactly the requirements the FAA has, Published that they will accept for air to air radar for detect and avoid, through TSO C 211, 212, I believe, and nothing more. and that's going to result in a system that complies with those requirements right out of the gate and is probably an order of magnitude or more, less expensive than the systems that have been developed for military applications. I would also say the same on our communication system, our ground control station. Human factors is probably the biggest area in the FAA certification process where subjectivity creeps in, and that's where there are fewer standards to leverage, and what you really ultimately need to do is convince a number of subject matter experts in the FAA that the system does not Impose an undue burden on the pilot, and is consistent with human factors best practices, which change year to year, month to month, day to day. And that, that also needs to be designed from day one with a civilian aviation use case in mind. and that's where it's probably not a custom user interface that's point and click. it probably looks a lot more like the user interfaces that the FAA has accepted to date. and that's why our, design decisions track more towards a classic FMS and not something completely new.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so whenever somebody makes a safety argument, the bar is really high, obviously. So how can, anyone pursuing autonomous flight Reliable Robotics included, make a convincing case that what you are developing is safe in every conceivable condition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, this just goes back to what we were just talking about. The way you show a system is safe is you follow the published guidance, that the FAA and EASA have long accepted. There are standards. There are system engineering process standards that have been around for many years that are used to develop the Boeings, the Airbuses, the Embraers, the Part 25 aircraft of the world. And the way that you convince the FAA and thus the public that it is safe as you follow those same processes. I fundamentally disagree with folks that say because it's autonomous, because it's new, we need to invent new processes. That's completely bogus. We have processes to do this. It's just, it's a very hard, it's an arduous path. That's how you do it. That's how you get to 10 to the minus 8, 10 to the minus 9 and beyond.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we talked about the fact that, the military systems have not been able to prove it after millions and millions of flight hours. What's your view on the path to getting there? In terms of, data collection, time, whatever metric that you are using to track your progress along that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The metric that we use to track progress is how many regulations have we demonstrated compliance to so far? And there's processes for each. this is how certification works. You map out the regulations. you establish a certification basis, that says these are the regulations that are appropriate. You establish a means of compliance, an MOC. Fancy word, but just means how are you going to show that you meet the requirements. the, and then within each of that, there are processes. collect data, collecting data is a trigger phrase for me. You triggered me, it really irks me when people use that expression because I think, well, for what purpose? why are you collecting data? what system is this that you have where enough data on its functioning makes a safety argument? I'm not comfortable with a system where people say, well, because it worked for several thousand hours or because we did so many auto landings with it, it's safe. That's just bogus. That's not the way these processes work. That's how you get to 10 to the minus two. maybe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>obviously data is important. Obviously showing a track record is important when you talk to the regulator. how do you then view this challenge of proving to the regulator that in the absence of data\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>no, there is, I'm sorry. The collecting data is a trigger word for me because people talk about throwing their Autonomous plane up in the sky and building hours on it and collecting data so that they can further improve and modify the system. and then they, there's a double speak there where they often tie that to certification as if the FAA is going to say, Oh, you've flown 10, 000 hours, it must be safe. Okay, go for it. That's just irrelevant because it matters what it. You need to understand, like, well, what conditions did you operate the system in? did you just burn holes in the sky endlessly for 10, 000 hours? what were you really doing? I, we could take our plane and go burn holes in the sky over Mojave and perfectly clear weather with no other air traffic for 10, 000 hours, but what did we prove? Nothing. but\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it's configuration management. It is the right data logging. It's the right data management. obviously, it has to be structured in a way that resonates with the certification processes and all of the other applicable regulations. Absolutely. But, that's table stakes And so once that is understood, Talk about the development process, where you get comfortable and you get the regulators comfortable that you have achieved a certain, maturity level where you can field this to an aircraft and have confidence that whatever conditions they might encounter, the system will work and be safer than when the pilot is on board.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll go back and explain the certification process. There are hundreds of regulations that impact what we're doing. and each regulation has, Congress passes laws, FAA creates regulations that are, in compliance with those laws. The FAA then publishes guidance. on how they expect applicants, like us, developers of aircraft systems, to comply with those regulations. So within that, they publish guidance on, I'm trying to think of an example. regulation. says that automated landing systems need to be certified. and then they publish, an advisory circular that says, here's how we, the FAA, believe you need to demonstrate that you meet the regulation for an auto land system. And that, that one line regulation or paragraph may expand into a 700 page document. That 700 page document may reference other advisory circulars. It may reference industry standards. Maybe RTCA has published some guidance on how to tune a radio system that uses radio navigation for the purposes of auto landing and what the performance requirements of that system should be. This all expands out into thousands and thousands of pages. We actually summed all of this up, recently. we're well over, I think it's 27, 000 pages of documents, that we've brought into our system that are all FAA standards and publications and guidance that the FAA has put forward and blessed as applicable for Complying with the regulations. And these are just the ones that impact our system. There's actually much, much more in aviation more broadly. And so you have to dig into each of these standards and pieces of guidance that the FAA has published to get answers to questions like, well, how many hours is enough? Or how many flights is enough? How many landings is enough? In the vast majority of these cases, our certification approval that we received earlier this year, maps to about, I would say, 90 95% ish to things the FAA has already put out there. The stuff that doesn't match is dealt with in issue papers, and there, we've either proposed our own standards. We've said, hey, if we were you, FAA, this is the standard. And we just made it up. This is what we think the standard should be for this type of system. And we've gone back and forth with the FAA. It's taken many years, but we've gotten them to agree that's a reasonable standard for this thing. And now that's the standard that we're going to follow. In other cases, we've taken existing standards and we've proposed tailoring them. We've said, for example, the auto landing standard for Part 25 aircraft has a lot of really good stuff in it, and we're just going to leverage that, most of it, 98 percent of it, for Part 23. There's a few areas that we don't think are applicable to Part 23. Don't ask me off the top of my head what they are. we got the FAA to agree to that. Okay, so now you get into, let's take Autoland for example, I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but the Autoland set of standards, and this is hundreds of pages of documents that explain this, state that for you to get an automated landing system certified, you first have to build a very high fidelity simulation of your aircraft, and you have to show in simulation that the aircraft can hit essentially all possible, foreseeable, combinations of environmental conditions and aircraft configurations within whatever envelope you are intending to certify. So if we say that our system is good to 15 knots crosswind, then we need to show that for all density altitudes, and for all crosswinds, plus or minus 15, and all weight and balance configurations, and all aircraft configurations, and all possible, internal system failures that the aircraft could be experiencing, it will always bring the plane down to the ground within our performance window X feet laterally, Y feet, longitudinally, et cetera, and we're never going to exceed the G load limits of the aircraft. then you take the simulation, then you, from that, you say, okay, well, how do we verify that the simulation matches reality? And you have to choose test points in the real world that give you confidence that the sim is representative of the real aircraft. So you may want to pick the worst case aft CG configuration at the worst case density altitude at the worst case crosswind component, and then you have to go find a place in the United States to go do this. And that's why you go out to a place like Casper, Wyoming or whatever, and you stay out there for a couple of weeks until you hit that test point. And then you hit all your test points and say, okay, boom. Now, the simulation is good. We comply with all the Autoland requirements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in developing autonomous systems, you can broadly bucket into data, algorithm development, and testing, which one of those three do you see as the most challenging?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Say that again, algorithm development and what?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>broadly data, and in that it might be data collection, data annotation, warehousing management, so broadly the data bucket, then it's the algorithm development, and then it's the testing validation and verification. So if we can high level those three categories, where is your biggest focus now? what's the long pole in the tent? and where does a startup have an advantage over an incumbent?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>can I see what's behind door number four? I, I think, I wouldn't pick either of these. I would go to the certification basis, I think is the biggest challenge. And that's the area where a startup like us can have the biggest positive impact. And that's why we started the company. I don't think, I don't think collecting data is, a huge technical challenge. that's solvable. Algorithms, while complicated, are just algorithms, and that's just work. and the testing is just work. It just, it's something that you just have to do. the really hard part, the most challenging task in all of this is to figure out how the autonomy maps specifically to the regulations,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>while we're on the topic of Algos, can you talk about the software that's behind your autonomous features?

Most of us are pilots on the call. how much of the situations that one may encounter in flight do you feel that your software can be programmed to appropriately address?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If we can anticipate it, and this gets back to the processes that I was talking about earlier, there's a safety assurance process that's used in part 25 aircraft that we're using for the development of our system, where you enumerate all of the possible things you can imagine that will go wrong and you decide how will the system aircraft and pilot manage it and how to prevent a potentially hazardous or catastrophic outcome as a result. We're going through those exact same processes here. The difference is, we just don't have the pilot inside the aircraft to act as part of the system, if that makes sense. And it's hard. it's a lot more work when you don't have the human in the cockpit as the final node in your fault tree, to save the day and you don't get to defer the problem to training, then that means you need to implement an algorithm to, to solve it. And if we can imagine it, then we need to implement code or some feature of the system to mitigate that hazard. If you can imagine a hazard, we need to mitigate it. Period. That's how it works. Or we need to convince ourselves that it's like extremely improbable, like beyond 10 to the minus nine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>48:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>a lot of these, situations you cannot imagine ahead of time. So when is good enough, both good and enough, who makes that call? goes back to to how do you with authority stand in front of the operators, the people on the ground, the regulators, and say, we're good.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, maybe I'm not getting through. It's following the processes that the regulator has approved. That's how you do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So let's talk about cert, the processes, and if you don't mind explaining your certification path, and I'll just reference, one of your competitors, I think in 2021, petitioned the FAA for waivers for, a remote operation and was denied. how are you planning to avoid this situation? Can you give us a little bit more detail about your cert plans?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we don't intend to get in that situation. I am not surprised that their request was denied. there's a reason we have the certification process in the United States. And, I don't think they made a compelling enough argument to, short circuit that certification process. and so what we're intending to do is to follow the certification process. Our system is an STC that goes on top of the existing aircraft that's already type certificated, modifies it to enable remote piloting, and then the Part 135 air carrier certificate and the operation specifications associated with it need to be modified to support the STC. Much like today, if you have a 135 and you want to I don't know, fly CAT 2 ILS approaches, you have to write that into your OPS spec. You need to demonstrate to the FAA that you have sufficient training procedures to, teach your pilots how to run a CAT 2. they'll be the same kind of thing with our system where if you want to run our STC in your operation, you're going to have to write that into the OPS spec and you're going to have to coordinate with the FAA and get permission to do that. So for those of you unfamiliar with how airlines work, certifying an airline is just as complicated, if not more complicated, than certification of the on board equipment, the aircraft itself. the FAA gets very deep into how an airline runs itself, and the procedures that airlines use. There's a few obvious things like, pilot training that they get very deep into, because all airlines have chief pilots and chief pilots are responsible for, ensuring that everyone is sufficiently trained and there's standards that they need to follow. Safety management systems is another aspect that the FAA gets very deep into, and how, airline operators build and maintain safety culture is a big part of that. Maintenance is another obvious feature that the FAA gets very deep into.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right. Hey, Robert. so let's take a breath and let's go in a different direction here. Great discussion. How big is your addressable market today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, are we talking about today right now? Because I don't have a product yet. I don't have a certified\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>you had a product today. How big is the addressable market?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, our system is designed to be aircraft agnostic. And our intent is to take this STC, that we're first working on in the Caravan, and then modify it so that it can be put onto other aircraft. It'll be somewhat straightforward to do this for other Part 23 aircraft, a bit more complicated to do it for Part 25. But if we're including, Part 25, in your question, then the addressable market is huge. It's basically all of aviation. aviation is close to a, what, a trillion dollar industry now, drives four and a half percent ish of global GDP. and we think that we'll be able to access a very large portion of that. I should say to our business model, because I think this is important. is not just to provide the equipment. We don't want this to be a one time sale, but we're also providing all of the training and infrastructure necessary to install, deploy, maintain, and operate the autonomy as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are people willing to pay for today? And why? By market. And how much of it is safety driven?

And five years from now, you define the size of the market by the trillions of the size of the aviation market. But realistically, Let's say you're in front of a group of investors and they're thinking, is this a company, is this a space\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, you think I wasn't being realistic?

Let's see for your audience, let me decide how to answer this, because well, first, the most naive way to look at it is, okay, you're automating the aircraft. That's a function currently performed by the pilots. Well, what portion do, pilots contribute to the cost of aviation? And the answer to that is on part 25 aircrafts, it's close to 20 percent and on part 135, it's close to 30%. In some cases, it's 35 percent or more. A naive way to look at it is, okay, if all we do is reduce piloting costs, then it's 20 percent of the 800 something billion dollar, Part 121 world, which is a big number.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>54:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But Robert, it's not that autonomy would replace the pilot, it would just move it, right? There would be efficiencies in centralizing these pilot services so you can spread them around the network and make the network more efficient, that is for sure, but it wouldn't be a one for one replacement or removal of the pilot.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would think that autonomy is necessary for replacing the pilot in Part 121, but it's not sufficient. There are a lot of other things roles that the pilot is playing in the airline and in the operation of that flight, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, and I don't want to say that it diminishes that cost to zero, but it is a substantial reduction. some of that I think still needs to be tested, and we're working towards testing it as soon as we have our STC. We'll be able to, to go test out this and validate the unit economics, but it is a substantial, we are anticipating a substantial savings Right out of the gate. just by having the pilot sit in a control center, the effective utilization of that pilot goes way up. this is especially true in 135 operations, where, pilots typically fly less than two hours a day. And having them in a control center, they could fly a lot more. But then, that, I don't think that's looking deep enough that's, as I said, the naive way to look at it, the very, the oversimplification, where this gets quite a bit more nuanced, is when you look at how you can change the way your operations work, now that the pilot is in the control center. And the first thing there that we hear from operators that's most important to them is repositioning. Freeing the aircraft from the pilot, and this could even just be a completely empty plane that just needs to deadhead somewhere, a repositioning flight, would drive huge operational efficiencies. determining the value of this is complex. It depends on an operator to operator basis. But the feedback that we've received from many of them is that this is a substantial driver for them. The second is being able to, right size the aircraft, up gauge or down gauge. if you're remote piloting and you're flying an airplane that has a much more simplified interface, and the automation is taking care of all of the aircraft's specific details for you then, you don't necessarily need to be specifically trained, aircraft to aircraft. And so you can switch flying, one morning you might fly a Cessna Caravan, and then the next you might fly something like a Cessna SkyCourier. You can't do that today. It's not considered safe. It's not safe to have people trained up to fly multiple aircraft simultaneously and be jumping around back and forth because it's hard to maintain proficiency, across different aircraft types. maybe some pilots would disagree with me. I'm going to take that position, and there's many operators that take that position, even within, like, variations of the Airbus fleet. there's some operators I know, they will not let their 320 pilots that are trained to fly one avionics configuration fly the other because they don't consider it safe. So, remote piloting, you can now do that. and that, it also enables a huge amount of operational efficiency, being able to right size the aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what do you see as the time horizon for Reliable to be able to realize that vision? I want to tie back to Jim's question, on that five year time horizon, unlocking value for the company. You've been focused on the Caravan of which, roughly 3, 000 have been manufactured in its lifetime. a subset of those are in a type of operation that falls within your target market. But what does it take to expand the footprint of your product via STC into other platforms? How much time does that take? And does all of this happen within the time horizon that Jim laid out in his question, as we, we drill down from the top level market size down to the direct market that you can capture in five years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The key inflection point for us is, once we've got this system certified and operating on one aircraft type because of our focus on certification and the certification basis and all of the tools that we've developed to enable these, processes and analyses to be performed, don't anticipate it to take all that much time to transition the technology to subsequent aircraft. So I see an inflection point for us where once this is certified on one aircraft, boom, we can quickly scale to modify it and deploy it to other aircraft. So the time horizon question in my view gated or the critical path is on getting this very first system certified. That's the focus. so then you're going to ask me, well, when do you think that's going to happen? And it's hard to say. for all of the reasons we've been talking about previously, these systems engineering processes are very complicated and when you start digging into the details, you find things and it's hard to predict when you're going to be done. I can tell you when I'd like to be done. And I can tell you the dates that we have in mind, the team is tracking. but it's challenging to predict because nobody has ever done this before.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is your development path of a radar capability, is that on the critical path to what you're describing here?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The radar itself, the hardware, the software, the signal processing, no, the certification basis, yes, that is a component. I wouldn't say that's the, the biggest thing that's keeping me up at night, but it's certainly, it's a, an important component. The FAA has accepted, a set of standards for air to air radar. To my knowledge, nobody has yet driven that all the way through the certification process. We will likely be the first, and we're going to encounter things when we do that, and it's hard to predict how long it's going to take.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so when you, embarked on this project and you did the breakdown of, okay, well, are there ways that we can acquire this data? And I know that you have, done a lot of thinking on that. are there ways that we can lean on the supply chain to get a radar solution that meets our needs versus, what is the, time and investment and risk involved in developing our own? walk the audience through what those choices looked like and how you settled on this path?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, this is a recurring theme or nightmare of my career. we, we dealt with a lot of this at, previous companies that I'd worked at. you're trying to do something new. You're trying to put a product out in the world that nobody has ever done before. And you want to do it as quickly as you can. And so your mind goes immediately to, okay, who can we partner with? who can we get this component from? Radar was one where we had been trying for a very long time, to convince another set of developers, I won't mention any names, but companies you've heard of, to go build, a radar that meets our requirements, or rather meets the requirements the FAA has already published. And we've said, if you build this thing, we will buy it. And we've got customers, and this is how many units, you can expect us to purchase from you on this rough time horizon. And this has happened with us, with radars. It's happened, with actuators. It's happened with flight computers, with IO concentrator computers. It's happened with, our communication system. There's a couple of these key components that we didn't initially set out to build this ourselves, but we ended up deciding to bring it in house because we either, couldn't get anybody else to build it for us, period, we couldn't get anybody else to build it on a reasonable timeline, or we couldn't get anybody else to build it at a reasonable cost. And with the radar in particular, that was one where we went back and forth for a very long time, and eventually it just became clear that we're burning more time trying to convince this other group to go after this billion dollar market opportunity when we could just be spending this time building it ourselves. And at least then we build ourselves, when we encounter issues deploying it, which we inevitably will, it will at least be a misery of our own making.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So let's dig in on that project. what are the deficiencies that you are trying to address with this in house R&amp; D to build a radar that meets your needs? What are the gaps between what's available and what you want? And what do you see as the resources required to pull it off? Radar is not like a weekend project, right?

If we were having this conversation five years ago, I think you would be on much firmer ground to say that we're crazy. But now much of the signal processing technology, has become commoditized through deployment of global 5G networks. Antenna manufacturing is still, really tricky. and there are a few areas where we are still partnering, but, we're now the main integrator of the component. I'm not answering your question. You went to, What was the first part of your question again?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first part of the question was, the required resources and the gaps that you're trying to close between what's available in the market and what you need to have a radar solution that works in the National Airspace System for autonomous flight. And then what are the resources required to pull off that R&amp; D project and what is the, risk profile of that undertaking?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Roughly speaking, the air to air radar requirements for an autonomous aircraft, the reason you're putting a radar in there is to comply with 91.113 see and avoid requirements. And RTCA, a major standards body has been publishing, Minimum Operating Performance Standards for air to air radar systems for several years, the FAA has accepted, some of this work through, the TSO publications that they've put out. the requirements for those radar systems are largely a function of encounter speed, and within that, you have a range and resolution and tracking requirements, so you need to be able to see something at a certain range, you need to be able to infer its velocity at a certain amount of precision, and then you need to be able to track it, at some particular rate, and you need to be able to track a certain number of things, and you also need, a certain amount of visibility, vertically and horizontally. so those are the requirements. so this might be, I don't know, you might need to see out to 6 or 7 nautical miles, for example, and you may need to be able to see another aircraft that's moving 400 knots relative to you, for example. that then, it just goes to radar physics, and from radar physics, you conclude, okay, well, if we're going to use this radio frequency spectrum, then we need something this size and this power, and we need this many antenna elements, and then you go out to the market, now to answer your question, you look at, okay, who has a radar that meets these requirements, or is close, or could modify something to meet the requirements. In there, radar developers, fall into three buckets. you've got existing aviation certified radars that are designed for weather applications. those have incredible range, but the resolution and tracking is not sufficient. You've got military radars, which definitely have the range, definitely have the resolution and tracking capability, but they are tremendously expensive, they're huge, and they consume a lot of power. And it's hard to imagine how installation of some of those systems would be practical at scale on a Part 23 aircraft. And then you've got, sort of new entrant radar manufacturers that are using clever algorithms to do things at lower power with less, radar reflectivity information, and it's tricky to see how they modify those systems and scale them up, because they don't currently meet all of the requirements. And so that, that investigation led us down the path of, okay, let's try and convince one of these folks that are operating in the radar development space today to modify their system to meet the FAA's requirements. And that's ultimately what led us to where we are today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What technologies do you foresee being an important and necessary onboard part of an aircraft, as opposed to, being offered as a service? What do you think is the right combination for the mission that you are pursuing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think what you're question, getting at here, is what are the key technology components that are necessary to enable autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Especially in the context of detect and avoid, obviously you can have a radar onboard, which you are pursuing, but you can also, and you've had some experience, so maybe you can share some of the, insight with the audience here in terms of, asking for primary surveillance data from the FAA radar feeds. how do you think the market evolves around what ultimately gets equipped onboard versus what gets offered as a service. And then how does that change depending on the mission?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, I see what you're getting at. I think of the technology that enables autonomy in two different categories. Step one of autonomy is to have an autonomous aircraft. an aircraft that can manage itself through all phases of flight. The second thing you need is you need an airspace integration solution that integrates that autonomous aircraft into the system that we have today. And I see these as distinctly different things. Autonomy, or the airborne automation component, consists of all of the things that you would need to do automated taxi, takeoff landing. You need also a high reliability vehicle management system that can manage the fuel, circuit breakers, and all of the other subsystems that exist on aircraft, to keep the aircraft in a safe configuration. And now once you have that, once you have an aircraft that's capable of flying itself through all phases of flight, then it becomes a question of, okay, how do you integrate this into the airspace? And that's where you need to comply with 91.113 see and avoid requirements. And that's how you end up with the air to air radar. You need to communicate with air traffic control and surrounding aircraft. That's how you end up with the communication system. We have a dual redundant satellite communication system that we're working on certifying. And then finally, you need the ground control station, and to satisfy all of the human factors requirements associated with, with that interface.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>but specifically see and avoid, where do you see the, the market converging, onboard radars or, surveillance data that is provided as a service.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's actually long term it's going to be a fusion of many things, because air to air radar is good at certain things. Primary surveillance radar is good at other things. camera systems are good for other types of things. and so I think we'll see, a fusion. Our path that we're taking, now, and what we believe will first be accepted by the FAA for aircraft the size of the Caravan will be an air to air radar system, and that will meet the requirements and allow us to do operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can you tell us about your experience requesting primary surveillance data from the FAA?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, so primary surveillance radar, for those not familiar, these are radar systems that were initially put together by, a lot of them were built by the U S air force, for national security purposes. And then the data was released to the FAA for air traffic control purposes. They've since been augmented with transponder data feeds, and the combination of the primary radar with the transponder feeds, is frequently referred to as secondary surveillance radar. and the pictures of air traffic controllers, the screens that they're looking at is, is a terminal that shows you a fusion of primary and secondary, surveillance radar. Or frequently just secondary, but, they have the capability to see primary as well. Primary surveillance radar, in the United States, and there's some publications that the Air Force has put out there on this, is pretty incredible. There are very few places in U. S. airspace that are not covered by primary surveillance radar, and for the types of operations that we need to do with small cargo aircraft like the Caravan, it's possible to fly the Caravan and stay within primary surveillance airspace with sufficient margin to see all of the things around that aircraft. And we've shown through a variety of simulations. There was some work that we did with NASA several years ago on this. we've collaborated with some folks at MIT Lincoln Labs, on this as well. We've shown that you can actually use primary surveillance radar to solve see and avoid in certain airspaces in the U. S., not all, but in many of the ones that are economically relevant for our use case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Robert, does that account for the, the update frequency of primary surveillance radar and the latency in getting that data to the aircraft?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it's really a function, too, of, well, how it gets back to what I was talking earlier, about air to air radar requirements. it matters what air speeds do you expect to see encounters and how much separation buffer do you want the system to have. And so in areas where the update rate and resolution is lower, it just means you need to fly further away from other things that the radar picks up in order to maintain sufficient margins.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the update rate?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That I don't know off the top of my head.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, what's the likelihood you would get access to primary radar in the next couple of years at scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, so we actually had access many years ago. I think we talked about this in that article in The Air Current. and that was partly how we demonstrated the efficacy of PSR for solving this problem. and then we went to go do another set of test demonstrations and our access was revoked and the message that we got back was that too many other groups had taken notice of what we did. Word got out and so a lot of other people started requesting access and then somebody raised the specter of national security.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>without a doubt. it took 20 years for secondary radar information to be provided to the public. I can't imagine what it's going to take for primary radar data to be released. Again, at scale. testing is one thing, but at scale is another.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:14:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But we anticipated this and I, let me, I don't want to let that drop. We care about national security. I care about national security too. We anticipated this and we proposed a number of processes that the FAA and the DoD could use to secure the data. We even went so far as to, suggests that the data only be accessed within locked facilities that are access controlled and follow a variety of NIST standards for cybersecurity and none of that was accepted. And my understanding is, the FAA is continuing to look at this. They are making progress with the DOD on how to release the data. I've even had executives in the FAA tell me that they think it is in the interest of national security to release the data because if they don't, then it means private companies, potentially foreign owned private companies, might stand up their own radar networks and have better surveillance in the airspace than the United States government does.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stand up their own primary radar within the United States, foreign governments?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Foreign owned companies may do this, and I would say that there are private companies today that already have stood up their own radar systems at airports.

We started this airline. We view it as an incubator and this gets to what we were talking about earlier with the certification of the airborne component and modifying the Ops spec for the airline. We decided to bring that portion of it in house so that we can modify the OpsSpec ourselves first in a very small airline, relatively small airline, I should say. And once we figure out how to do this and get the FAA to approve it, our intention is to then license it out so that other airlines can benefit from it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what do you see as the optimal position to occupy along the value chain?

OEMs are going to benefit because autonomous versions of the aircraft are going to sell much more than other versions. Maintenance providers, FBOs, are going to benefit because there'll be different maintenance challenges. We were talking earlier about ground handling complexities with remote piloting and how we're going to figure all that out. And fixed base operators and others are going to benefit from that. Component suppliers are going to benefit by pushing the technology out. Airlines, obviously, are going to benefit through operational efficiencies. Where we see ourselves fitting in is we want to provide a few of the core components, not all, but a few of the core pieces of equipment, and we want to provide the certification services to get the equipment put into use. And I'm talking about the airborne component as well as the Airline operations component. And then there will also need to be ongoing, services, communication services, as well as detect and avoid and other cloud based, aircraft management components that you'll need in order to be able to run this technology at scale.

On the one hand, they are developing very rapidly. They're able to do tighter iterations. They're able to fly a lot more hours. On the other hand, they're, building their innovations in a different airspace regime, below 400 feet, different requirements for that. But I think one could argue that some of the technologies that are being matured there are advancing very rapidly and, have relevance in the rest of the airspace system.

I'd give you almost the same answer. in order to meet the certification requirements, the regulatory requirements, you've got to take it all the way back, to the beginning. And while I'm sure there are lessons being learned in the small UAS space and, we're benefiting from work that's been done there, early work with Beyond Visual Line of Sight, the core components and the regulatory basis, I don't see that carrying forward. It'd be like saying an autonomous fork truck in a warehouse is going to turn into a self driving car.

Maybe that sounds a little too cliche. There's a Werner von Braun quote that I love, and I think he said this sometime around the launch of the Saturn V. Wernher von Braun was the designer of the Saturn V. and he said, I've learned to use the word impossible with the greatest of caution. And there have been a few points in my career working at those companies that you mentioned, SpaceX, Tesla, where it hit me for a moment, I felt like I understand what he means when he said that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:21:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:21:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This company, Reliable, we're doing things that many people told us before we started were impossible. We're still told it's impossible, and I just refuse to accept that. We will find a way. I think we need to do this. I believe this is the next big step that humanity needs to take. I think we need autonomous planes to further connect people and connect the planet. I think this is going to be a bigger transition for humanity than the jet age was. the jet age shrunk the planet, and autonomy is going to shrink it even more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:22:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>and, don't pivot off this question.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:22:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, alright, I'll try.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:22:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>is your biggest concern in the next couple of years, your ability to execute on the technology or the market's willingness to pay for that technology?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:22:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I definitely don't think it's the market's willingness to pay. I don't think that's going to be a problem. However, I would pivot slightly on the technology that I really think that certification is the challenge. Certification is the challenge. We need the FAA to do this. This takes a massive public private partnership, and, I know I'm the one you're speaking with, but, and I'm representing Reliable Robotics, but I also feel like, the FAA has a big role to play here. And it's of crucial importance that Americans especially take note of this and inform members of Congress that the FAA needs support to do this. If we want the United States to continue to be a leader in aviation, we need to be putting more resources into the FAA. We need that FAA reauthorization bill done.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:23:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And with all of your experience in running small companies and with working with large, great companies, what advice would you give to our entrepreneurs on the line?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:23:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First, build a product that people want to buy.
