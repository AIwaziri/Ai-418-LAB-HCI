Everything else is fundamentally limited, either from the technology, infrastructure, market applicability, or safety and regulation sides. And hybrid threads the needle perfectly right now. And everything else you have to place a bet on an unknown that's completely out of your control. Whether it's battery energy density or hydrogen costs or infrastructure. And hybrid doesn't place any uncontrollable bets. It's just about good execution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Kevin Noertker Co-founder and CEO of Ampaire. For those of you who've been listening to many of our last several podcasts discussions, especially those with Rob Britton and Jeff Luckett, you'll find our discussion with Kevin a perfect follow on. After discussing areas where some may disagree with Kevin, we launch into an overview of electric aviation. And the industry that blossomed due to its introduction. Kevin also discusses that the electric-only industry hasn't seen the battery progress that many had hoped, which has pushed back the timelines of many fully dedicated electric vehicles. We also discuss how electric only vehicles especially eVTOL have more limited near term use cases. We then talk about hybrid propulsion versus electric propulsion. We discuss what parts of hybrid propulsion are changing the fastest today, and it's different and unique use cases. We then discuss why an operator in regional air mobility would select an electric vehicle versus what some would consider the more obvious choice of hybrid electric propulsion. We delve a bit deeper into regional air mobility and how overall electrification may increase the use of regional air mobility. We discuss the pluses and minuses of pure electrification hybrid and traditional aircraft on regional air mobility as well. Kevin wraps up our discussion with some great advice for our innovators and entrepreneurs. Kevin, thanks for joining us for a terrific discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Kevin Noertker, as you profitably innovate in The Vertical Space. Kevin Noertker is co-founder and CEO of Ampaire. Over the past eight years, Kevin and his team have pioneered practical, compelling electrified flight through the upgrade of existing aircraft types. In 2019, they flew the world's largest hybrid electric aircraft. In 2020 and 2021 they deployed and demonstrated electrified flight with multiple airlines across the globe. With over 23,000 miles flown hybrid and 12 plus regulatory flight approvals across three countries to date, they're a leader in hybrid electric aviation. Prior to Ampaire, Kevin contributed engineering and program management expertise to advanced aircraft and satellite technology development programs at Northrop Grumman and as a research fellow at Caltech and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An entrepreneur at heart, Kevin is driven to apply the science and engineering disciplines of large aerospace organizations to pressing environmental problems here on Earth.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, Kevin, welcome.

The first is, we're in sustainable aviation and there's a lot of talk about new design planes and new markets, eVTOL and, high speed new design jets. And first is, I believe that we need to start with propulsion rather than airframe design. And there's a whole lot of good that you can do with new airframe designs, but novel propulsion is how we've seen these transformative moments progress in the past, whether that's the dawn of powered flight or the jet age. And I think you need to get the propulsion right before you start doing the transformative vehicle designs. There'll be a lot of people out there that might disagree with me on that one.

All the new technology waves in aviation revolve around or are enabled by new propulsion. So what is it about this particular statement that, the industry disagrees with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's the idea that you need to do the new airframe design with the new propulsion in the first embodiment. Ampaire over the years has gotten a lot of pushback from industry stakeholders about doing upgrades of existing aircraft types. But you can't capture the full opportunity, they say, by upgrading an existing plane, you really need distributed electric propulsion, or you need the new airflow augmentation, or your vertical lift features, and that they believe that those features are going to drive the adoption dynamic, and that propulsion retrofits which is the path Ampaire has taken, is not a sufficient starting place. I think that's where the differentiation comes in. Because certainly eVTOL, let's take as an example, requires novel propulsion. what I'm saying is we can decouple those as a first step. Not to belittle the benefits that you would get from a clean sheet design, or maybe it's ultra short takeoff and landing performance. But the fact that designing a plane around propulsion that is not yet certified, that does not yet exist, is a recipe for having to redesign that plane half a dozen times. And we've already seen people burn a lot of capital going through that path this turn of the wheel. But if you just look in history, I mean, this is new design planes that didn't do it around existing propulsion. That's one of the big gotchas in the, in the design space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And there was another thing that you wanted to flag.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This is going one layer down there for propulsion. Hybrid electric is the only approach that makes sense right now. There are many exciting technologies. Obviously, fully electric is a dream many of us have. There's some corner cases where fully electric might work. There are a lot of people pushing hydrogen, but the reality is just like on the ground. Hybrid electric is going to lead, it is the gateway technology to this future. And I think it's going to be the gateway technology for decades.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I didn't expect a different answer from you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'm talking about, anything with commercial relevance, where operating flexibility, that is range, payload, airports that you can fly to and from, anywhere in the economics, anywhere that matters, and you need to get to scale, hybrid electric is what'll get you there. Everything else is fundamentally limited, either from the technology, infrastructure, market applicability, or, safety and regulation sides. And, hybrid threads the needle perfectly right now. And everything else you have to place a bet on an unknown that's completely out of your control. Whether it's battery energy density or hydrogen costs or infrastructure. And, and hybrid doesn't place any uncontrollable bets. It's just about good execution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, elaborate on this point a little bit. Why is it that the industry doesn't think that hybrid is the way to go?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think back to when we founded Ampaire. And I think back to a lot of the people in this industry who have such deep passion for making a positive impact on the world around us. And those core motivations for many are about usually one of two things. Either they care deeply about the environment and they want a true zero emissions solution. And that forces their designs into a fully electric or, a strong hybrid where you're flying fully electric for some period of time, or a hydrogen where they can claim a, zero carbon emissions in flight, if it's a fuel cell. And so what you see is this desire to have a pure carbon, remedy. And that causes people to not prefer the hybrid electric type approaches or these hybrid approaches where, you know, 50 percent fuel savings, 50 to 70 percent in our vehicles is phenomenal, but it's not zero. And if you're here on only principle and unwilling to look at anything but the pure solution, then that would bias you against it. The second is, there are some people who are pushing toward this idea of you have to start with the absolute simplest, simplest possible architecture, even if it's not possible today. And electric is phenomenally simple. And the maintenance costs are super low, and in theory you can get the economics to play out, depending on your battery assumptions. And if you believe, if you have certain optimisms in that area, then you don't want to give yourself the complexity or the crutch of having to do the partial via hybrid solution. And I think that keeps some people away from it because they say, oh, batteries will get there. Like, let's just wait around for those. But I think they miss the point that if you can serve, 10 times the market size by using hybrid electric, and you're saving half the fuel burn on that. That's, do the math, it's five times the positive impact of a few or zero emissions on that one tenth of a market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Let's talk about electric aviation. Zoom out a little bit, catch us up on some of the major milestones in electric aviation over the last several years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, electric aviation has had some pretty amazing progress in the last decade or so. The earliest companies in this industry were founded in the, 2010s but very few were talking about them at that point in time. You had the starting of, the NASA X 57 program. By the time Ampaire was founded in 2016, there still really weren't that many companies that were publicly acknowledged doing work in this space. Since then, we've seen this, this, blossoming of ideas, of concepts, I remember, the first time, I think, Peter, you were, you might have even been there at the, Uber Elevate Conference out in Dallas in 2017. There's this industry that built up around the enthusiasm for electrification. And then you saw hundreds, I believe the number peaked at over 700 different projects in this space. A lot of ideas, a lot of people who really get excited about designing airplanes. And, want to go through the features. So, big milestones. You've had first flights, whether those are the flights of the Pipistrel Alpha Electro, or ultimately that being delivered to customers around the world. You have the first flights of various development program aircraft, Ampaire's first flight in 2019, and, subsequent iterations, for example, our, Caravan flight in, 2022. The industry's also made progress from, simple demonstration of flight capability to very specific capabilities. So in eVTOL, the progress of transitioning from vertical lift to fixed wing flight has been a, a big challenge where still only a handful of companies have safely made that transition or done so with a pilot on board. These are critical milestones that will drive confidence in adoption and ability to gain regulatory approvals on the, on the operations. You've seen some incremental progress along the battery energy density. standpoint, so a lot of folks are waiting for batteries to have significantly higher watt hours per kilogram, so the gravimetric energy density in the lithium ion batteries in particular. And we've seen some modest progress on that and some really amazing announcements. Some groups who are in the chemistry side trying to, get up toward, past 500 watt hours per kilogram, targeting 1, 000 watt hours per kilogram, pretty audacious goals. I think, the industry hasn't yet seen, as significant of progress as many had hoped, and that's, that's pushing back timelines for entry into service of the fully electric, fully electric vehicles. And then from a certification standpoint, some pretty big milestones. Back to 2018, where we were kicking off a ASTM committee around electric vehicle chargers, through all the SAE committees or other industry groups working together on certification. While these might not be the visible milestones that hit the press, there's certainly the milestones and progress that help move the industry forward. And so, watching folks get their first certification bases established, or get a, get means of compliance agreed upon, or special conditions, moving forward, ultimately looking, I think here in the next few years, we'll get the first full, regulatory approvals for commercial operation. And, and each of those are some of the very meaningful milestones that are, happening real time and coming up soon.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the surprises for me was, the lack of certification events following Pipistrel's EASA certification of their, Velis Electro aircraft in the LSA category that was back in the summer of 2020. And then earlier this year, I think in March, the FAA issued an LSA airworthiness exemption for that same aircraft. But here we are four years later and no other electric aircraft has been certified. Why do you think that's the case? What's the bottleneck? about the.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think the, there are a few things. One is, the regulatory basis for certification. And the Pipistrel products didn't fully open up the Part 23 or the vertical lift, certification arena. it was in a different category initially. And I think that while it made progress and maybe others could have taken their products through that same, the, you know, the identical regulatory pathway, many of the products that are out there that we most were paying attention to are in Part 23 or the vertical lift category, which was not as fully opened up through the Pipistrel application. Think second was a bit of the dynamics in the market, so with the pandemic in 2020, I think a lot of milestones were dragged out a bit. 2021, money was easy, and I think that meant that money went to moonshots. So easy money doesn't mean it goes to practical, near term, near term wins. And so I think that a lot of the money that was being invested in late 2020 and throughout 2021 was going toward long horizon plays. So purposefully not aiming at super near term strategies. And I think that overfunded those, and we've seen many get significant funding, but then burning through it, and I think it underfunded the pragmatic strategies. and so what you saw was further pressures on or delays to the timelines for entry into service for those that might not have been as flashy, but were, were just making the, the next increment of meaningful progress. And then we've seen the retrenchment of the markets where now there's a bit of a recoil. I think, the industry's at risk of losing credibility. Given all the claims that were made and failed to be lived up to, whether that's certain timelines, or product performance, or cost metrics for the products. And so, I think the industry, in particular the capital allocators, may be licking their wounds from those moonshot projects that didn't play out, which doesn't help again those that are near term. What it does is it pulls back more capital away from everything, and so if you're looking at that as a lowering tide, each of these dynamics I think is has pressed away from certification milestones that we might have otherwise hoped to see more rapidly after the Pipistrel's early successes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what about the maturity of the enabling technologies themselves and the certifiability of the motors and batteries. What's the status there? And I was recently catching up with another founder and we started talking about this and it was surprising to hear how the regulatory bodies are trying to apply traditional propulsion system requirements to electric motors. So for instance, I think there's a requirement somewhere in internal combustion engines that they need to be able to run for, I think it's five minutes in max rated power, whereas an electric motor reaches its thermal limit, a lot quicker, maybe within, two minutes or so before needing to throttle back. And so that is one contentious issue, allegedly as is the example of having dual magnetos in ICE engines, and does that translate into, you know, double architecture in electric motors, all of that increasing mass, increasing budget, and really not making that cost equation as favorable as initially expected. Do you have any insights into those aspects of how the bottlenecks are being tackled at the certifiability and the maturity of the technologies?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think that this gets to one of the really critical and core risks in the industry, which is the supply chain and the ability to not just invent something, but to produce it reliably many times at a good economics. That's really what builds the markets here. I think the regulatory bodies are trying to adapt to what they know. And, those adaptations, whether it's the Part 23 rewrite, which adapted combustion type expectations to, an opener, larger net for what kind of technologies could actually be used to meet those requirements. But in the details, they're still looking for that familiarity. So what's your mean time between failure? How long can you run at full power? What are the failure modes and effects, and making sure that you're going through the detail on that? This is the, the specifics that you get into when putting together your program certification plan, your means of compliance, or ultimately going through the testing for your, Type Certificate or STC, and it is, it's really where the rubber hits the road in the industry. I don't think that all the answers are there yet. I think there are the early entrance, certainly Ampaire is, at least to our knowledge, the only company working on a hybrid electric propulsion system certification program actively with the FAA. And so this means that we are, we're clearing many of those open questions actively with them and collaboratively with them. It also means that we have, expectations upon our supply chain that, emerge over time if something, for example, with the FAA, brings up or highlights a requirement that we did not expect. As you talked about with the motors. for these questions about redundancy, there's what you could expect as a technologist, like you'd understand the technology and you believe this to be true, some level of safety, let's say, but that does not mean that will be accepted on the first pass through certification. And in fact, I think that the first paths through certification are going to be relatively risk averse and risk managed in those setting a higher bar for redundancy, not giving you credit for levels of safety that you think you might deserve. So, case in point, for the lithium ion batteries, no matter what you do to the cells, no matter how you package those cells into your modules, no matter what physical, interconnect or disconnect controls you have that might mitigate thermal runaway, or physical barriers that might mitigate propagation or software layers that are on top of all of that. The belts and suspenders and layers of safety. At the end of the day, the FAA, probably rightly so at this stage, requires you to show that you have physical barriers that if you force the battery into thermal runaway, the vehicle will be safe. So you don't get, you don't get actual credit for everything below that. You need ultimate safety and then all the other stuff that you thought was going to be sufficient. And these are, again, I don't think it should be surprising to anybody that the earliest, earliest applications, we're going to take a, the most risk managed approach. But what it means is that when you're a battery engineer on your fully electric vehicle, you're now doubling the weight of all these additional systems when you thought you could get there just with a really good BMS algorithm. And so what it drives is the decisions and it drives the, ultimately the designs into corners that might not be viable given some of those early assumptions. This is why we pushed again toward hybrid electric, because with a battery pack, a third the size of a Tesla pack and able to take on the extra weight and the payload hit along with it for all these physical layers of safety, we still have phenomenal performance on our system. and I think that these are, these are areas where the industry is trying to navigate alongside the regulations to mature, the solutions and the risk, together.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, what electric aircraft are selling in meaningful numbers today that you're impressed by?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you say stelling, I'm gonna assume you mean where there's a cash transaction and somebody ends up with an airplane. in their hangar at the end of it, and right now the only airplanes that are selling, are the Pipistrel aircraft at this time. There are many organizations placing orders, pre orders for, eventual deliveries, but at this stage, very minimal on the actual sales in this market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Kevin, what are you seeing as the FAA's thought process for how industry is going to incorporate improvements in hybrid electric propulsion systems into these aircraft in the coming years. These aircraft are long lived assets. Batteries still seem to be improving pretty markedly over the years. Motor technology as well. So if you certify something, on the one hand, you're locked in at that point in time, are they going to use an STC method for bringing improvements in? Or is there something that is even more fluid for allowing that, that they have in mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's a really good point because the technology base is moving so much faster than the time scale of a vehicle life, right? These aircraft last 40 years. And the, batteries are improving on the, on the order of every two to three years, you'd expect people wanting an upgrade of their battery pack to the next generation, a little bit like people might want their new iPhone every few years. The way you go about certifying your product matters. And if you wrap everything into the type certificate, then you need to amend or update the type certificate when anything changes. And so that would require a supplemental type certificate for certain types of changes. Generally, propulsion systems, propellers, or airframe changes require a new type certificate, or a amendment, or a STC, supplemental type certificate. There are things you can change on an airplane without having to go get an STC. You could replace a conforming part with an equivalent part. You're able to show certain equivalent levels of safety. And so there are efforts to try to find ways that these components which would be replaced over time, let's use the batteries as an example. Batteries degrade over the cycles of use, and every few years you want to replace those. You have to go get an STC for the new battery pack are you able to use a TSO type of process? Basically a lighter version of those approvals. And it really depends on exactly how that battery pack was incorporated into the vehicle level certification. So is it part of the engine? Is it part of the aircraft? Is it a safety of flight critical component? And then as technology improves, One of the things in aviation is you lock yourself into the parts that you designed and that an in any change in that part requires a change in your regulatory approval. So as batteries improve, how do you go through that certification pathway? Again, generally, what I think the industry will see is we guarantee equivalent performance while providing improved performance. And that all you're doing when you're meeting the existing regulatory waterline is you're saying we're at least as good as we were previously, and we haven't changed any flight characteristics. The question will be, when do you want to take credit for that? When do you want to allow the operator to plan a longer route? You can give them more energy, which gives them more safety, or maybe it gives them more flexibility on how many, how many flight miles they can perform or when they need to recharge at the other end. But it might not be part of the underlying. certification, performance capability of the vehicle that you've, that you've sought from the regulatory body. Now, this is a nuance, but it's the difference between having to go through the full cert program for the new tech or just increasing performance but taking credit for an equivalent level of safety. One specific point here, in our hybrid system, I have triplicate redundancy in our hybrids. We are phenomenally safe, and I believe safer than a traditional combustion engine would be, where it's a single point failure for the traditional engine. And in our, in Ampaire's system, we have redundancy, two layers of redundancy in the combustion engine. And then also this independent electric system, which is able to carry you further as well. But am I going to get credit for anything more than a single engine capability? Probably not. and that's understandable, at least initially. And I think over time, what people, what you'll get is additional credit for those things from the regulatory body. And in the interim, when new tech, motors, or batteries come out, It'll be at equivalent levels of safety as what was there previously.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What components of the hybrid electric propulsion system are changing the fastest right now, be it the battery systems, the motors themselves, power electronics, or something else? What do you see as the fastest changing or evolving?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, the fastest changing components historically have been those which had the benefit of riding the coattails of other industries. Aviation, as big as we love it and believe it is, is much smaller than, as a market driver, than other forms of ground transportation. And so we have been the recipients of rapid technology improvement across lithium ion batteries as energy density, volume density and cost get brought down. The, the motors have been a, truly the underlying enabling factor in many of these cases. So the power density of motors is pretty phenomenal compared to where it was a decade ago. And we still see companies that are, and we work closely with companies that are pioneering in this space. And you can start, you're getting great efficiencies and really high, power density out of these motors. Where, certainly Ampaire has locked most of the components for our launch product, but we have a flying testbed where we're able to bring in new technologies, where we first flew a silicon carbide inverter, when we have brought in new motors, inverters, and energy storage tech. And it's really in those, the motors and batteries that most people are pushing firmly for innovation, and then a bit in the efficiency of the power electronics, but a lot of that currently is, seems like it's lab scale technology. And while our work with ARPA E and NASA enables us to make that move even faster, I hesitate to, to think that lab technology today is going to rapidly enter commercialization anytime soon. I think we've seen a consistent trend that timelines for those developments take much longer than, than the, the technology teams would, would have originally anticipated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is aviation going to continue to benefit from advances in the automotive industry around the batteries that they use? Or is there going to be a fork in the road where the needs of aviation diverge from what the auto industry is pushing towards?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, the auto industry used to have range anxiety. But then battery energy density got to the point that you can drive hundreds of miles. There's a sufficient charging network. So I don't see the energy density being what automotive is optimizing for anymore. Really, I think automotive is going to continue optimizing for cost, and we've seen that over the last few years. Bringing the cost of an EV down is the driver for adoption more than bringing the range up. Whereas in aviation, we're still in that bringing the range up is the requirement. And so this is a divergence in the optimization goals for the technology coming out of automotive. Now the question would be, even if the goals are different, is the state of the art, the state of knowledge and capability, is that going to improve? As folks go toward lower cost, are we going to also see emergent benefits for aviation? Absolutely. As people do innovation and build new types of electric machines, it's no longer just about what is Tesla using in a Roadster, it's about where the larger vehicles, your mid duty and heavy duty trucks, what are the power requirements for those vehicles. What are the energy densities required for those? And so it's this expanding fringe of requirements that I think will also drive a, an alignment in, in, in emerging technologies with what aviation is looking for. But the core of a ground car is, is less likely to directly align with aviation than it did over the last decade in my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Are the batteries that you would design around for your hybrid electric conventional takeoff and landing airplane, are they the same ones that you would design around for a VTOL aircraft? And the reason I ask is that, an additional difference that I've, come to appreciate with batteries for VTOL aircraft is the power output demand on them, especially requiring high power output at the end of the flight as the aircraft transitions back into vertical flight to make its approach at the landing pad. That's a particularly, stringent requirement on the battery system. For what you're doing, I don't know, maybe that still exists. Maybe it's the same battery. Maybe you, you can, use the same tech, but how do you think about that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a nuance that most of the world, unlike you, Peter, most of the world doesn't catch the nuance between the different types of batteries. The power density versus the energy density needs to be tailored for the application. And what's interesting is you gave two examples. I'll add one more in there around fully electric airplanes. So let's take your eVTOL, which is fully electric, but requires huge amounts of power at a low state of charge at the end of flight, right? So you need a power cell there. Then you have a fully electric airplane, which has a large amount of batteries. And so actually a relatively low C rate, especially if it's conventional takeoff and landing. You're not really draining where, for those listening, the C rate is the rate of charge or discharge. as a proportion of the total pack size. And so that, when you have a really large pack, relative to your pack size, you're not discharging that rapidly. And so those can be energy cells, because you don't really need that high power C rate. But then you go to a hybrid electric plane. And as I mentioned, our pack is about a third the size of a Tesla pack. These are pretty small, actually. When you come through our hangar, you see this battery is big enough to fly a Caravan, really. And that is because in a hybrid, you use the battery differently than you would in the fully electric. A small battery pack, but you still have pretty high power for takeoff and climb. Again, now you need a higher C rate. You need more of a power cell. And so for each application, you do actually have different requirements for the type of the type of chemistry you might consider, the, tailoring of that cell between energy and power, certainly the life cycle economics of the pack, the degradation over time, you might have great power or great energy, but if you only cycle 400 times, then are you useful? There's a, there's, there are all these pieces that go into the details of selecting a battery. And this is the challenge that some companies who are trying to do a one size fits all, cell or module for everybody, need to hit the high waterline or miss the, miss the mark on their, their certain markets. And this is again, why I think it's so important to have a more flexible design where let's say that I need to increase the size of my pack a little bit because I'm not getting exactly what I wanted out of my supply chain, where we can handle that. it's not ideal. We don't desire it, but when you have a, an approach, which is just a little bit more flexible than, the pure heart requirement, I think most eVTOL folks. A lot of the ones who have decided to in house their battery development is because they realize they will not get precisely what they need from anyone else, and they have to tailor it directly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Given the advantages of the hybrid propulsion to electric, why would the eVTOL or the electric plane companies go purely electric versus hybrid? What would be some of their rationale?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Number one is, that I hear from them is on the emissions. They want to be able to say they can operate fully zero emissions. Number two is a statement around, around complexity, the economics of maintenance and that's a, it's an interesting argument which, without being deep into the weeds, it's hard to validate or, dispute. All the weeds that I've been in have shown that fully electric still has a way to go before it's economically more viable. But those are usually why I see, that it can, there are other ancillary features, like, for example, noise characteristics are important for communities. Oftentimes the reason communities get upset with aviation is because of the noise. And hybrid electric does not fully eliminate the noise profile, to the extent that full, that fully electric does. Fully electric planes, if you've ever flown in one, it's like being in a glider a lot of the time. It's really beautiful. and I think that some people have hung their hats on the sound, and frankly, to their credit, if you're an eVTOL talking about flying to the city center of Manhattan, you better be thinking about sound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's not how people are going to scale in the next several years. At the end of the day, regional air mobility most likely is how a vehicle is going to scale in the next, let's face it, 5 to 10 years. And given regional air mobility, given the requirements of the vehicles, I'm guessing that hybrid is going to be the, the limitations of hybrid are not nearly as impactful as they would be if they go into city center. And how many city center flights are going to be occurring in the next five to ten years, and especially at scale. So my guess is a lot of people right now listening are saying, hybrid's the way to go. Why would they not be saying that, especially as we start to talk about regional air mobility?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so it depends on who they are. Let's say that you are an eVTOL developer. We know many. And you've spent the last half a decade, investing how many hundreds of millions of dollars into your pure electric design. That is tailored, that every inch of it is optimized specifically for your fully electric operation. You don't have volume, you don't have weight, you would have to redesign your plane in order to integrate a hybrid electric system. And I know this because I've worked with those groups, and we have shown that you can apply a hybrid electric system in. But shoehorning a hybrid into a combustion plane is one thing, that's where we enter the market. Shoehorning a hybrid into something which was designed for a little battery pack, is a completely different beast. And I think a lot of these developers have gotten so deep into their fully electric application that they don't have the payload and volume capacity to take on the hybrid electric into their current designs. And so,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But let's move on. Let's say, Kevin, sorry, great answer, but let's talk about the operators who are going to be purchasing these vehicles. Why would they consider a fully, let's again, let's step into regional air mobility. Why would they consider a fully electric plane with its, with some of its limitations? Obviously some pluses, but the hybrid I would assume is still less noisy, for example, than a traditional combustion engine. Why would they consider a fully electric plane rather than a hybrid for regional air mobility in the next 5 to 10 years? What's their rationale? Put yourself in the position of an operator who has to make that decision.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so I would ask, what's the risk? Am I, what, truly, what's the risk? The risk that I put down an order? Even if it's binding, I'm sure there are tons of outs that if it, if this doesn't meet my performance requirements, I don't have to buy it. And probably if I'm putting money down, it's going into an escrow that it can come back to me. Most aren't putting money down for the fully electric, type orders that are out there. And so I would look at it and say, I could place an order for a fully electric plane and if it doesn't pan out, great. If all of the Swiss cheese of good things going right doesn't occur, I probably got a boost to my marketing and brand along the way, and I'm not out any money at the end of the day, I could probably still buy a hybrid down the road. Now, the reality is a lot of these groups are falling behind in our order books, so, potentially they won't be as, as, as early as they would like, but if magic happens and the performance is what people would love electric to be, then I get the electric plane and everything that I needed. And so I think it's a risk posture that, the benefit of placing a signaling order outweighs the risk. And the key for me, as Kevin and with my Ampaire hat on, is those folks still place orders for hybrids. Right? Like, when I talk to folks, they're like, Kevin, this is the first thing that I actually have confidence is going to come to market. I'm going to place an order for this. And what's silly is some of those people still say, and by the way, we don't want to talk publicly about this because our brand is still like fully zero emissions, but we know that this is probably going to come in first. And so we'd like to take part in it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, in what way is certifying a hybrid configuration easier or more difficult compared to certifying a battery electric?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the hybrid, one of the reasons it's easier is the safety case. The safety case for our system in the, condition where you assume you have an issue with the electric vehicle system, which is really what is the novel, parts of the technology. If you're in a hybrid electric condition like ours, you fall back onto a combustion engine and you fly home safely. We have full cruise capacity. With our combustion engine, so there's no degradation or risk to that operation if you shut off the electric system in flight. You can't say that for a fully electric, or hydrogen, for example, system that, when you have an issue, maybe you have redundancy in the battery packs, but the level of safety that you can, that you can, take credit for in the hybrid is quite a bit higher. And, and certifying that is, is we believe going to be faster and lower complexity and lower cost than going fully electric. The second is around the size and, requirements on each of the subcomponents. So whether it's the batteries or the motors, when you look at the reduced consequence of an issue, you can also, take different or take a different balance on the, the probability of certain issues occurring. And, and so the holistic risk analysis for the, the safety case, we have a little bit more flexibility. And that means that flexibility translates into the supply chain and our ability to move a bit more quickly and getting those, getting those technologies through the certification program.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the expected efficiency gain of a hybrid electric conventional aircraft versus the efficiency gain that we are seeing from hybrid electric automobiles? And is there a difference? And if so, why? And then we can get into efficiency gain that you would see from just like retrofitting an existing airplane versus designing an airplane around hybrid electric. Especially for the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft because going to electric propulsion when you want to do distributed electric propulsion for vertical flight or for electric STOL, okay, we get that, right? There's a capability there that's earning its way onto the aircraft. But if you are going for conventional takeoff and landing, and you are looking for an efficiency gain, what can we expect to see?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the efficiency of these hybrid systems, and I, I see hybrid as this gateway technology that as the underlying technology improves directionally toward fully electric, all of it will first get proven out in these hybrid electric systems, conditions. One of the, one of the great drivers for adoption of hybrid electric is the fuel efficiency of the systems that, that we and have already demonstrated and have been flying tens of thousands of miles so far in our hybrid systems and demonstrated a 50% fuel burn reduction. During takeoff and climb cycle, we're up closer to 70 percent fuel burn reduction. So these are actual measurements, right? This is not just an Excel spreadsheet model. This is empirical data and is the kind of benefit that you can get in certain embodiments of hybrid electric systems. So this is, pretty, pretty significant fuel savings, even when you're looking at the, the opportunity of hybrid-electric on the ground, where, call it maybe a 40 percent fuel savings, to 50 percent fuel savings on the ground. And it's all about the specific architecture of the system that drives the beneficial economics. Fuel is one of the largest, if not the largest, operating cost for most airlines. And so the fuel burn reduction then drives a positive cycle for the economic viability of new routes and market growth and higher frequencies of service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What phase of flight are these efficiencies realized the most?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, if you're just looking at a pure percentage basis of fuel savings, takeoff and climb is where you're getting the biggest boost from the electric system in our current architecture. There are lots of different hybrid architectures, and we've got a few of them, but what we're launching into product, into market with is a integrated parallel hybrid architecture where we use the electric system effectively as a boost during the high power phases of flight and the combustion engine as a baseline load of power for the cruise and, and across the rest of the flight. So you get up to 70 percent fuel savings, during that takeoff and climb cycle. And then it levels off toward about 50 percent fuel savings during the cruise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I see. What's the state of the art in some of the metrics on the battery side? We talked a little bit about, well, we didn't talk numbers, but gravimetric specific energy density, both at the cell and the pack level, the cycle life that state of the art batteries are achieving, and the, battery pack cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the, the batteries, so watt hours per kilogram is the metric that we in the industry normally uses to measure the energy density. The target most are aiming for is right around 400 watt hours per kilogram at a pack level. We're not close to that today. When you're looking at the packs today, you're at, right around 200 watt hours per kilogram really depends on your cooling system and where you draw the dotted line on the battery pack itself and what you include as weight versus don't include as kind of wet versus dry weight for the pack. The cells themselves, are, I remember a few years ago seeing cells that were cresting through the 200s of watt hours per kilogram, and then you get folks who are talking about 300, even into the 400 watt hour per kilogram cells. I think I've seen announcements about cells that are even significantly higher than that. Unfortunately, I'm not an expert in the kind of the lab type chemistry that goes into these batteries and the art of understanding where along the long tail of getting from lab into production you are and in measuring the number of years remaining is very challenging. And so it's hard to tell what, like, state of the art for, for the development of new technologies sounds like it's pretty far ahead in these high watt hours per kilogram. I think the reality is the first battery packs that get adopted into market are going to be at a pack level, maybe even sub 200 watt hours per kilogram, when you're looking full scope, full scope weight of the system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And in terms of cycle life and cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Cycle life and cost are, generally tailored depending on what your application are. So if you've got a more exotic cell, a higher power or energy density, it'll probably have a lower cycle life. I've heard some of our industry peers talking about cycle lives less than a thousand cycles. I don't see how that makes a whole lot of economic sense when you have to be replacing the batteries so, so repeatedly. We think that a 2, 000 to 3, 000 cycles, maybe it's 2, 000 full depth discharge, but you're looking at, you know, that might give you 4, 000 or 5, 000 actual flight cycles on a, on a vehicle, that's not unrealistic when you're not working with the most exotic type cells. And from a cost, I think, we're pretty conservative assuming costs are going to be pretty, pretty high, and it's hard to tell what'll come out in full production once you actually get to scale, but being at$500 per kilowatt hour, I think would be a great outcome for the industry if we were able to get there. And, I wouldn't be surprised if the very first battery packs that came to market were quite a, maybe a multiple higher than that. So maybe a thousand dollars per kilowatt hour. Which gets pretty expensive, especially when you're looking at the very large packs for, for the fully electric vehicles, but is still somewhat manageable with the, with the hybrid electric approach.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to put some business perspective into the conversation and if we use, uh, maybe we can get to ultimately the use case that you are pursuing at Ampaire, but one of the common near term use cases for electric aircraft is often thought of on the conventional side as a flight school trainer aircraft. Now, putting aside that the current range restrictions do not enable flight schools to use electric aircraft for the entirety of the curriculum for flight training, but for most, missions, it's good enough. What I'm interested in is when you actually go down into the weeds that you've been in, how the business case for an electric, fully battery powered aircraft pencils out when you consider the fact that, conventional piston engines are an industry that's been around for decades, benefiting from huge economies of scale, exceptional safety records, it's in the several thousands annual units, a lot of the development and R&amp; D costs have been recovered already. I mean, you're going after a relatively low cost. And I think the engine, replacement on, in this type application is in the 30, 40, 50. maybe 70, 000 per engine, correct me guys, uh, if I'm off. Uh, but at any rate, uh, you have that on the one hand, and then you have an electric, aircraft with a motor that, needs to recover the certification costs and development costs, and is one that every, you know, thousand cycles needs to replace the battery, which can be, I don't know, 80, 000 or whatever the cost is. So when you bake all of these different things, does it really become an attractive option?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So this gets back to your first question around what might the industry disagree with me on, and it is this principle that the economics must make sense in order for people to adopt the products. There are a lot of people out there who assume government subsidies will get us there, or people willing to pay a green premium. And while certain cases that might be true, to hit the scale of adoption that's required, you can't achieve it without really compelling economic benefits for the end user and buyer. So this example that you gave around the, the training, especially in these smaller airplanes, is a great one. The market makes so much sense. The direct operating cost seems so low when you're only taking into account the industrial power that you're using. It's cents on the dollar for OpEx. But when you look whole scale and you're comparing yourself against a, sub 100, 000 airplane with relatively low cost of capital, it's probably fully depreciated, and you're comparing that to a quarter million dollar new build plane that has these unknowns around the cost of batteries over time, or the cost of the infrastructure to charge. The economics are really called into question, especially before you get to full scale. And I think that's, rightly should be acknowledged as one of the big risks for adoption. The performance of the systems, especially in training, I think a blended fleet where, cross country flights might have to be in a hybrid or combustion, but fully electric can be done for the, a few touch and goes here or there, or just familiarization. That's, I think that's completely reasonable to solve the problem. But the economics, especially in smaller airplanes, are pretty challenging. When you look at the economics as you scale to larger planes, it similarly, anywhere that it's not an operator of, high frequency becomes challenging because to earn back the capital cost of the system, you really need high utilization. And, you're not generally going against an option which is a premium priced combustion versus a premium priced electric. It's probably a relatively low cost combustion versus a premium priced electric, and I think that will be a friction point for adoption for those types of applications.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, if you were to argue for a fully battery electric aircraft, what is the right initial use case that will generate this flywheel moment where it makes sense and it also is a good path to get to scale, which will have benefits down the road with economies of scale and the supply chain, et cetera, et cetera. What use case gets the industry going, if not flight training.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think the use case that gets the electrification industry going is using those technologies in full scale applications. So it's taking the exact same batteries, the motors, the power electronics, These certification bases, taking those and by applying them into the hybrid electric applications, you build the industry base. You build the production volumes. You solve those economic challenges tied in with the supply chain and the certification and the market's readiness to adopt. Tying in with the economics of the full scope view, you start to bring those costs down to a point where all of a sudden those same technologies, those same suppliers that are making batteries for the hybrid or making motors for the hybrid, when the economics of scale get to a point, those same suppliers will be the supply base for the fully electric applications where, the opportunities are vast for, where you might want to fly a fully electric plane, whether it's short hop island hopping for commercial cargo flights, commercial drones, or for eVTOL cargo, or for pilot training. There are a lot of areas where you might want the fully electric. And I think the way to get the industry to scale is by scaling the underlying components rather than scaling the end solution of fully electric. And that's when I talk about hybrid as this gateway technology, I truly believe I'm helping all the electric, maybe even helping some hydrogen out there. Like because we're maturing the industry, we're maturing the supply base and we're getting up to good economics, full scale marketability of these underlying technologies that ultimately can be packaged in the fully electric. And that's I think that's how you get there. In eight and a half years of every waking and sleeping moment thinking about it, this is the pathway that makes sense to me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We just had Rob Britton on a couple weeks ago, our last podcast, and he was talking about regional air mobility, and he was saying that it's conceivable that hybrid or electric aircraft will allow us to be able to get to locations that today are less profitable than using a purely combustion engine aircraft. Talk a little bit about that. I'm guessing that hybrid would be the only solution today, although he did mention, I believe, guys, a 30 passenger electric plane as a potential solution in the near future. But talk about the capabilities for hybrid electric for regional air mobility. What's the near term, long term solution from your perspective, Kevin?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I really enjoyed listening to the episode with Rob and his enthusiasm for regional hybrid electric. You can hear it coming through in the conversation. Love it. And the folks over at Heart who you mentioned a few times, you know doing some really interesting work in trying to open up the regional space. Also in that episode, he had mentioned that this regional space is kind of eroded over the years. I mean, with deregulation and things having to compete just on the economics, economics really didn't make sense to serve a lot of secondary or tertiary markets. And so the service to those markets has gone away. And, that demand still exists, it's just being served by ground transportation, people jumping in their cars instead of flying. If you were able to give an economic alternative, lower cost of operation, being the key adoption driver, then people would potentially choose to fly those routes instead of drive those routes. And I think he was spot on with that and the enthusiasm around regional air mobility. Two areas that I would disagree with the approach, though. One is there's a phenomenal difference between a 19 passenger plane and a 20 passenger plane. While it might look almost the same, it is categorically different, in the literal sense of it, is a different category of airplane between Part 23 and Part 33. And the idea that somebody will open up regional air mobility with a Part 25 plane that is something over 20 passengers, I think, is faulty logic there. I don't think it's going to be, Part 25 is not going to be ready for hybrid electric, fully electric, any novel system for quite some time. Now, I want it to be there, and we're certainly helping the industry get there, and there are companies betting their, livelihood on it, but this is where I would disagree with the approach because we believe Part 23 is where it has to start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, explain for the audience the nuances of the differences.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So there are two major categories for conventional airplanes. One category, which is under Part 23 of the regulations, governs all planes up to 19 passengers or the equivalent weight. Part 25 governs all airplanes, 20 passengers and above. And so when regulations are updated in the industry, they're updated for one category or the other, eventually both. The smaller aircraft category, Part 23, is already positioned with all of the legislation and regulation in place to adopt novel propulsion technologies. The larger category is not in that state yet. It takes a decade of work to make a significant change to regulation in aviation. And I think we have years ahead of us before the large aircraft is ready to adopt novel propulsion technology from a regulatory standpoint. The technology might be there, but I think the regulations are going to lag in that case. So entering market with Part 23, or airplanes that are up to 19 passengers, I think is the fastest way, and frankly the only way we will see commercial adoption this decade. And that maybe in the next decade we'll see, through the proof points of these Part 23 smaller airplanes, we will see that technology leapfrog up into and enable the conversion of those certifications requirements in the larger Part 25 airplanes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Speaking of regional air mobility, wanted to get your thoughts on whether you think that electric aviation is what catalyzes regional air travel, or is there a, simply a thickness of the demand that's an issue that needs to be addressed somehow first. You know, we can take a brief look at history prior to the 1978 deregulation, point to point was the, airline network model, and regional travel was subsidized by the government mostly. Post deregulation, we saw the emergence of hub and spoke and a lot of regional routes were abandoned because they did not make economic sense anymore. So you can look at that to draw the conclusion that, well, actually the demand is there is just a matter of making that air travel economic. And so, that's an argument for the technology's role in disrupting, again, this, segment of the industry. If that's the case, well, first of all, do you think that's the case? And then second of all, do you think that electric aviation is the technology that will make economics appealing or you need to start layering additional things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I absolutely think, electrification is the pathway to making the economics make sense. And the improved economics drives this elasticity, this growth in the market. where we will see increased frequencies on the existing routes, decreased ticket costs as competition goes up on those, and increased accessibility or flights to fringe airports, either in a hub and spoke extension or a point to point model that, that allows more people to have access to air travel. I think adoption will also be driven by in similar economic driver but through cargo. I think the cargo market will be a rapid adopter of good economics and will be serving maybe even before the passengers choose to fly to these areas. Same day and next day delivery of packages is a growing expectation for our global economy and I think that what we'll see is as the economics improve the cargo operators, so, think your, your FedEx's, UPS's, DHL's, and similar around the world are going to be adopting these both to serve the high end communities who, want their Amazon packages in the next day, but also to open up these billion people markets that don't currently have access to the global economy efficiently, whether that's moving agricultural goods or other products, the economic drivers of increasing accessibility for them. So it's not just about U. S. states and cities. I do actually think on the global scale, these economics open up countries, entire regions of the world that are currently isolated from the global aviation ecosystem and economy. And when you look at that as a driver for scale, it's not about you know, 10 percent increase in the people who want to fly to Fresno. It's about a going from a market of zero to a market of again, hundreds of millions of people being served for the first time ever and what that drives. And so I wholeheartedly think that the economics of electrification is what gets us there. It is also on those principles that I think some of the exciting features aren't necessary to get us there. So vertical takeoff and landing, important in some areas, but probably not important for the vast majority. Fully electric and important and beneficial, but not useful if you can't land on that dirt strip in Kenya. Like, you have to have full flexibility, and this is part of the reason why I have such conviction around the regional air mobility being opened up through hybridization, where we don't have any of those infrastructure, range or operational limitations, but give that great economic benefit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Kevin, let's say we had a Part 23 aircraft and we wanted to be able to get more aircraft to cities that are not being well served today. And you're saying Part 23 was the way we'd have to do it today. What's the cost per available seat mile for a conventional aircraft, hybrid and electric? Assuming the three of them, could meet that capability today, what's the relative cost difference between the three?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the difference in CASM between conventional and hybrid, we're looking at really depends on, on exactly how you're operating the plane, right? So it's going to be a range. We're looking at a 20 to 40% savings on your cost per available seat mile. So think, again, depends on how you're flying the plane, going from a dollar per available seat mile down to, 70 cents or there's 60 some odd cents per available seat mile. that kind of a transition in certain cases. Electric's harder because right now when I run the numbers, depends on how you assume battery costs, because batteries are the big replacement cost there, but the, right now it does not in my mind, close economically to go fully electric. Also, it's hard to do the analysis because most of the routes you can't even operate. And then the question comes in on, do I count the grid infrastructure upgrade costs and capex and costs of that capital over time in the analysis, or do I not? So it gets a bit muddy. I don't have numbers specifically on the electric in isolation, for those reasons.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you talked to airlines, who today say those routes are not profitable because of the traditional aircraft? Have you talked to them about your operating costs? Are they saying, if you can get me a 30 to 35 percent reduction, that's a route that becomes profitable?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Yeah, the numbers I just talked about are from a very specific model with a very specific airline that I can't mention the names of, but yes, we get into the weeds with our customers and look at their actual operations, their actual frequencies, and how they actually fly the planes. And look at holistic costs, because it's not just about how many miles or hours you fly, it's about pilot costs, it's about outstation staffing, it's about infrastructure upgrades, and if you're serious about this, you need to look holistically at every, down to what is the interest rate on the loan that you take out in order to, or the financing that you get in order to buy the system in the first place. Like there are, all the holistic view on the economics, and making sure that is, economically positive for our customers is how we get through it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I really want to underline the holistic approach because I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. There's a lot of enthusiasm about quoting direct operating cost reductions with electrification, but if you look at it in the context of regional air mobility, where you're really competing with cars and rail and when you are accepting the fact that electric motors are not in their prime time to address this need today, and you start talking about, okay, well, what really do customers care about other than price? They care about frequency and the reliability of the schedule. And that means that you have to be able to, honor a, a service that will be available in all kinds of weather or most weather. So now you start talking about IFR capability and now you start introducing IFR reserves on top of an already small range budget. And it's only when you look at things holistically like that, do you really get a clear perspective on, okay, how really competitive is electric aviation in this particular use case today or over the next couple of years. And I think that, you know, there needs to be a little bit more realism.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I agree, because I think that realism is going to be what builds credibility. It's what enables adoption, it's what enables all of these other factors, many of which we haven't even touched on, whether it's the insurance companies or the lessors, we have to worry about residual values. the holistic view is the only way you actually get a full ecosystem to buy in. And, I just recently had a deep dive with one of our major customers, on IFR, speed, and Flight into Known Icing conditions, because these are the realities of their operation. And we need to know, hey, if we choose to fly five knots faster or five knots slower, what are the repercussions? If we are, like, flying, like, guaranteeing IFR, or if we are, if, what happens if you're not flight into known icing conditions? You're hardly useful, because it's not just Alaska where you have to deal with icing, right? It's everywhere that you have to be confident in your aircraft's ability to operate. Otherwise these mission critical operations have to ground the plane. And if you ground a plane in one of these operations, it destroys a whole network. It has a residual ripple effect through the operations, until recovered. So, so it's important to have these capabilities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So here's a thought, Kevin. What if after all is said and done, the, 30, 40, 50 percent improvement really becomes something more like 10 percent? I'm talking hypothetically here, right? At what point does it make more sense to incrementally improve the efficiency of a turboprop or a conventional aircraft that is certified, well known, all of those things, and perhaps kickstart the electrification supply chain on the unmanned side of things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It makes a lot of sense to, to find wherever you can build the efficiencies into the operation. from the airframe design, there's some folks out there who, with traditional engines, are looking at cutting 30 to 50 percent of the fuel burn out of your 7 37 class planes by bringing, blended wing body type airplanes to market. So there, there are ways that you can, by creating a new aircraft, even if you're not changing propulsion, you can get some meaningful efficiency gains as well. At the end of the day, when you achieve fewer economic benefits, it reduces the addressable market for the technology. So, or inverting that, for every percent cost that I save, it opens up more and more market opportunities. So, there's a old story in the industry about a major airline that removed a few pages from their in flight brochure to save a few pounds because that mattered, right? And these are fractions of a percent saving. So in your example of saving 10%, still transformative. For many operations. Now, is it going to be as transformative as saving 40? Nowhere close. Will it still be meaningful? Only if it's economically compelling. And so this is where you look at the conversion. You know, so maybe somebody struggles to retrofit their plane, but if you're buying a brand new plane and you get to choose between, CapEx neutral across the two, the combustion or a hybrid, and that hybrid saves 10 percent on your OpEx, you might still go with the hybrid system because economically that still makes sense. So this could be a factor that delays adoption if the economics don't work out. From an unmanned standpoint, we're already seeing from a drones, eVTOL, or like a Department of Defense type applications some fully electric, uh, or places where the economics don't matter as much, where you know, they're willing to pay a premium for the mission capability. Those are certainly additional early adopter areas where I think, the industry is likely to get a boost, regardless of the fuel savings, a boost in market applicability because of the performance characteristics of these new vehicle types.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is the drone propulsion supply chain overlapping into the propulsion supply chain that you deal with?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, a year and a half ago, we acquired a company's assets, called, the company was named Talyn and Talyn was developing a, effectively a cargo lift drone, and various types of payloads that it could carry. Our propulsion systems fit straight into that cargo drone, straight into traditional, conventional takeoff and landing drones, or eVTOL, for a whole variety of applications. Ampaire's focus is, again, the disagreement place number one. Propulsion is where you begin, and I want to put propulsion across everything. And, yeah, so the same engine types, I mean, there are flavors and variations of engines, but, the major families are applicable across. across the industry, whether it's manned or unmanned.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, tell us a little bit about Ampaire. How do you make money today? How do you make money in five years and 10 years? What's your special sweet spot?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Ampaire is focused on the electrification of aviation, focused on propulsion, specifically hybrid electric propulsion, upgrading existing aircraft types as an entry point into market and using that as a gateway to transition the industry toward lower carbon and better economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Give examples of the type of aircraft that you're converting. I saw a Skymaster as\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>so back in 2019, we flew our very first aircraft type, which is a upgraded Cessna Skymaster push pull configuration. We call that an independent parallel hybrid architecture, where you have one combustion engine, one fully electric. We've also flown the Cessna Grand Caravan, which is with an integrated parallel hybrid architecture that uses a, mechanically coupled electric and combustion set of engines to be a hybrid electric aircraft. That same engine that goes into the Caravan is what we just finished our CDR on the King Air for integrating there. We've got the Twin Otter is a 19 passenger plane in the same category. And there are thousands of planes in market that use this category of engine. So this is our half megawatt class system. We also have a quarter megawatt class system, which is used as a, either a genset or propulsion system for general aviation, drones, and eVTOLs. Now, as a company where we're focused is around the certification of that launch product and the Caravan. The market that adopts that is both passenger carrying and cargo carrying for the commercial industry, but then also we've got a number of contracts with the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Energy. So our money today, our revenue, which is really just offsetting NRE costs, or non recurring engineering costs. We've brought in about 25 million of government contracts. For these, through these government customers, for the development of our propulsion system and the application of that system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're making$500 million in 5 years, who are your primary customers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we scale commercial revenue, this comes from the regional aviation market. These are folks who are currently buying turboprop engines and would instead of overhauling their engine or buying a new engine, would be buying one of Ampaire's hybrid electric amp drives. These amp drives are the ones which save 50 percent fuel burn, and we believe will save on maintenance cost as well. So it'll be good economics for people to switch over to our systems rather than run on their traditional combustion system, and this is where we see the earliest adoption for technology. So begins as retrofits of the existing fleet of turboprops, but then quickly moves into partnering with OEMs, the aircraft manufacturers, for when they build a new airplane, giving it a hybrid option. The next phase is, of course, working on clean sheet design planes with OEMs who are optimizing planes, new designs, around the novel propulsion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Tell us a little bit about your, you have a great history of being an innovator and entrepreneur. Give us some lessons learned to our innovators who are listening today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, it's been eight and a half years at Ampaire. The number one and biggest recommendation I can give is choose something that you deeply love and that you think you can actually achieve. The days get challenging over the course of years as an entrepreneur. It is not easy. It is oftentimes not even fun. But when you know that you're doing the right thing, when you're tackling the most meaningful, challenging, visible problems that you possibly can, it gives the motivation, not just for you as an individual innovator, but truly, these are things done by teams. And when you have meaningful work, and you're thoughtful about it, it enables you to pull together teams of really great people to go do these audacious things. I think the importance of setting tangible and tractable goals that you can actually achieve in the near term is very important. It's not just about moonshots, it's about the steps on how to get there. And, and ultimately, it's about building long standing relationships and not looking for what do I get now or, being short sighted in them, because truly the world is built by people and, and supported by relationships that are built over years or decades. And so, being a good actor in the industry is so important.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, you've acquired companies, you were almost acquired yourself. What advice would you have for people who might be going through a similar process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so always be open to opportunity and thoughtfully assess it. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the opportunity to go public via SPAC was pretty exciting, and there was a whole lot of money on the table, both from company valuations and from operating budgets. But you also have to be willing to change course when it's clear that the course you're on is not the right one, which we did in early 2022. Ampaire pulled out of a deal to go public because we realized that it was, the higher risk path and it was not worth, continuing down that path of going public and getting acquired. These are hard decisions that you need clarity, you need good advisors and mentors to support you on, and ultimately you need to set the ego aside a lot of times and go on good first principles when making your decisions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, thanks a lot.

Welcome to The Vertical Space for a discussion with Declan Ryan, one of the co-founders of Ryanair and a serial builder of low cost airlines. With commercial drone operations, starting to gain momentum and the contours of future eVTOL operations becoming better. Understood. It's important to highlight the evolution of the low cost airline business model and learn the lessons from this market. And we have just the right guests to take a deep dive into this fascinating topic. Dec takes us to the early days of Ryanair, how they viewed the market opportunity initially. How they chose to compete with legacy airlines. The strategic choices, early pivots all the mistakes along the way. And some very funny moments including negotiating a potential acquisition with British airways. More broadly though, with discuss how low cost airlines make money in a highly commoditized environment, the revenue opportunities, ways to remove costs from operations and the role of technology in this relentless pursuit of operational excellence. Dec has been in the industry for a long time. And what you'll hear from him is a sober, unfiltered view of the challenges and opportunities that the airline industry is facing both today and in the near future. Throughout the conversation we make references to AAM and the ways in which the lessons learned in the low cost airline business might inform eVTOL operations and drone operations at scale. There are many lessons that the advanced air mobility industry should embrace, mistakes it should not repeat. And Dec highlights those, backing them up with personal experience, starting, running, or being involved. With a number of airlines around the world. We discussed many other topics, such as decarbonizing aviation, supersonic air travel, how startups should pitch airline customers. Advice to entrepreneurs and much more. Declan is the founder and managing partner, Irelandia aviation, which has built five low cost carriers to date, including Ryanair Allegiant, Tigerair. Viva Aerobus in Mexico, Viva Air in Colombia, and Peru. As mentioned he is a co-founder of Ryan air, where he also served the CEO. Former Avianca board member and a former executive chairman of Viva Air. Declan is also the founder of The One Foundation, a major Irish philanthropic organization. He invested and advised a number of technology startups with a strong focus on travel and aviation. Thank you for being on The Vertical Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Welcome to The Vertical Space. Declan. It's a real treat to have you on the show.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thanks Luka. appreciate it. And it's nice getting involved in the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would dare to say that almost everyone our audience has heard of Ryanair, but not all are aware of the impact that it's had on the airline industry. So today we get to unpack the story behind the founding of Ryanair the low cost carrier model in general what it took to disrupt the legacy status quo and importantly, what lessons should. Drone operators take from low cost carrier operators, so lots to unpack today. But as usual, let's start with the 1st question is there anything that very few in the industry agree\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>with you on? I would say very few. We take a view that, fares should be free, zero and make the revenue by adding on. So that's our cost position. So if you do that, you just keep focusing on costs and what happens, I think with carriers is they get good years for revenue and they forget about the cost certainly the legacy guys do that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, I got to follow up on that. So Dec that's wow. That's innovative. So you're saying don't charge for the seat, correct me where I'm wrong, but charge for the other ancillaries first of all, have you ever done it and peel it back a bit, just talk a little bit more about it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We haven't ever done it because I don't think we've got the cost to the level we want to. I'm talking about Ryanair, but we were involved with other ULCCs around the world, which I'll talk about in a minute. So we've never got to the position that we would do it. But kind of interestingly, when we do free fares or, you know,$1 fares we make about 16 euros out of it. So, you know, that's people doing add ons. So I think if the fares were cheaper then you get more of the add ons and people feel like spending because they haven't been raped on the high cost of some of air fares.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And you're not talking about, charging for walking on the plane, putting something under the seat, putting something in the overhead. You're talking about ancillaries like credit cards and the like, where the airlines are going to make the money. Can you just talk a little bit more about how the airline would make money if they're not charging for the seat?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the auxiliary revenue can be very high people pay for insurance they pay for onboard service. They're in our app, do holidays. There's just loads of different options for charging. Irelandia is a low cost operator, so that's why we think low cost. It's kind of philosophy that you try to get the fare as low as possible and then add on the auxiliaries and most people will add it on and, as you know, guys yourself I don't think travel agents and particularly travel operators have much of a future because I think most of us now booked to different sectors, the car hire, the hotel. And so we, we were shareholders in a great airline and I don't know what the numbers are now, but, Allegiant used to sell like 60, 70, thosand hotel beds in a month when we were there and that's, that's colossal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so, Dec, what do you hear in terms of feedback from the customers? What do the customers? Want when you compare against offering such a low fare with, generating revenues through the add ons, versus addressing a degree of certainty to the customer in terms of what the trip is ultimately going to cost them. What are customers saying on that topic and how do you address it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I know this is going to sound funny, but I think they lie. And the reason I make that point is we used to do loads of surveys with all the airlines were involved with six in total. And we used to ask them you know, what's the reason they're flying with Viva Columbia or Ryanair or whoever. And price always came in fifth. Which I just used to laugh at because we know the reason they're flying with us. It's because we're low costs and the fares are low, but you know, the consumer doesn't want to admit that they go to Walmart or fly Ryanair or fly Frontier and so on. So it's kind of a quirky thing and some areas, Peter it's regarded as cool and that's more the younger generation who are being smart with their costs and so on. There's a joke around the low cost airlines that, if your girlfriend's in Paris and the fare is 30 euros and you say you can't make it, the relationship's in a lot of trouble.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned costs. So at the end of the day, you're still making money on all the different ancillaries. But what your major message is, you got to keep the cost down. Yeah, you just kind of break down. You've done so much with somebody different airlines, including Give a perspective on the airline cost Dec A lot of our listeners generally err towards advanced air mobility and clearly there's a lot of airline leaders listening in. But this is a market that they generally are selling into. And these are really important customers, give them a sense for how you view costs, how your airlines view costs that not everybody would otherwise understand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm actually not going to give you a Ryanair example. I'm going to give you an Indigo in India example, which is one of my favorites. They decided not to use curtains on board and their view was it was too costly and it was also too costly to clean and they worked out. It was something like two grand a month per airplane to maintain curtains and they decided not to do it. So that's the philosophy. Some people don't like it. I think it has to happen in the eVTOL industry. We in Irelandia and we're looking at Europe on this is, and we, we wanna be the number one provider in Europe. The way we look at, at it is. take cargo as an example, do you really have to land at the airport? Can you go from a cargo hub, for example, to a relatively close place at the airport? I don't mean another transfer, but, you know, don't always focus on airport real estate because it's expensive and maybe dublin, the Belfast maybe it doesn't have to actually go from airports\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To what extent is the airline business commoditized today and in what ways can airlines still differentiate themselves and build some long term defensibility,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Differentiate themselves from who Luka from other competitors. It is commoditized. You know, when you think about it an airfare with Ryan air or any of the for 30 bucks or whatever the price is as it's low, that is a commodity. And that's been seen around the world. I think the way. ULCCs differentiate themselves is just be different than the legacy guys. And that's very easy to do. you know, Delta can't move quickly or United can't move quickly. they're a bit of a Mike Tyson, make sure you don't get punched in the nose, but dance around them. We can do stuff on social media that they probably can't and, that kind of stuff helps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I'm sure we'll come back to some of these in more detail, but let's rewind to the founding of Ryanair. So tell us a story of how that came about and, as you tell the story highlight, what signals you have picked up in the industry that convinced you that there was an opportunity that not many identified before, but certainly not in, in Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, Luka at the start with, we got all our strategy wrong at the beginning we tried to be a me too, to the legacy guys, and we were never going to win then we looked at the Southwest model and said, that's for us. What transformed the airline was an order with Boeing. We were operating back one 11 aircraft. That's what transformed the business. We never thought it was going to be the size that it was today. You know, anybody says that to you, they're lying. And today, for example the CASM, the cost per seat mile on Ryan air is probably 50 percent of what it is on Southwest and today Luka, I don't regard Southwest as a low cost carrier. I admire them greatly, but what they do effectively is say, I'll be 20 percent less than Delta or 30 percent less than United. We had several people who wanted to buy us, including British Airways and Aer Lingus. I was for selling because. The first 10 years of Ryanair were a shit show. It was very very difficult cash operations and,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>sorry to interrupt you, but, given that we like details give us a little bit more, take us back to those, you know, 80s. Who were the main protagonists? What was the conversation around the table?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Luka, a little bit more detail. We used to have Saturday morning meetings at 8. 30 with my pop down in Tipperary and myself and Michael the guy behind the success in Ryanair, Michael O'Leary. We used to travel down every Saturday morning. We were shitting ourselves because we were always asking for cash. And we took turns about who would arrive in first, because you were being growled at by Tony about cash and I went in, I took the hit and I agreed that I would come in 1st the drive from Dublin used to be about 3 hours. So I would effectively come in 1st on this particular day and Michael would be, you know, 2 or 3 minutes behind me. But anyway, my pop had built at the back of the farm where his office was, he had built a well, area kind of look like something religious. It looked like an area where water would be and you would walk by us and so on. And I was making sure I didn't use the word cash in my first sentence. Because I would be eating and I said, what's the well for and he said, you bastards will need it because you're going to need holy water when you come down here. That set the tone. Tony and Michael were brilliant. They had different ideas, but they were brilliant. And. You know, putting in Michael as CEO was a great idea. It was something I was pushing with Tony for a long time. I was CEO for a while and I loved it, but I think I was in my early 20s. I was in my early 20s and I was at an engineer's meeting one night and we. We're making sure that they got the message about the spare parts and all that stuff and the engineering for the year. And I said, listen, we're not going to, order APU's for$200 000 or whatever. And there was a guy at the back who said, why do you take it out of your communion money? He was being sarky, but that's when I realized. Run the airline, the guys think I had cash in my bank account at home, which I didn't we were offered, I remember at one stage Erlingus wanted to buy us and they offered 23 million pounds. We have pounds at the stage and Tony asked us when we went another Saturday morning, he said, what did we put into it? And we said 29 million and he said, well, the price is 29 million. So the deal fell away, but Jesus, I was in tears. I would have sold it in the morning, but you know, I think anybody would think that Ryanair would be worth 10 billion or whatever the market cap is today. Just didn't realize what the success would be.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you said initially that you tried to mimic the strategy of others, I assume Southwest to a certain extent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, no, no. I didn't be the legacy guys in Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What specific insights prompted a pivot? And at some point you mentioned that it was the aircraft that transformed the business. Tell us more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. Well, you know Aer Lingus has been around for a long time and so has BA. So if we were trying to offer you a croissant or we were trying to, you know, go to the business market, we'd be kind of third on the list. I think most of our business carriers, customers and all the ULCCs are small businesses or entrepreneurs. They will come to Ryanair, but the guys who have an account with Diageo or Unilever or McKinsey would fly with the big boys. So we were losing that business traffic. We had originally bought a 737 200 via Boeing. When we got the 800s. The fuel burn was effectively the same as the 200s and we had another 50 passengers that is just incredible. And we obviously got a very good deal out of Boeing because one thing Boeing does very well is if they believe you, they'll make pricing possible. You've seen that with Southwest and other Boeing carriers. So that really transformed us. And I always remember the numbers and fuel you know, effectively carrying another 50 or 60 passengers and the fuel burn being the same. And also what happens guys is you order new airplanes and everybody takes you more seriously.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dec, the one thing that I remember Mr. Kelleher from Southwest when he was opening up. Long Island I told him that I was from Rhode Island, a Providence area. And he said, yeah, nobody ever thought the Providence would work because, they felt that there just wasn't enough market. But he said, I went in there with my lower prices and I uncovered markets that nobody ever thought were possible. So were your lower costs, were you able to uncover demand that was not otherwise there from the two big guys?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, well, first of all let's talk about Herb for a sec. I met him a couple of times. I actually stayed up too late within one night gambling, and I lost all the money. But there was a couple of us. He was still drinking whiskey at whatever hour in the morning. And I was just amazed at this. kind of regarded him as a bit of a Walt Disney with regard to his mind and his aspirations and so on. At one stage, and it was a long time ago. The biggest route on Ryanair was between Bournemouth and Han, I don't care if you went to Harvard or Stanford, you wouldn't have guessed the a small airport in south of England and an airfield over in outside of Frankfurt would be our number 1 route. So, the beauty of ULCCs is you can try something and, if people aren't traveling at 30 or 40 dollars. you don't need a McKinsey's to do a market survey. effectively that is your survey and people won't travel there, but you know, we can do routes that people never would imagine happening. You see it a lot in the U S some of these new regional airports that the likes of frontier and yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So you can try them. And after six months, if it doesn't work, you have the answer, but Herb was God.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dec, let's stay back in the early days and you start early operations. You receive the larger aircraft share some additional stories and insights from operations that then informed your strategy going forward and ultimately, I'm intrigued by your comment that. You don't really regard Southwest as a low cost carrier, but most people would associate Southwest as the pioneer of the low cost carrier model. So give us a little bit more background in terms of the business model evolution informed by the early days of your operation and how that compared to the Southwest model.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You know, the U. S. guys is a very expensive area to operate into and you know, your airports are expensive pilots are bloody expensive in the U. S. They're expensive everywhere. But, I'm always surprised about the cost in the U S you would think it's cheaper than it actually is. And maybe that's for a conversation for another day. I think one of the things Luka that transformed Ryanair on our course was what we did with the pilots. If you wanted to play golf for the summer, we had base salaries, and then you got a a payment per flight. And that's still there today. If you wanted to work your off, you could earn, I don't know at the time, a hundred. 110, 000 euros, and you'd be flying, up to 800 hours a year if you wanted to play golf for the summer or do something with the family effectively you had your base salary and you didn't have your instruments for flying. You know, I really worry about the industry today. Luka, when you hear United and American, paying up to half a million dollars for a pilot for a captain. I'll give you an example. We had our own Tiger Airways in Singapore, which was a very successful JV with SIA and SIA cleverly didn't take majority control of the airline. They had 40%. And the primary reason they did that Luka was to say to the pilots and the engineers from. The legacy was, we don't control this and the salaries are different. And so anyway we got Changi to build a budget terminal. And I think the figure was 22 million for the terminal. And, when you look at that, that was very cheap and they did it within a year, which was amazing. It's typical Singaporeans anyway, at the launch stage. There's all the dignitaries and stuff there. And I said, screw that. I'm, I'm going to head up with one of the airport ladies was showing us the way around for the tour. And was asking her about, they called it the budget terminal, you know, what a shitty name. But anyway so I said to her where's the coffee shop. And she said budget passengers don't drink coffee and I just roared laughing, so you have this concept. The other Tiger story was we had an airplane AOG SIA ring us up and said, when are you leasing in a new airplane? And we said, listen, would you go jump yourself? Because we're not going to lease in a new airplane for at least a couple of days. The SIA model is all customer and they would have a backup for an airplane straight away. So we just told them, you know, We stopped taking calls from HQ.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So based on your experience at Ryanair, and you said you'd do a lot different, including not go head to head with the two big guys. What are a couple of things that you would do different that you would want our audience to hear that, you know, don't make these mistakes. And here's what we would do different at Ryanair from the early days.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, think by the way, there was a bucket load of mistakes that we made. And when you look back at Ryanair, the transformation was the aircraft order, and we were never going to get our CASM right until we did that original order with Boeing. We should have done that earlier. And we kept going around saying we can't afford Boeing aircraft and that that was actually wrong. And, you know, Luton Airport. Some people love it. Some people hate it. It's ironically Luka, the demographically the best airport in the UK, because so many people live around Luton. We tried to get American Airlines to buy it, and they looked at it very seriously. But the perception of Luton was, it was kind of like an ice hockey game with everybody thrown beer. It just wasn't taken seriously and so on. We moved the Stansted when it opened up and, I'm not too sure we didn't, tackle the issues on Luton quickly enough. And part of that, by the way, was connections into the city because everybody was going into London. So it's a bit like flying to New York with all the different airports, but you're still trying to go into, the city we want to race against all the carriers. There was a race from Dublin to, let's say, St. Paul's cathedral or something like that in London. And we won the race, but the only reason we won the race is we use the motorbike and not a car for the passenger, but we didn't tell anybody that. Which was kind of funny, but we wouldn't have won the race with needed a car, you know,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>22:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>what kind of pushback did Ryan air get from legacy carriers, both at the beginning of operations? And then later, as it started to gain market share.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, a couple of things in Ireland at the time, Aerlingus, this was owned by the government. So we used to say when we met the minister for transport. It was like a boxing match and the referee owned one of the boxers. So, there was this deep belief in Aer Lingus and the government. We weren't going to succeed. And secondly we weren't safe. And there was all these barriers out there and the airport operator in Dublin, you have to remember how cozy these things are. And in those days, some of the women in Aer Lingus had married some of the guys in the airport, and then vice versa. And there was just this ongoing perception, and, Aer Lingus was a very powerful Brand and they're very good at fighting sometimes below the waist, but effectively we just try to do all the David and Goliath stuff and, and be seen as the cheeky startup. But, you know, there was always a question mark in people's mind with Ryanair survive and so on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what ultimately made Ryanair successful? Despite all odds, what are some of the strategies or technologies or processes or partnerships competencies? What key resources were necessary to profitably execute on the Ryanair idea?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think the internet transformed everything for low cost carriers. And if you remember in the old days, you're probably too young, Luka, but the, travel agent commission was around 9%. And sometimes we knew that the Aer Lingus was paying, you know, a little bit above that and then the internet came along and our effective distribution costs went down to around 2%. So that transformed the airline. That's a very good example for the airline. And then when we took away the connection between the fare and the auxiliary, and in particular bags that also transformed the airline and, people weren't focused on how many bags they were carrying. And I have this ongoing issue with my partner, we go away for a weekend and her bag is, 25 kilos and, you know the average stay used to be in Ryanair for somebody was about two and a half days for all the trips that they made around Europe. Most men will tell you, you can do that in a rucksack and a carry on bag. Most women will tell, you know, and they pack also for the kids. So, that was a strategy that was very careful and we'll thought out with regard to the disconnection between the fair and the other stuff and, you know, baggage was huge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>25:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And this was pioneered by Ryanair.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>25:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Not sure. Think we were the pioneers in Europe. And I think Ryanair as an example, and I would use some of the U S carriers. They think about costs all the day. I don't think Southwest. Think about calls all the day, by the way, I'm not trying to urinate on Southwest I think they're fantastic, but, I think if Herb was around, they would do things differently when it comes to cost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the things Dec and still staying on Ryanair because it's so interesting around the same time I believe People Express started and there's kind of a classic case that People Express was if they had just stuck to their knitting, they would have probably been fine. One of the things they, did which caused harm is that they started encroaching on the routes of the bigger airlines like American. Yeah. It sounds like you didn't do that. You may have made a lot of mistakes. But it sounds like to Luka's question of, you know, what did you do well, while you're successful. So clearly the, Boeing purchase was a big deal. And then number two, you went to the airports where they were not, the big guys were not three, it sounds like you flew routes, like Breeze and Avelo we're doing here in the States today that you're flying routes that are generally not the same routes as the big airlines. Is that the case? And, did you do those right in the beginning? Or we can also, I should add. As an additional, you know, those airports, you're operating it are a lot less expensive than other airports. The bigger airports. Did you do those things? Well, in the beginning, did you did you stick with it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, we did. And we were very clever bit cheeky, you know, calling Beauvais Paris. And it's about an hour and a half out, but if you're paying 20 bucks versus the World Cup rugby is on at the moment and all the carriers are screwing. the passengers I heard of, a one-way ticket back from Paris up to 800 euros and the guy actually said, screw that. I'll go via Brussels. And he actually got, for 150 to get back to Dublin. Yeah, the regional airports were really important. You know, thank God for World War Two. I know that sounds naughty and NATO because they built so many bloody airports around Europe Scandinavia and Germany and so on, as you know, well military and commercial can work very well. At the same airport. So that's what we did. And you get a bit of size what happens is you say, I remember we had a great issue. I'll talk to you about tiger in a minute. We had a great issue years ago in Manchester, where they up the fares the passenger charge. And we moved everything, everything like, you know, let's say six airplanes that I say they're seven out of Manchester to Liverpool, up the road and Manchester changed their mind within, A week, because there's rivalry between the 2 cities and the last thing they could do is not have Ryanair come into it. One of my favorite stories on airports is Tiger. Where the differentiation between the budget terminal and the main terminal was 10 bucks and that year, we actually, let's say, we carry 2, 000, 000 passengers that year. Our profit was directly around 10 dollars net and I said, Jesus, you know, that's down to the airport transaction. So, you know, if you think like that. It's different today, but if you think like that, maybe your profit is what you negotiate on airports, then, you become like, I don't know, you become like a wall street trader who is just focused on getting the trade, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, I know we're going to talk about advanced air mobility a little while, but you just sprung something on me Dec that I'm going to ask and let me see if it's a simple answer or not. If not, we can postpone it. Is it conceivable with the air taxi revolution, I'll call it that they could play a similar role with the routes and the airports and the competition for the airports, whereby they could serve an entirely new market. I know it's going to be expensive in the beginning, right, because the pilots and other costs, but is it possible they could revolutionize aviation? Have you ever sat back and said there's an opportunity here as long as they can keep their costs down, which in the beginning they may not. But is there a possibility that the air taxi market could change air travel in this respect in a similar way that Ryanair did?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know if it'd be exactly like Ryanair, but I don't see any reason why it couldn't be. We're looking at the economics on the passenger side at the moment and it's an issue. We have to get the cost further down than what the OEMs are talking to us about for eVTOL. On that point Jim, one of the things that comes straight to mind is on the passenger side about utilization, and we're really good at utilization of our assets, that is going to be an issue with some of the eVTOL operators, wherever they are, and, on the passenger side. We have to get the on the cargo side as well, but we're kind of 100 percent focus on cargo at the time. I'm going to get killed for this comment, but I don't think the pilots should be called pilots on the FAA may shoot me or, Boeing or Beta or any of the guys out there who are involved in the industry. But, I've called them something else. I call them technicians because if we screw up the cost of pilots, that's going to come back. if you take that a captain, I know it's a stark reality, but I know that the carriers in the U S who are paying 500, 000 a year for a captain. Their only place to go now is actually bigger airplanes. And right for the industry. So I call, I would call the pilots technicians. I know I'm going to get shot for that. we're looking at the engineers to be actually pilots as well. And, engineers are very intelligent people. For example, we're looking for an Uber driver who we can convert into an eVTOL driver just to prove the point and we'll get somebody who can do it. We have a search around Dublin, so if any taxi lads are out there and they want to become a technician on an electric aircraft, please give me a call. But, you know, the point I'm trying to make here is, this is an opportunity for the industry to get the calls right from day 1 and, let's not make mistakes that commercial aviation has made in the past.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a very interesting thought. Very controversial as well. Let's put a pin on it for now. Let's go back to airlines and LCC models and talk a little bit about the propensity for LLC airlines to adopt technology faster than legacy carriers. Is that true? It is and give us some concrete examples of how technology has been adopted at Ryanair besides internet and, and some of the others that you mentioned already.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know the exact number, but I know Ryan air, for example, has invested in Ryan air labs and places like Poland and other destinations where they have three or 400 people who are just on the technology side, we started Viva Columbia 10 years ago. Yeah. And our main competitor who eventually bought us last year, Avianca, their I. T. department was Jurassic in Avianca and the other legacies down there. And we effectively. We're able to dive into the internet I think we forget in the industry when we have an app on the phone, how transformational that has been to the airline industry. Obviously the Ryanair app is very good, but, low cost guys, when they start. Can do an app within a couple of weeks and, the thought process is not Jose, who's been in it for 50 years. It's, young guys and girls who effectively are probably more focused on Tic Toc than they are on travel agents or Amadeus and so on. So I know it sounds simple, The legacy guys, if you look at them their IT departments are huge and when you're starting up, you can be very cost sufficient with the use of social media, as well as the Internet and, some of the. Providers of the middlemen on the agency side have, have come up with some good And I would include uh, uh, Amadeus and that when they bought Navitaire.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dec, what other technologies do you see on the horizon that you're excited about in terms of continuing to lower the cost? And also, following from that question, how much more room is there in general to remove costs in the airline industry today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>the cost one, there's a very interesting comment with regard to the first part of the question, a pal of mine works in Google. He's very senior in Google here in Ireland. Google have eight and a half thousand people. And he said, you guys are crazy. And I said, you know, Jesus, why, you know, what, what have we done wrong again? He wasn't talking about Ryanair. He was talking about all the airlines and he said. If we had customers that came into a unit of Google, we would be able to say to you, here's a deal about carrying baggage or here's a deal about hotels. would eat the data of somebody walking into an airplane and you have them like in a closed environment flying with you for a couple of hours. I don't think the carriers think enough about that, that data is gold and I don't think the carriers treat it as gold It's a really good question about the future and costs. I'm a bit worried about that, Luka. And the reason I'm worried about it is, if you look at ATC and pilots as an example, the only way costs are going are up. And I don't know what the LCC carriers do because they do lose a lot of pilots to the legacy guys because of the salaries and the type of airplane and so on. So I'm worried about the future on the cost side. If you take something, we won't spend hours on it, but ATC is a problem around the world. It's a big problem in Europe. I think it's a bigger problem than the, USA, I don't know why the actually monitor and manage. I heard a figure recently is that the air traffic controllers, the capacity they have, staff wise is something like 54% percent for the New York area. that's a very scary figure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Couple of things to ask, so one was and yes, you're probably not far off given recent conversations we've had with some of the busy slot controlled airports and the capacity, when you say the ATC is a problem, how, what do you mean? Is it charges? Is it capacity? Is it efficiency? What's the problem you're defining more so in Europe than in the United States?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I know this is going to sound funny, but when Italy played football for an international match, All the ATC guys booger off, I know that sounds kind of like dad's army, but that's what happens the French strike at the turn of a coin and a lot of airspace that France controls a lot of carriers go through, my understanding is the whole ATC requirement for Europe could be done by any of the countries like Ireland could do it just out of their ATC system, Germany and so on. So you just think of the inefficiencies that are happening there. I give you 1 example, and it's kind of a little bit away from causes when we had the ash cloud here in Europe. We had 27 different definitions of what an ash cloud is because of the EU way of working. You know, like, why don't we just do what the Alaskans and the Indonesians do? And no fly zone of 50 miles, but we had fucking, excuse my French. We had bloody definitions of what ash cloud is.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm going to go back to a question. Luka asked if I may. So let's say you had a 300 person technology lab for an LCC and. And you had a whiteboard and one half of the whiteboard was, revenue generation opportunities with technology. And the other side was cost reduction opportunities. Which side of the whiteboard is most filled for an LCC today in their technology laboratories?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's a great question because one side of the whiteboard will be focusing on how the app and other IT platforms can reduce the cost. But the guys on the revenue side and auxiliary services side, might make a case that every time somebody goes on our app that they spend X and that's revenue led. So there, there's a bit of a contradiction in the labs. I don't know in detail, but you can drive the cost down with technology, but there's a revenue angle to it as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With cost being such a critical factor in the strategy of a low cost airline, there's gotta be a tendency to intentionally or non intentionally to cut corners a little bit. So how does an LCC carrier balance providing a low cost operation and affordable travel while at the same time, maintaining high safety standards and passenger satisfaction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, a couple of things. If you look at the ULCC safety record, it's very good. It's excellent in my terminology or in my view low cost carriers know that if they have an incident that it could be very damaging to the airline, I think one of the worst safety records in the world. I'm going to be shot for this, but that's not new is Air France, but everybody thinks Air France is safe, the safest airline and so on. But, you know, just think about it, guys. Safety is everything and, that's not a glib comment and we take it very seriously. For example, one of the things we did in Ryanair and we did it in all the carriers is the head of safety reports to the board and doesn't report to the CEO. And I know that sounds simplistic. But it's brilliant because the chairman who we get are always fantastic aviation people who sleep, eat, and drink safety. And the CEO he can't get involved. LCCs don't cut corners, but the perception is they do cut corners. the reality also is, I'm not too sure how much the passengers look at the airplane when they're getting on. They just, you can see it as a bus, but with regards to safety they always make the comment that Qantas is the safest airline in the world. And they do have a great record and it's run by a great Irish guy called Alan Joyce. I'd love to be the head of safety for Qantas because the airline takes off once or the airplane and it, it's up in the air for 14 hours. If you think about the Ryanair network or the Southwest network, the utilization and landings and takeoffs that they do is just incredible. So, it's not talked enough about in the industry. I think the industry needs to reaffirm to passengers how good our safety is but nobody has taken on that manful look, look at it, guys, when you get a chance to record of LCCs around the world is. Right up there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's a very interesting comment about Qantas. I haven't thought about it that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The other point on that Luka is we create a relationship. This might sound funny, but we create a relationship with the local CAA or FAA or DGAC. And that relationship really is strong, and we asked them what they want us to do. There's terrible arrogance in Lufthansa or Aer Lingus or British Airways. Well, you know, we're not going to be told what to do. LCCs really work on their relationship with the authorities and, the authorities love that because you're taking them seriously and you're looking for advice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned, An interesting comment earlier about passengers and how they're not completely honest in how they rate the most important factors that drive their purchasing decisions for airlines. Tell us a little bit more about your observations and your thoughts on passenger satisfaction. What matters to them the most? And how do passengers look at LCCs versus legacy carriers?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't think they look at it in huge detail because the driver for them is the fare as I said, I'm not too sure people will admit that. Passengers believe in LCCs because of people like Southwest and Ryanair and how long they've been around and so on. But, I don't think they're truthful when it comes to the reason they pick Southwest versus American, some of the comments is, food, you know, LCC food is crap. They pick other reasons. it's the airports near my house. they just don't want to admit. That they're being cost efficient and it's kind of funny because what's wrong with being cost efficient.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right? I mean, if you look at it from that angle, then isn't everybody converging on an LCC model? What really then sets apart legacy from LCC if there's a relentless pursuit of cost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think you've answered it because there is a relentless view on cost and recently in Columbia we put in charge a guy a very good guy is actually Irish and he, used to work with Irelandia, a guy called John Good. We put him in as a VP of, competitiveness. And I got the idea from the Colombian government. They have a minister for competitiveness and. The beauty about saying somebody's in charge of competitors in the story if you want to use efficiency or whatever you can stick your nose into every meeting in the company because you're trying to make it more efficient and it's also a great signal for people we are serious about being efficient.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what really defines in the LCC, perhaps we should have put that up at the front of our conversation, but what is an LCC as opposed to legacy? And if we think about any new emerging airline, are they all basically a low cost airline? Is that even a relevant term anymore?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah I think the terminology of low cost has been, beaten to death by the industry. And, you'll start seeing terminology in American or United trying to get the message across that their fares are cheap. You know, the barriers of being a legacy carrier versus LCCs are just ginormous. You have the pilots issue, you have unions, you have the engineers, you have the cabin crew, you have, 60 years. I'm thinking of American, you have 60 years of, cost creep. I remember when B. A. were looking at buying Ryanair, we put a clause in the contract, it never came through, but we put a clause in the contract that we would get something like a half a million dollars every time we got a phone call from the HQ and British Airways about the operation, because, the last thing we wanted to do was talk to the chairman of one of your partners, because he'll just say to you my sister, Nancy is on the flight tomorrow. Would you give her a gin and tonic, screw that, you know, just anything that's going to add costs, just, avoid it at all costs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so Dec, you've either started or been part of or worked at Ryanair, Viva, Tiger, Allegiant, even America West. As you look around the world and you look at opportunities to either start or partner or buy an airline, what's the low hanging fruit for you? What are you looking at? And again, I'm introducing now listeners right now who are coming from the advanced air mobility world, and they're trying to hear how you evaluate opportunities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The great example for us would be Allegiant. What Maury Gallagher does with Allegiant is amazing, but nobody gives them credit for it. So, when we looked at being a mezzanine financing partner for them we were just blown away by their knowledge of MD 80s I think 95 percent of the routes didn't have any competition. when you think about going to Vegas. And you're from, let's say, somewhere in Montana, and there's a flight every day to Vegas, and you booked it, and you're saying to your partner, what happens is, and this reason leads into successful when it comes to Vegas is, you start thinking about what you want to do when you're in Vegas, and it's six months out. Oh, Jesus, U2 are playing this week or we haven't been to the Grand Canyon and so, Allegiant was a great example. And one of our shareholders said that allegiance is boring and he didn't want to invest. And it was actually my dad and he said, they're boring. He said, don't go near it. So anyway, we did it and we made a lot of money out of it. And the headlines in the paper was my dad being so bright about Allegiant and nobody knew he wasn't the shareholder and he, said it was boring. And when the results came out about our investment and the IPO, he rang me up and he said, boring is good. And I said, yes, it is. I'm not calling allegiance boring. His view was, it was boring, but. They were exceptional and, and, and to this day, they don't get the recognition they deserve. So that was a great example of us looking at a company and the three guys who came back who were doing the DD, they all said we should buy into it and they all put their own personal money into it as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what they saw there was a boring, low cost carrier that was flying routes that were largely non\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>competitive. Exactly. And, the biggest operator in Vegas at the time was Southwest they just totally ignored Allegiant, you know thank God but there is carriers who don't get the recognition and I would put Frontier in there as well. I think Barry Biffle does a great job in Frontier, but Allegiant and Mari is just a great example of somebody doing really well and maybe not screaming off the rooftops.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's tough to talk about low cost carriers and great airline leaders without talking about David Neeleman. And obviously with the airlines he started, including JetBlue and Azul and in many different places. Now with Breeze, what's your take on what does Dave Neeleman do really well? And what could he do better?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He is world class at launching airlines and raising money after that I think he should go away and leave the operation alone because I don't think he is an operator like we are. And I'm not urinating on them. I'm just saying that, what happened with JetBlue, I thought was very sad when they I know it sounds like a death, I'm not trying to be morbid about it or like Leonard Cohen, but effectively, when they decided to go for the Embraer, they were throwing up any possibility of being low cost because you have to have the same type of airplanes to be a successful. So, Neeleman a great guy. He's nothing compared to Michael or Herb. He's world class at setting things up. He's world class at selling them as well. And the jury is still out on Azul down in Brazil. But listen, he did a good job. And also Brazil is a very hard market. But he only did it because he was a Mormon. And, you know, I'm not being funny here, but effectively, he had done his earlier catechism or whatever you call it for religion. He, had spent time down in Brazil. But, you know, let's not go into detail there because talking about the Brazilian market is you know, it's very sad. It just it just they can't get their cost down.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>48:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I've read that you've not been a fan of the Brazilian market. Now the Brazilian market has been talked up a little bit on the air taxi side because of all the different places people could take off and land where it's not otherwise available for traditional aircraft. Would you say that could be potentially an interesting market in an area where you are otherwise not a big fan of air travel or air travel investments?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah just one comment. I stupidly said the country was corrupt and my partner at the time said, obviously, we don't want to go to Brazil for the next 20 years. But, I do think there's a lot of issues with regard to. And not just Brazil. Peru is a real eyesore when it comes to corruption as well. But anyway, park that to the side. Yeah, I think Brazil's a very interesting opportunity. Certainly on the cargo and the oil side. On the passenger side, I think at the beginning it will just be the people who use helicopters. But remember, 80 percent of helicopter use around the world is for oil the other 20 percent is for passengers. So it's an interesting market. Mexico City will be an interesting market. But I just, I don't know if there will be low cost. I don't know enough at this stage. A lot of the deals with the airlines. I'm not too sure the LOIs are that serious. And what I mean by is, United, taking a warrant and some other carriers taking a warrant that's effectively a financial transaction. I haven't heard yet from any airline and we're starting to research how they're going to operate eVTOLs and I think that is still a question mark and a responsibility that anybody who wants to use it for passenger basis, hasn't answered. You know, where is it gonna land? What's the landing fee? Who's going to handle it? The issue on pilots versus technicians nobody has mapped out operationally. And we hope to do it in Europe how this market is going to be efficient cost wise. I haven't seen American or United or Delta look at this opportunity in any serious way. I think Scott Kirby, when he looks at it in detail, we'll say, Jesus, we shouldn't operate this. We should get X to operate it and, I think that's what will happen. There's probably not enough opportunities. Some lunatics will operate it himself. and the reason I say they're lunatics is they're only gonna bring cost to the market, so I think it needs a new fresh page and you need to say what needs to happen cost wise for this to make sense.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Where's the river of cash with advanced air mobility? Whether we think about drones drone delivery, air, taxi, electric aircraft, where do you see the big opportunity to be able to operate effectively and get a good return on investment?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, we're still looking at that and we've been talking to the OEMs primarily in the US and Brazil. But we think the opportunities is cargo to start with. And, you know, the question that everybody needs to talk about in more detail is autonomous flying. And, I don't see any reason I'm going to get shot as usual. I don't see any reason why cargo airplanes need pilots, right? So, therefore, I'm going to get assassinated on that. But when you think about it, there's no passengers on board. And effectively they fly in the middle of the night and don't need pilots, but, you know, that's going to come. It's a bit like the Internet, the US military had the Internet operational for 10 years before they told anybody about it. So I would really watch what's happening in the military sector. they have their own certification process. What they'll do with eVTOL and electric aircraft might well lead the way the passenger market goes. Sorry, guys, I just want to bitch about one thing terminology. I didn't go to Harvard, but why the hell are we still calling them drones? a pal of mine had the idea of calling them doves. I'm not trying to do marketing now, but you know, all my kids are young adults, but they say to me, Why do you use the word drone? Because that reminds me of Hamas and Israel and military stuff. What would you call them? Dec? I don't know, but I wouldn't bloody call them drones. I really wouldn't. And, you know some of the other terminology just drives me crazy, but, hopefully we can deal with that. What we're going to do in Europe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's linger a little bit on the skills and the competencies that are transferable from the low cost airline to an operator of commercial drones at scale. and let me refine this question. So if you were to put together a team to run operations of, small UAS cargo missions at scale, what are the talents? What are the competencies that you'd be looking?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's topical because we were actually talking about it today in the office. If you take an AOC, that's going to be the requirement for operating these airplanes. I would say to the regulatory authorities, and we have a great regulatory authority here in Ireland, the IAA, the person in charge of the engineering side for the AOC should be a battery guru. And this debate is going on there is avionics and other parts to the aircraft that are important. But I think we have to kind of flip it upside down and say, what's required, the three things I think that you need for an AOC is a safety person, a flight ops person, and somebody on the maintenance side. I'd love to get my hands on a Taiwanese person who's been in batteries all their life because, this is what it's all about. And I don't know if the DGAC or the CAA or the IAA will actually agree with that approach, but it is approach we'll, we'll ask them about. And in the end, they make the decision. I think the other efficiencies is trading in airplanes, which we're very good at and that's important to get the price right. And it's important that all the other stuff that comes with the airplane, like training and maintenance and so on needs to be knuckled in. And so we're good at order. We've ordered over 220 Airbus aircraft through our history. And we're kind of agnostic when it comes to OEMs. We think Beta and Joby will be the leaders maybe Embraer and saying something like that we will have to, and I think we're going to, get deals for eVTOLs, and I hate that word as well, but anyway, eVTOL we should ring Steve Jobs in heaven and ask him to come up with names for the industry, but we have skill sets operationally as well, and we, we think different. You know, we're a pain in the ass, but we think differently. And there's lots of opportunities out there, but, I'd love to do the podcast and 2 years time and say, this is, I was wrong about all that, but here's where the golden nuggets are. So we're in the infancy it's embryonic not just for us, but for everybody. And maybe airports are irrelevant. I know that sounds funny, but maybe they are irrelevant. And if you have to land and JFK. you land in an area close to JFK I know that legacies wouldn't like this, but certainly in cargo you can do it, but, the transfer for other passenger from the eVTOL to the aircraft can be done in a more efficient way. Another conversation guys, but we, I won't bore you tonight is airports. Haven't changed in 4 million years and effectively security has made it worse experience for passengers. I was getting on a flight in JFK and we were told to take off our shoes. And a guy behind me, an elderly guy behind me hollered, there hasn't been a shoe bomb for 25 years. You know, I just thought it was brilliant. So anyway, the airports have to change as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>56:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I agree. we complain often about the, whole airport experience ourselves as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>56:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, it should be like a train.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>56:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But guys, let me throw something out real quickly. I mean, the airport experience, I'll tell you here in the northeast, it's got a whole lot better with, New York LaGuardia, for example, is extraordinary compared to what it used to be. But something you're saying Dec that we really want to call out and you may be right. This may be a separate topic, but if there's the ability to be able to reduce the cost of the airport, maybe at the end of the day, they are monopolistic areas. If you can get now 30 to 40 different landing pads around New York City, where vehicles, drones, cargo delivery can operate, I would assume the effect on the cost of the big airports would be dramatic. So that effect from advanced air mobility could be, beneficial to everyone.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>we're investors in skyports who do both infrastructure they're a great company run by a guy called duncan walker he came from property so he only thinks like property but they do infrastructure and services with smaller drones and so on they think these vertical airports as they call them or airpods they can be built anywhere and they're doing a lot of work in dubai so you know maybe airports are irrelevant to the market. The legacy guys are going to shoot me for that. But I think that's the way we need to think,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>you can get shot a lot as a result of this podcast.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, but, you know that's nothing new, but, but I do think we have to think very carefully about it. do I really want to pay Heathrow, I don't know, 200 quid to land on the passenger side, or the same amount for, 50 or up to 500 kilos. I don't think.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Given that there's many entrepreneurs in our audience can you talk a little bit about some of the common mistakes that you see when entrepreneurs are trying to do business with airlines?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>God, I haven't thought of it in that way.

But there's technology that helps them. So how does an airline evaluate a business case?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I really believe the industry is woeful when it comes to innovation and new ideas, and we can talk about that another day. But one of the questions we ask ourselves is if Steve jobs was around and he was doing an airline, I think the closest thing to it might be jet blue, but he would do it differently. And, that's the kind of thinking we need. Entrepreneurs trying to sell into airlines. I think the critical comment there is your first pitch is to the CFO and if you can convince the CFO and it's not easy because the CFO will send you off to handling or engineering or so on. But I think there's a real opportunity where you can convince the CFO that there's savings to be made here. That's where I would go, but it's not easy and not all the CFOs are rock stars.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We're coming up to the end of the podcast here, but I was intrigued by your comment about innovation being pretty bad in the sector. Give us a snapshot of it at least and then we'll save the more detailed discussion for a later podcast.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>airports wise, I think that's easy, to make the experience a lot better you know, coming 2 hours to the airport for a flight is just a joke. And, the airlines aren't in control, it's, become a new industry and, security is just not. No, I'm just, I want to be careful here. 9 11 was a great opportunity that the security industry hatched onto. Innovation. I don't see enough innovation from the OEMs, talking about the the Boeing's and the Airbus's of the world. And it's not an industry. Like if you take iPhones or you take other products that people use every day They're not innovative. You know we were asked by Boeing years ago what you would do differently than today. And my bugbear idea was to refuel the airplanes in flight. And I tell you where I was doing that. We were operating Tiger into India and there was kind of like a 37% tax for fuel out of India. I think it was around that figure. So I said, Jesus, why don't we just take off? And the minute we're over, Sri Lanka, we refuel the aircraft. the passengers wouldn't even know. And, people just don't look at it in that way. And by the way, there'll be 20 engineers telling me how it can't be done, but you know, there needs to be innovation. And by the way, maybe the answer here, guys, is the innovation doesn't come from the OEMs that it comes from different sides of the market. But in the end, you have to get the OEMs on side. But I think the OEMs for eVTOL are thinking differently, particularly and, and, and Joby.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about all the innovation as it relates to decarbonizing aviation? Do you think that the industry is behaving rationally and realistically with respect to the goals that it has set for sustainable aviation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, this is the bullet that's going to certainly kill me. I think it's a joke. all the airlines are ticking boxes to be seen to be green and focus on all the omissions and so on. But I, haven't seen anything from passengers where they say, oh you know, Ryanair or Southwest or Viva Colombia are very bad when it comes to the climates and they aren't, cows farting that's worse than aviation and so on. I do think the industry is ticking the box. I think eVTOLs can really help that because they're electric and they'll be seen as more efficient and so on. I just see the legacy guys, we won't go into this conversation now, but I don't see SAF is the solution. I think it's part of the solution. Somebody years ago told me to make SAF work in Europe you have to grow the size of Belgium and crops to make it happen. So I don't think there's push yet from the passengers. There will be, and it's probably the next generation. It's probably kids that are in school now, but legacies are being seen to do stuff and talk about it, but I'm not too sure it's real.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Where do you see opportunities for innovation and aviation?

And that's not Einstein stuff. That's just data would be a big issue. And I think the airlines and entrepreneurs need to look at it, but I think it will come from an entrepreneur I don't think it will come internally from an airline.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are you most excited about as it relates to the future of aviation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Chinese. I know the Chinese will come to a state with Comac and other facilities for the aviation industry that will be good. And I think there's the kind of political game on the moment that, don't give them too much technology and so on. let's take the eVTOL, market, they're going to authorize a Chinese operator that will be safe, that will operate in China and they'll probably do it quicker than anywhere else. I, think the Chinese can really add to aviation. My dream primarily is airports, but I know that sounds very geeky. But my other dream would be about the availability of a new OEM because Boeing and Airbus does have a duopoly. There's an example of making aviation hard today. You go to Airbus and they'll tell you that we have an aircraft available in eight years time and you kind of go, Jesus, why would I even bother? So the innovation needs to be on the OEM side and if Steve jobs or anybody else like that maybe the guy who runs Airbnb was allowed to do innovation, it would be great for the industry, but I don't think we have innovators. I don't think we have entrepreneurs\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>is now a good time to\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Declan:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>start a new airline. Jesus, no. And the reason I say that is let's say you take the U. S. pilots, ATC the OEMs, there's so many issues going around. I don't say that with any kind of glee, but certainly all our focus in Irelandia aviation in the future is going to be on electronic carrier sort of airplanes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about supersonic?

Supersonic for me is like a drunk uncle at the wedding. You know, I just don't see it happening. I think it's a dream.

And I, I just can't see where it makes sense. if I go from New York to London and I save two hours, is it that relevant? I think it's more kind of peacock stuff. You know, I came in on Concord yesterday and I came to the meeting, you know, just. At the drop of the hat and all that kind of stuff, but I wish the industry would focus on cost and really look at the current innovations, electric,hydrogen, solar those are really interesting opportunities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Great.

We have the pleasure of doing a deep dive into this interesting topic with Christiaan Hen, Chief Customer Officer at Assaia, a company with the vision to improve safety, efficiency, and capacity of the air transportation system by bringing transparency and order to ground operations.\u003Cbr/>\u003Cbr/>We start the conversation with an analysis of the process of turning aircraft around at airport gates: the different parts of the process, the relevant metrics, the various stakeholders involved, and the limitations of existing methods used to manage the turnaround process and broadly gate management.
