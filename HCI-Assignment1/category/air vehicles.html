For those of you who've been listening to many of our last several podcasts discussions, especially those with Rob Britton and Jeff Luckett, you'll find our discussion with Kevin a perfect follow on. After discussing areas where some may disagree with Kevin, we launch into an overview of electric aviation. And the industry that blossomed due to its introduction. Kevin also discusses that the electric-only industry hasn't seen the battery progress that many had hoped, which has pushed back the timelines of many fully dedicated electric vehicles. We also discuss how electric only vehicles especially eVTOL have more limited near term use cases. We then talk about hybrid propulsion versus electric propulsion. We discuss what parts of hybrid propulsion are changing the fastest today, and it's different and unique use cases. We then discuss why an operator in regional air mobility would select an electric vehicle versus what some would consider the more obvious choice of hybrid electric propulsion. We delve a bit deeper into regional air mobility and how overall electrification may increase the use of regional air mobility. We discuss the pluses and minuses of pure electrification hybrid and traditional aircraft on regional air mobility as well. Kevin wraps up our discussion with some great advice for our innovators and entrepreneurs. Kevin, thanks for joining us for a terrific discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Kevin Noertker, as you profitably innovate in The Vertical Space. Kevin Noertker is co-founder and CEO of Ampaire. Over the past eight years, Kevin and his team have pioneered practical, compelling electrified flight through the upgrade of existing aircraft types. In 2019, they flew the world's largest hybrid electric aircraft. In 2020 and 2021 they deployed and demonstrated electrified flight with multiple airlines across the globe. With over 23,000 miles flown hybrid and 12 plus regulatory flight approvals across three countries to date, they're a leader in hybrid electric aviation. Prior to Ampaire, Kevin contributed engineering and program management expertise to advanced aircraft and satellite technology development programs at Northrop Grumman and as a research fellow at Caltech and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An entrepreneur at heart, Kevin is driven to apply the science and engineering disciplines of large aerospace organizations to pressing environmental problems here on Earth.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, Kevin, welcome.

The first is, we're in sustainable aviation and there's a lot of talk about new design planes and new markets, eVTOL and, high speed new design jets. And first is, I believe that we need to start with propulsion rather than airframe design. And there's a whole lot of good that you can do with new airframe designs, but novel propulsion is how we've seen these transformative moments progress in the past, whether that's the dawn of powered flight or the jet age. And I think you need to get the propulsion right before you start doing the transformative vehicle designs. There'll be a lot of people out there that might disagree with me on that one. Number two is that,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, I'll just, if I could jump in. I had a very senior transportation leader call me last week and say exactly\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>that's great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After listening to so many of our podcasts, he called me up and said, I want to talk about propulsion. And then I, as we were preparing for this, I was thinking, Oh, wow, this is perfect timing. So at least there's one person out there who agrees\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I appreciate that. Well, he and I should grab coffee sometime. I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp>great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And to add this strikes me as perhaps more commonly held view than perhaps you are alluding to. All the new technology waves in aviation revolve around or are enabled by new propulsion. So what is it about this particular statement that, the industry disagrees with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's the idea that you need to do the new airframe design with the new propulsion in the first embodiment. Ampaire over the years has gotten a lot of pushback from industry stakeholders about doing upgrades of existing aircraft types. But you can't capture the full opportunity, they say, by upgrading an existing plane, you really need distributed electric propulsion, or you need the new airflow augmentation, or your vertical lift features, and that they believe that those features are going to drive the adoption dynamic, and that propulsion retrofits which is the path Ampaire has taken, is not a sufficient starting place. I think that's where the differentiation comes in. Because certainly eVTOL, let's take as an example, requires novel propulsion. what I'm saying is we can decouple those as a first step. Not to belittle the benefits that you would get from a clean sheet design, or maybe it's ultra short takeoff and landing performance. But the fact that designing a plane around propulsion that is not yet certified, that does not yet exist, is a recipe for having to redesign that plane half a dozen times. And we've already seen people burn a lot of capital going through that path this turn of the wheel. But if you just look in history, I mean, this is new design planes that didn't do it around existing propulsion. That's one of the big gotchas in the, in the design space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And there was another thing that you wanted to flag.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This is going one layer down there for propulsion. Hybrid electric is the only approach that makes sense right now. There are many exciting technologies. Obviously, fully electric is a dream many of us have. There's some corner cases where fully electric might work. There are a lot of people pushing hydrogen, but the reality is just like on the ground. Hybrid electric is going to lead, it is the gateway technology to this future. And I think it's going to be the gateway technology for decades.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I didn't expect a different answer from you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'm talking about, anything with commercial relevance, where operating flexibility, that is range, payload, airports that you can fly to and from, anywhere in the economics, anywhere that matters, and you need to get to scale, hybrid electric is what'll get you there.

And everything else you have to place a bet on an unknown that's completely out of your control. Whether it's battery energy density or hydrogen costs or infrastructure. And, and hybrid doesn't place any uncontrollable bets. It's just about good execution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, elaborate on this point a little bit. Why is it that the industry doesn't think that hybrid is the way to go?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think back to when we founded Ampaire. And I think back to a lot of the people in this industry who have such deep passion for making a positive impact on the world around us. And those core motivations for many are about usually one of two things. Either they care deeply about the environment and they want a true zero emissions solution. And that forces their designs into a fully electric or, a strong hybrid where you're flying fully electric for some period of time, or a hydrogen where they can claim a, zero carbon emissions in flight, if it's a fuel cell. And so what you see is this desire to have a pure carbon, remedy. And that causes people to not prefer the hybrid electric type approaches or these hybrid approaches where, you know, 50 percent fuel savings, 50 to 70 percent in our vehicles is phenomenal, but it's not zero. And if you're here on only principle and unwilling to look at anything but the pure solution, then that would bias you against it. The second is, there are some people who are pushing toward this idea of you have to start with the absolute simplest, simplest possible architecture, even if it's not possible today. And electric is phenomenally simple. And the maintenance costs are super low, and in theory you can get the economics to play out, depending on your battery assumptions. And if you believe, if you have certain optimisms in that area, then you don't want to give yourself the complexity or the crutch of having to do the partial via hybrid solution. And I think that keeps some people away from it because they say, oh, batteries will get there. Like, let's just wait around for those. But I think they miss the point that if you can serve, 10 times the market size by using hybrid electric, and you're saving half the fuel burn on that. That's, do the math, it's five times the positive impact of a few or zero emissions on that one tenth of a market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Let's talk about electric aviation. Zoom out a little bit, catch us up on some of the major milestones in electric aviation over the last several years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, electric aviation has had some pretty amazing progress in the last decade or so. The earliest companies in this industry were founded in the, 2010s but very few were talking about them at that point in time. You had the starting of, the NASA X 57 program. By the time Ampaire was founded in 2016, there still really weren't that many companies that were publicly acknowledged doing work in this space. Since then, we've seen this, this, blossoming of ideas, of concepts, I remember, the first time, I think, Peter, you were, you might have even been there at the, Uber Elevate Conference out in Dallas in 2017. There's this industry that built up around the enthusiasm for electrification. And then you saw hundreds, I believe the number peaked at over 700 different projects in this space. A lot of ideas, a lot of people who really get excited about designing airplanes. And, want to go through the features. So, big milestones. You've had first flights, whether those are the flights of the Pipistrel Alpha Electro, or ultimately that being delivered to customers around the world. You have the first flights of various development program aircraft, Ampaire's first flight in 2019, and, subsequent iterations, for example, our, Caravan flight in, 2022. The industry's also made progress from, simple demonstration of flight capability to very specific capabilities. So in eVTOL, the progress of transitioning from vertical lift to fixed wing flight has been a, a big challenge where still only a handful of companies have safely made that transition or done so with a pilot on board. These are critical milestones that will drive confidence in adoption and ability to gain regulatory approvals on the, on the operations. You've seen some incremental progress along the battery energy density. standpoint, so a lot of folks are waiting for batteries to have significantly higher watt hours per kilogram, so the gravimetric energy density in the lithium ion batteries in particular. And we've seen some modest progress on that and some really amazing announcements. Some groups who are in the chemistry side trying to, get up toward, past 500 watt hours per kilogram, targeting 1, 000 watt hours per kilogram, pretty audacious goals. I think, the industry hasn't yet seen, as significant of progress as many had hoped, and that's, that's pushing back timelines for entry into service of the fully electric, fully electric vehicles. And then from a certification standpoint, some pretty big milestones. Back to 2018, where we were kicking off a ASTM committee around electric vehicle chargers, through all the SAE committees or other industry groups working together on certification. While these might not be the visible milestones that hit the press, there's certainly the milestones and progress that help move the industry forward. And so, watching folks get their first certification bases established, or get a, get means of compliance agreed upon, or special conditions, moving forward, ultimately looking, I think here in the next few years, we'll get the first full, regulatory approvals for commercial operation. And, and each of those are some of the very meaningful milestones that are, happening real time and coming up soon.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the surprises for me was, the lack of certification events following Pipistrel's EASA certification of their, Velis Electro aircraft in the LSA category that was back in the summer of 2020. And then earlier this year, I think in March, the FAA issued an LSA airworthiness exemption for that same aircraft. But here we are four years later and no other electric aircraft has been certified. Why do you think that's the case? What's the bottleneck? about the.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think the, there are a few things. One is, the regulatory basis for certification. And the Pipistrel products didn't fully open up the Part 23 or the vertical lift, certification arena. it was in a different category initially. And I think that while it made progress and maybe others could have taken their products through that same, the, you know, the identical regulatory pathway, many of the products that are out there that we most were paying attention to are in Part 23 or the vertical lift category, which was not as fully opened up through the Pipistrel application. Think second was a bit of the dynamics in the market, so with the pandemic in 2020, I think a lot of milestones were dragged out a bit. 2021, money was easy, and I think that meant that money went to moonshots. So easy money doesn't mean it goes to practical, near term, near term wins. And so I think that a lot of the money that was being invested in late 2020 and throughout 2021 was going toward long horizon plays. So purposefully not aiming at super near term strategies. And I think that overfunded those, and we've seen many get significant funding, but then burning through it, and I think it underfunded the pragmatic strategies. and so what you saw was further pressures on or delays to the timelines for entry into service for those that might not have been as flashy, but were, were just making the, the next increment of meaningful progress. And then we've seen the retrenchment of the markets where now there's a bit of a recoil. I think, the industry's at risk of losing credibility. Given all the claims that were made and failed to be lived up to, whether that's certain timelines, or product performance, or cost metrics for the products. And so, I think the industry, in particular the capital allocators, may be licking their wounds from those moonshot projects that didn't play out, which doesn't help again those that are near term. What it does is it pulls back more capital away from everything, and so if you're looking at that as a lowering tide, each of these dynamics I think is has pressed away from certification milestones that we might have otherwise hoped to see more rapidly after the Pipistrel's early successes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what about the maturity of the enabling technologies themselves and the certifiability of the motors and batteries. What's the status there? And I was recently catching up with another founder and we started talking about this and it was surprising to hear how the regulatory bodies are trying to apply traditional propulsion system requirements to electric motors. So for instance, I think there's a requirement somewhere in internal combustion engines that they need to be able to run for, I think it's five minutes in max rated power, whereas an electric motor reaches its thermal limit, a lot quicker, maybe within, two minutes or so before needing to throttle back. And so that is one contentious issue, allegedly as is the example of having dual magnetos in ICE engines, and does that translate into, you know, double architecture in electric motors, all of that increasing mass, increasing budget, and really not making that cost equation as favorable as initially expected. Do you have any insights into those aspects of how the bottlenecks are being tackled at the certifiability and the maturity of the technologies?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think that this gets to one of the really critical and core risks in the industry, which is the supply chain and the ability to not just invent something, but to produce it reliably many times at a good economics. That's really what builds the markets here. I think the regulatory bodies are trying to adapt to what they know. And, those adaptations, whether it's the Part 23 rewrite, which adapted combustion type expectations to, an opener, larger net for what kind of technologies could actually be used to meet those requirements. But in the details, they're still looking for that familiarity. So what's your mean time between failure? How long can you run at full power? What are the failure modes and effects, and making sure that you're going through the detail on that? This is the, the specifics that you get into when putting together your program certification plan, your means of compliance, or ultimately going through the testing for your, Type Certificate or STC, and it is, it's really where the rubber hits the road in the industry. I don't think that all the answers are there yet. I think there are the early entrance, certainly Ampaire is, at least to our knowledge, the only company working on a hybrid electric propulsion system certification program actively with the FAA. And so this means that we are, we're clearing many of those open questions actively with them and collaboratively with them. It also means that we have, expectations upon our supply chain that, emerge over time if something, for example, with the FAA, brings up or highlights a requirement that we did not expect. As you talked about with the motors. for these questions about redundancy, there's what you could expect as a technologist, like you'd understand the technology and you believe this to be true, some level of safety, let's say, but that does not mean that will be accepted on the first pass through certification. And in fact, I think that the first paths through certification are going to be relatively risk averse and risk managed in those setting a higher bar for redundancy, not giving you credit for levels of safety that you think you might deserve. So, case in point, for the lithium ion batteries, no matter what you do to the cells, no matter how you package those cells into your modules, no matter what physical, interconnect or disconnect controls you have that might mitigate thermal runaway, or physical barriers that might mitigate propagation or software layers that are on top of all of that. The belts and suspenders and layers of safety. At the end of the day, the FAA, probably rightly so at this stage, requires you to show that you have physical barriers that if you force the battery into thermal runaway, the vehicle will be safe. So you don't get, you don't get actual credit for everything below that. You need ultimate safety and then all the other stuff that you thought was going to be sufficient. And these are, again, I don't think it should be surprising to anybody that the earliest, earliest applications, we're going to take a, the most risk managed approach. But what it means is that when you're a battery engineer on your fully electric vehicle, you're now doubling the weight of all these additional systems when you thought you could get there just with a really good BMS algorithm. And so what it drives is the decisions and it drives the, ultimately the designs into corners that might not be viable given some of those early assumptions. This is why we pushed again toward hybrid electric, because with a battery pack, a third the size of a Tesla pack and able to take on the extra weight and the payload hit along with it for all these physical layers of safety, we still have phenomenal performance on our system. and I think that these are, these are areas where the industry is trying to navigate alongside the regulations to mature, the solutions and the risk, together.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, what electric aircraft are selling in meaningful numbers today that you're impressed by?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you say stelling, I'm gonna assume you mean where there's a cash transaction and somebody ends up with an airplane. in their hangar at the end of it, and right now the only airplanes that are selling, are the Pipistrel aircraft at this time. There are many organizations placing orders, pre orders for, eventual deliveries, but at this stage, very minimal on the actual sales in this market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Kevin, what are you seeing as the FAA's thought process for how industry is going to incorporate improvements in hybrid electric propulsion systems into these aircraft in the coming years. These aircraft are long lived assets. Batteries still seem to be improving pretty markedly over the years. Motor technology as well. So if you certify something, on the one hand, you're locked in at that point in time, are they going to use an STC method for bringing improvements in? Or is there something that is even more fluid for allowing that, that they have in mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's a really good point because the technology base is moving so much faster than the time scale of a vehicle life, right? These aircraft last 40 years. And the, batteries are improving on the, on the order of every two to three years, you'd expect people wanting an upgrade of their battery pack to the next generation, a little bit like people might want their new iPhone every few years. The way you go about certifying your product matters. And if you wrap everything into the type certificate, then you need to amend or update the type certificate when anything changes. And so that would require a supplemental type certificate for certain types of changes. Generally, propulsion systems, propellers, or airframe changes require a new type certificate, or a amendment, or a STC, supplemental type certificate. There are things you can change on an airplane without having to go get an STC. You could replace a conforming part with an equivalent part. You're able to show certain equivalent levels of safety. And so there are efforts to try to find ways that these components which would be replaced over time, let's use the batteries as an example. Batteries degrade over the cycles of use, and every few years you want to replace those. You have to go get an STC for the new battery pack are you able to use a TSO type of process? Basically a lighter version of those approvals. And it really depends on exactly how that battery pack was incorporated into the vehicle level certification. So is it part of the engine? Is it part of the aircraft? Is it a safety of flight critical component? And then as technology improves, One of the things in aviation is you lock yourself into the parts that you designed and that an in any change in that part requires a change in your regulatory approval. So as batteries improve, how do you go through that certification pathway? Again, generally, what I think the industry will see is we guarantee equivalent performance while providing improved performance. And that all you're doing when you're meeting the existing regulatory waterline is you're saying we're at least as good as we were previously, and we haven't changed any flight characteristics. The question will be, when do you want to take credit for that? When do you want to allow the operator to plan a longer route? You can give them more energy, which gives them more safety, or maybe it gives them more flexibility on how many, how many flight miles they can perform or when they need to recharge at the other end. But it might not be part of the underlying. certification, performance capability of the vehicle that you've, that you've sought from the regulatory body. Now, this is a nuance, but it's the difference between having to go through the full cert program for the new tech or just increasing performance but taking credit for an equivalent level of safety. One specific point here, in our hybrid system, I have triplicate redundancy in our hybrids. We are phenomenally safe, and I believe safer than a traditional combustion engine would be, where it's a single point failure for the traditional engine. And in our, in Ampaire's system, we have redundancy, two layers of redundancy in the combustion engine. And then also this independent electric system, which is able to carry you further as well. But am I going to get credit for anything more than a single engine capability? Probably not. and that's understandable, at least initially. And I think over time, what people, what you'll get is additional credit for those things from the regulatory body. And in the interim, when new tech, motors, or batteries come out, It'll be at equivalent levels of safety as what was there previously.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What components of the hybrid electric propulsion system are changing the fastest right now, be it the battery systems, the motors themselves, power electronics, or something else? What do you see as the fastest changing or evolving?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, the fastest changing components historically have been those which had the benefit of riding the coattails of other industries. Aviation, as big as we love it and believe it is, is much smaller than, as a market driver, than other forms of ground transportation. And so we have been the recipients of rapid technology improvement across lithium ion batteries as energy density, volume density and cost get brought down. The, the motors have been a, truly the underlying enabling factor in many of these cases. So the power density of motors is pretty phenomenal compared to where it was a decade ago. And we still see companies that are, and we work closely with companies that are pioneering in this space. And you can start, you're getting great efficiencies and really high, power density out of these motors. Where, certainly Ampaire has locked most of the components for our launch product, but we have a flying testbed where we're able to bring in new technologies, where we first flew a silicon carbide inverter, when we have brought in new motors, inverters, and energy storage tech. And it's really in those, the motors and batteries that most people are pushing firmly for innovation, and then a bit in the efficiency of the power electronics, but a lot of that currently is, seems like it's lab scale technology. And while our work with ARPA E and NASA enables us to make that move even faster, I hesitate to, to think that lab technology today is going to rapidly enter commercialization anytime soon. I think we've seen a consistent trend that timelines for those developments take much longer than, than the, the technology teams would, would have originally anticipated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is aviation going to continue to benefit from advances in the automotive industry around the batteries that they use? Or is there going to be a fork in the road where the needs of aviation diverge from what the auto industry is pushing towards?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, the auto industry used to have range anxiety. But then battery energy density got to the point that you can drive hundreds of miles. There's a sufficient charging network. So I don't see the energy density being what automotive is optimizing for anymore. Really, I think automotive is going to continue optimizing for cost, and we've seen that over the last few years. Bringing the cost of an EV down is the driver for adoption more than bringing the range up. Whereas in aviation, we're still in that bringing the range up is the requirement. And so this is a divergence in the optimization goals for the technology coming out of automotive. Now the question would be, even if the goals are different, is the state of the art, the state of knowledge and capability, is that going to improve? As folks go toward lower cost, are we going to also see emergent benefits for aviation? Absolutely. As people do innovation and build new types of electric machines, it's no longer just about what is Tesla using in a Roadster, it's about where the larger vehicles, your mid duty and heavy duty trucks, what are the power requirements for those vehicles. What are the energy densities required for those? And so it's this expanding fringe of requirements that I think will also drive a, an alignment in, in, in emerging technologies with what aviation is looking for. But the core of a ground car is, is less likely to directly align with aviation than it did over the last decade in my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Are the batteries that you would design around for your hybrid electric conventional takeoff and landing airplane, are they the same ones that you would design around for a VTOL aircraft? And the reason I ask is that, an additional difference that I've, come to appreciate with batteries for VTOL aircraft is the power output demand on them, especially requiring high power output at the end of the flight as the aircraft transitions back into vertical flight to make its approach at the landing pad. That's a particularly, stringent requirement on the battery system. For what you're doing, I don't know, maybe that still exists. Maybe it's the same battery. Maybe you, you can, use the same tech, but how do you think about that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a nuance that most of the world, unlike you, Peter, most of the world doesn't catch the nuance between the different types of batteries. The power density versus the energy density needs to be tailored for the application. And what's interesting is you gave two examples. I'll add one more in there around fully electric airplanes. So let's take your eVTOL, which is fully electric, but requires huge amounts of power at a low state of charge at the end of flight, right? So you need a power cell there. Then you have a fully electric airplane, which has a large amount of batteries. And so actually a relatively low C rate, especially if it's conventional takeoff and landing. You're not really draining where, for those listening, the C rate is the rate of charge or discharge. as a proportion of the total pack size. And so that, when you have a really large pack, relative to your pack size, you're not discharging that rapidly. And so those can be energy cells, because you don't really need that high power C rate. But then you go to a hybrid electric plane. And as I mentioned, our pack is about a third the size of a Tesla pack. These are pretty small, actually. When you come through our hangar, you see this battery is big enough to fly a Caravan, really. And that is because in a hybrid, you use the battery differently than you would in the fully electric. A small battery pack, but you still have pretty high power for takeoff and climb. Again, now you need a higher C rate. You need more of a power cell. And so for each application, you do actually have different requirements for the type of the type of chemistry you might consider, the, tailoring of that cell between energy and power, certainly the life cycle economics of the pack, the degradation over time, you might have great power or great energy, but if you only cycle 400 times, then are you useful? There's a, there's, there are all these pieces that go into the details of selecting a battery. And this is the challenge that some companies who are trying to do a one size fits all, cell or module for everybody, need to hit the high waterline or miss the, miss the mark on their, their certain markets. And this is again, why I think it's so important to have a more flexible design where let's say that I need to increase the size of my pack a little bit because I'm not getting exactly what I wanted out of my supply chain, where we can handle that. it's not ideal. We don't desire it, but when you have a, an approach, which is just a little bit more flexible than, the pure heart requirement, I think most eVTOL folks. A lot of the ones who have decided to in house their battery development is because they realize they will not get precisely what they need from anyone else, and they have to tailor it directly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Given the advantages of the hybrid propulsion to electric, why would the eVTOL or the electric plane companies go purely electric versus hybrid? What would be some of their rationale?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Number one is, that I hear from them is on the emissions. They want to be able to say they can operate fully zero emissions. Number two is a statement around, around complexity, the economics of maintenance and that's a, it's an interesting argument which, without being deep into the weeds, it's hard to validate or, dispute. All the weeds that I've been in have shown that fully electric still has a way to go before it's economically more viable. But those are usually why I see, that it can, there are other ancillary features, like, for example, noise characteristics are important for communities. Oftentimes the reason communities get upset with aviation is because of the noise. And hybrid electric does not fully eliminate the noise profile, to the extent that full, that fully electric does. Fully electric planes, if you've ever flown in one, it's like being in a glider a lot of the time. It's really beautiful. and I think that some people have hung their hats on the sound, and frankly, to their credit, if you're an eVTOL talking about flying to the city center of Manhattan, you better be thinking about sound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's not how people are going to scale in the next several years. At the end of the day, regional air mobility most likely is how a vehicle is going to scale in the next, let's face it, 5 to 10 years. And given regional air mobility, given the requirements of the vehicles, I'm guessing that hybrid is going to be the, the limitations of hybrid are not nearly as impactful as they would be if they go into city center. And how many city center flights are going to be occurring in the next five to ten years, and especially at scale. So my guess is a lot of people right now listening are saying, hybrid's the way to go. Why would they not be saying that, especially as we start to talk about regional air mobility?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so it depends on who they are. Let's say that you are an eVTOL developer. We know many. And you've spent the last half a decade, investing how many hundreds of millions of dollars into your pure electric design. That is tailored, that every inch of it is optimized specifically for your fully electric operation. You don't have volume, you don't have weight, you would have to redesign your plane in order to integrate a hybrid electric system. And I know this because I've worked with those groups, and we have shown that you can apply a hybrid electric system in. But shoehorning a hybrid into a combustion plane is one thing, that's where we enter the market. Shoehorning a hybrid into something which was designed for a little battery pack, is a completely different beast. And I think a lot of these developers have gotten so deep into their fully electric application that they don't have the payload and volume capacity to take on the hybrid electric into their current designs. And so,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But let's move on. Let's say, Kevin, sorry, great answer, but let's talk about the operators who are going to be purchasing these vehicles. Why would they consider a fully, let's again, let's step into regional air mobility. Why would they consider a fully electric plane with its, with some of its limitations? Obviously some pluses, but the hybrid I would assume is still less noisy, for example, than a traditional combustion engine. Why would they consider a fully electric plane rather than a hybrid for regional air mobility in the next 5 to 10 years? What's their rationale? Put yourself in the position of an operator who has to make that decision.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so I would ask, what's the risk? Am I, what, truly, what's the risk? The risk that I put down an order? Even if it's binding, I'm sure there are tons of outs that if it, if this doesn't meet my performance requirements, I don't have to buy it. And probably if I'm putting money down, it's going into an escrow that it can come back to me. Most aren't putting money down for the fully electric, type orders that are out there. And so I would look at it and say, I could place an order for a fully electric plane and if it doesn't pan out, great. If all of the Swiss cheese of good things going right doesn't occur, I probably got a boost to my marketing and brand along the way, and I'm not out any money at the end of the day, I could probably still buy a hybrid down the road. Now, the reality is a lot of these groups are falling behind in our order books, so, potentially they won't be as, as, as early as they would like, but if magic happens and the performance is what people would love electric to be, then I get the electric plane and everything that I needed. And so I think it's a risk posture that, the benefit of placing a signaling order outweighs the risk. And the key for me, as Kevin and with my Ampaire hat on, is those folks still place orders for hybrids. Right? Like, when I talk to folks, they're like, Kevin, this is the first thing that I actually have confidence is going to come to market. I'm going to place an order for this. And what's silly is some of those people still say, and by the way, we don't want to talk publicly about this because our brand is still like fully zero emissions, but we know that this is probably going to come in first. And so we'd like to take part in it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, in what way is certifying a hybrid configuration easier or more difficult compared to certifying a battery electric?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the hybrid, one of the reasons it's easier is the safety case. The safety case for our system in the, condition where you assume you have an issue with the electric vehicle system, which is really what is the novel, parts of the technology. If you're in a hybrid electric condition like ours, you fall back onto a combustion engine and you fly home safely. We have full cruise capacity. With our combustion engine, so there's no degradation or risk to that operation if you shut off the electric system in flight. You can't say that for a fully electric, or hydrogen, for example, system that, when you have an issue, maybe you have redundancy in the battery packs, but the level of safety that you can, that you can, take credit for in the hybrid is quite a bit higher. And, and certifying that is, is we believe going to be faster and lower complexity and lower cost than going fully electric. The second is around the size and, requirements on each of the subcomponents. So whether it's the batteries or the motors, when you look at the reduced consequence of an issue, you can also, take different or take a different balance on the, the probability of certain issues occurring. And, and so the holistic risk analysis for the, the safety case, we have a little bit more flexibility. And that means that flexibility translates into the supply chain and our ability to move a bit more quickly and getting those, getting those technologies through the certification program.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the expected efficiency gain of a hybrid electric conventional aircraft versus the efficiency gain that we are seeing from hybrid electric automobiles? And is there a difference? And if so, why? And then we can get into efficiency gain that you would see from just like retrofitting an existing airplane versus designing an airplane around hybrid electric. Especially for the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft because going to electric propulsion when you want to do distributed electric propulsion for vertical flight or for electric STOL, okay, we get that, right? There's a capability there that's earning its way onto the aircraft. But if you are going for conventional takeoff and landing, and you are looking for an efficiency gain, what can we expect to see?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the efficiency of these hybrid systems, and I, I see hybrid as this gateway technology that as the underlying technology improves directionally toward fully electric, all of it will first get proven out in these hybrid electric systems, conditions. One of the, one of the great drivers for adoption of hybrid electric is the fuel efficiency of the systems that, that we and have already demonstrated and have been flying tens of thousands of miles so far in our hybrid systems and demonstrated a 50% fuel burn reduction. During takeoff and climb cycle, we're up closer to 70 percent fuel burn reduction. So these are actual measurements, right? This is not just an Excel spreadsheet model. This is empirical data and is the kind of benefit that you can get in certain embodiments of hybrid electric systems. So this is, pretty, pretty significant fuel savings, even when you're looking at the, the opportunity of hybrid-electric on the ground, where, call it maybe a 40 percent fuel savings, to 50 percent fuel savings on the ground. And it's all about the specific architecture of the system that drives the beneficial economics. Fuel is one of the largest, if not the largest, operating cost for most airlines. And so the fuel burn reduction then drives a positive cycle for the economic viability of new routes and market growth and higher frequencies of service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What phase of flight are these efficiencies realized the most?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, if you're just looking at a pure percentage basis of fuel savings, takeoff and climb is where you're getting the biggest boost from the electric system in our current architecture. There are lots of different hybrid architectures, and we've got a few of them, but what we're launching into product, into market with is a integrated parallel hybrid architecture where we use the electric system effectively as a boost during the high power phases of flight and the combustion engine as a baseline load of power for the cruise and, and across the rest of the flight. So you get up to 70 percent fuel savings, during that takeoff and climb cycle. And then it levels off toward about 50 percent fuel savings during the cruise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I see. What's the state of the art in some of the metrics on the battery side? We talked a little bit about, well, we didn't talk numbers, but gravimetric specific energy density, both at the cell and the pack level, the cycle life that state of the art batteries are achieving, and the, battery pack cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the, the batteries, so watt hours per kilogram is the metric that we in the industry normally uses to measure the energy density. The target most are aiming for is right around 400 watt hours per kilogram at a pack level. We're not close to that today. When you're looking at the packs today, you're at, right around 200 watt hours per kilogram really depends on your cooling system and where you draw the dotted line on the battery pack itself and what you include as weight versus don't include as kind of wet versus dry weight for the pack. The cells themselves, are, I remember a few years ago seeing cells that were cresting through the 200s of watt hours per kilogram, and then you get folks who are talking about 300, even into the 400 watt hour per kilogram cells. I think I've seen announcements about cells that are even significantly higher than that. Unfortunately, I'm not an expert in the kind of the lab type chemistry that goes into these batteries and the art of understanding where along the long tail of getting from lab into production you are and in measuring the number of years remaining is very challenging. And so it's hard to tell what, like, state of the art for, for the development of new technologies sounds like it's pretty far ahead in these high watt hours per kilogram. I think the reality is the first battery packs that get adopted into market are going to be at a pack level, maybe even sub 200 watt hours per kilogram, when you're looking full scope, full scope weight of the system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And in terms of cycle life and cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Cycle life and cost are, generally tailored depending on what your application are. So if you've got a more exotic cell, a higher power or energy density, it'll probably have a lower cycle life. I've heard some of our industry peers talking about cycle lives less than a thousand cycles. I don't see how that makes a whole lot of economic sense when you have to be replacing the batteries so, so repeatedly. We think that a 2, 000 to 3, 000 cycles, maybe it's 2, 000 full depth discharge, but you're looking at, you know, that might give you 4, 000 or 5, 000 actual flight cycles on a, on a vehicle, that's not unrealistic when you're not working with the most exotic type cells. And from a cost, I think, we're pretty conservative assuming costs are going to be pretty, pretty high, and it's hard to tell what'll come out in full production once you actually get to scale, but being at$500 per kilowatt hour, I think would be a great outcome for the industry if we were able to get there. And, I wouldn't be surprised if the very first battery packs that came to market were quite a, maybe a multiple higher than that. So maybe a thousand dollars per kilowatt hour. Which gets pretty expensive, especially when you're looking at the very large packs for, for the fully electric vehicles, but is still somewhat manageable with the, with the hybrid electric approach.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to put some business perspective into the conversation and if we use, uh, maybe we can get to ultimately the use case that you are pursuing at Ampaire, but one of the common near term use cases for electric aircraft is often thought of on the conventional side as a flight school trainer aircraft. Now, putting aside that the current range restrictions do not enable flight schools to use electric aircraft for the entirety of the curriculum for flight training, but for most, missions, it's good enough. What I'm interested in is when you actually go down into the weeds that you've been in, how the business case for an electric, fully battery powered aircraft pencils out when you consider the fact that, conventional piston engines are an industry that's been around for decades, benefiting from huge economies of scale, exceptional safety records, it's in the several thousands annual units, a lot of the development and R&amp; D costs have been recovered already. I mean, you're going after a relatively low cost. And I think the engine, replacement on, in this type application is in the 30, 40, 50. maybe 70, 000 per engine, correct me guys, uh, if I'm off. Uh, but at any rate, uh, you have that on the one hand, and then you have an electric, aircraft with a motor that, needs to recover the certification costs and development costs, and is one that every, you know, thousand cycles needs to replace the battery, which can be, I don't know, 80, 000 or whatever the cost is. So when you bake all of these different things, does it really become an attractive option?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So this gets back to your first question around what might the industry disagree with me on, and it is this principle that the economics must make sense in order for people to adopt the products. There are a lot of people out there who assume government subsidies will get us there, or people willing to pay a green premium. And while certain cases that might be true, to hit the scale of adoption that's required, you can't achieve it without really compelling economic benefits for the end user and buyer. So this example that you gave around the, the training, especially in these smaller airplanes, is a great one. The market makes so much sense. The direct operating cost seems so low when you're only taking into account the industrial power that you're using. It's cents on the dollar for OpEx. But when you look whole scale and you're comparing yourself against a, sub 100, 000 airplane with relatively low cost of capital, it's probably fully depreciated, and you're comparing that to a quarter million dollar new build plane that has these unknowns around the cost of batteries over time, or the cost of the infrastructure to charge. The economics are really called into question, especially before you get to full scale. And I think that's, rightly should be acknowledged as one of the big risks for adoption. The performance of the systems, especially in training, I think a blended fleet where, cross country flights might have to be in a hybrid or combustion, but fully electric can be done for the, a few touch and goes here or there, or just familiarization. That's, I think that's completely reasonable to solve the problem. But the economics, especially in smaller airplanes, are pretty challenging. When you look at the economics as you scale to larger planes, it similarly, anywhere that it's not an operator of, high frequency becomes challenging because to earn back the capital cost of the system, you really need high utilization. And, you're not generally going against an option which is a premium priced combustion versus a premium priced electric. It's probably a relatively low cost combustion versus a premium priced electric, and I think that will be a friction point for adoption for those types of applications.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, if you were to argue for a fully battery electric aircraft, what is the right initial use case that will generate this flywheel moment where it makes sense and it also is a good path to get to scale, which will have benefits down the road with economies of scale and the supply chain, et cetera, et cetera. What use case gets the industry going, if not flight training.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think the use case that gets the electrification industry going is using those technologies in full scale applications. So it's taking the exact same batteries, the motors, the power electronics, These certification bases, taking those and by applying them into the hybrid electric applications, you build the industry base. You build the production volumes. You solve those economic challenges tied in with the supply chain and the certification and the market's readiness to adopt. Tying in with the economics of the full scope view, you start to bring those costs down to a point where all of a sudden those same technologies, those same suppliers that are making batteries for the hybrid or making motors for the hybrid, when the economics of scale get to a point, those same suppliers will be the supply base for the fully electric applications where, the opportunities are vast for, where you might want to fly a fully electric plane, whether it's short hop island hopping for commercial cargo flights, commercial drones, or for eVTOL cargo, or for pilot training. There are a lot of areas where you might want the fully electric. And I think the way to get the industry to scale is by scaling the underlying components rather than scaling the end solution of fully electric. And that's when I talk about hybrid as this gateway technology, I truly believe I'm helping all the electric, maybe even helping some hydrogen out there. Like because we're maturing the industry, we're maturing the supply base and we're getting up to good economics, full scale marketability of these underlying technologies that ultimately can be packaged in the fully electric. And that's I think that's how you get there. In eight and a half years of every waking and sleeping moment thinking about it, this is the pathway that makes sense to me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We just had Rob Britton on a couple weeks ago, our last podcast, and he was talking about regional air mobility, and he was saying that it's conceivable that hybrid or electric aircraft will allow us to be able to get to locations that today are less profitable than using a purely combustion engine aircraft. Talk a little bit about that. I'm guessing that hybrid would be the only solution today, although he did mention, I believe, guys, a 30 passenger electric plane as a potential solution in the near future. But talk about the capabilities for hybrid electric for regional air mobility. What's the near term, long term solution from your perspective, Kevin?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I really enjoyed listening to the episode with Rob and his enthusiasm for regional hybrid electric. You can hear it coming through in the conversation. Love it. And the folks over at Heart who you mentioned a few times, you know doing some really interesting work in trying to open up the regional space. Also in that episode, he had mentioned that this regional space is kind of eroded over the years. I mean, with deregulation and things having to compete just on the economics, economics really didn't make sense to serve a lot of secondary or tertiary markets. And so the service to those markets has gone away. And, that demand still exists, it's just being served by ground transportation, people jumping in their cars instead of flying. If you were able to give an economic alternative, lower cost of operation, being the key adoption driver, then people would potentially choose to fly those routes instead of drive those routes. And I think he was spot on with that and the enthusiasm around regional air mobility. Two areas that I would disagree with the approach, though. One is there's a phenomenal difference between a 19 passenger plane and a 20 passenger plane. While it might look almost the same, it is categorically different, in the literal sense of it, is a different category of airplane between Part 23 and Part 33. And the idea that somebody will open up regional air mobility with a Part 25 plane that is something over 20 passengers, I think, is faulty logic there. I don't think it's going to be, Part 25 is not going to be ready for hybrid electric, fully electric, any novel system for quite some time. Now, I want it to be there, and we're certainly helping the industry get there, and there are companies betting their, livelihood on it, but this is where I would disagree with the approach because we believe Part 23 is where it has to start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, explain for the audience the nuances of the differences.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So there are two major categories for conventional airplanes. One category, which is under Part 23 of the regulations, governs all planes up to 19 passengers or the equivalent weight. Part 25 governs all airplanes, 20 passengers and above. And so when regulations are updated in the industry, they're updated for one category or the other, eventually both. The smaller aircraft category, Part 23, is already positioned with all of the legislation and regulation in place to adopt novel propulsion technologies. The larger category is not in that state yet. It takes a decade of work to make a significant change to regulation in aviation. And I think we have years ahead of us before the large aircraft is ready to adopt novel propulsion technology from a regulatory standpoint. The technology might be there, but I think the regulations are going to lag in that case. So entering market with Part 23, or airplanes that are up to 19 passengers, I think is the fastest way, and frankly the only way we will see commercial adoption this decade. And that maybe in the next decade we'll see, through the proof points of these Part 23 smaller airplanes, we will see that technology leapfrog up into and enable the conversion of those certifications requirements in the larger Part 25 airplanes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Speaking of regional air mobility, wanted to get your thoughts on whether you think that electric aviation is what catalyzes regional air travel, or is there a, simply a thickness of the demand that's an issue that needs to be addressed somehow first. You know, we can take a brief look at history prior to the 1978 deregulation, point to point was the, airline network model, and regional travel was subsidized by the government mostly. Post deregulation, we saw the emergence of hub and spoke and a lot of regional routes were abandoned because they did not make economic sense anymore. So you can look at that to draw the conclusion that, well, actually the demand is there is just a matter of making that air travel economic. And so, that's an argument for the technology's role in disrupting, again, this, segment of the industry. If that's the case, well, first of all, do you think that's the case? And then second of all, do you think that electric aviation is the technology that will make economics appealing or you need to start layering additional things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I absolutely think, electrification is the pathway to making the economics make sense. And the improved economics drives this elasticity, this growth in the market. where we will see increased frequencies on the existing routes, decreased ticket costs as competition goes up on those, and increased accessibility or flights to fringe airports, either in a hub and spoke extension or a point to point model that, that allows more people to have access to air travel. I think adoption will also be driven by in similar economic driver but through cargo. I think the cargo market will be a rapid adopter of good economics and will be serving maybe even before the passengers choose to fly to these areas. Same day and next day delivery of packages is a growing expectation for our global economy and I think that what we'll see is as the economics improve the cargo operators, so, think your, your FedEx's, UPS's, DHL's, and similar around the world are going to be adopting these both to serve the high end communities who, want their Amazon packages in the next day, but also to open up these billion people markets that don't currently have access to the global economy efficiently, whether that's moving agricultural goods or other products, the economic drivers of increasing accessibility for them. So it's not just about U. S. states and cities. I do actually think on the global scale, these economics open up countries, entire regions of the world that are currently isolated from the global aviation ecosystem and economy. And when you look at that as a driver for scale, it's not about you know, 10 percent increase in the people who want to fly to Fresno. It's about a going from a market of zero to a market of again, hundreds of millions of people being served for the first time ever and what that drives. And so I wholeheartedly think that the economics of electrification is what gets us there. It is also on those principles that I think some of the exciting features aren't necessary to get us there. So vertical takeoff and landing, important in some areas, but probably not important for the vast majority. Fully electric and important and beneficial, but not useful if you can't land on that dirt strip in Kenya. Like, you have to have full flexibility, and this is part of the reason why I have such conviction around the regional air mobility being opened up through hybridization, where we don't have any of those infrastructure, range or operational limitations, but give that great economic benefit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Kevin, let's say we had a Part 23 aircraft and we wanted to be able to get more aircraft to cities that are not being well served today. And you're saying Part 23 was the way we'd have to do it today. What's the cost per available seat mile for a conventional aircraft, hybrid and electric? Assuming the three of them, could meet that capability today, what's the relative cost difference between the three?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the difference in CASM between conventional and hybrid, we're looking at really depends on, on exactly how you're operating the plane, right? So it's going to be a range. We're looking at a 20 to 40% savings on your cost per available seat mile. So think, again, depends on how you're flying the plane, going from a dollar per available seat mile down to, 70 cents or there's 60 some odd cents per available seat mile. that kind of a transition in certain cases. Electric's harder because right now when I run the numbers, depends on how you assume battery costs, because batteries are the big replacement cost there, but the, right now it does not in my mind, close economically to go fully electric. Also, it's hard to do the analysis because most of the routes you can't even operate. And then the question comes in on, do I count the grid infrastructure upgrade costs and capex and costs of that capital over time in the analysis, or do I not? So it gets a bit muddy. I don't have numbers specifically on the electric in isolation, for those reasons.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you talked to airlines, who today say those routes are not profitable because of the traditional aircraft? Have you talked to them about your operating costs? Are they saying, if you can get me a 30 to 35 percent reduction, that's a route that becomes profitable?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Yeah, the numbers I just talked about are from a very specific model with a very specific airline that I can't mention the names of, but yes, we get into the weeds with our customers and look at their actual operations, their actual frequencies, and how they actually fly the planes. And look at holistic costs, because it's not just about how many miles or hours you fly, it's about pilot costs, it's about outstation staffing, it's about infrastructure upgrades, and if you're serious about this, you need to look holistically at every, down to what is the interest rate on the loan that you take out in order to, or the financing that you get in order to buy the system in the first place. Like there are, all the holistic view on the economics, and making sure that is, economically positive for our customers is how we get through it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I really want to underline the holistic approach because I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. There's a lot of enthusiasm about quoting direct operating cost reductions with electrification, but if you look at it in the context of regional air mobility, where you're really competing with cars and rail and when you are accepting the fact that electric motors are not in their prime time to address this need today, and you start talking about, okay, well, what really do customers care about other than price? They care about frequency and the reliability of the schedule. And that means that you have to be able to, honor a, a service that will be available in all kinds of weather or most weather. So now you start talking about IFR capability and now you start introducing IFR reserves on top of an already small range budget. And it's only when you look at things holistically like that, do you really get a clear perspective on, okay, how really competitive is electric aviation in this particular use case today or over the next couple of years. And I think that, you know, there needs to be a little bit more realism.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I agree, because I think that realism is going to be what builds credibility. It's what enables adoption, it's what enables all of these other factors, many of which we haven't even touched on, whether it's the insurance companies or the lessors, we have to worry about residual values. the holistic view is the only way you actually get a full ecosystem to buy in. And, I just recently had a deep dive with one of our major customers, on IFR, speed, and Flight into Known Icing conditions, because these are the realities of their operation. And we need to know, hey, if we choose to fly five knots faster or five knots slower, what are the repercussions? If we are, like, flying, like, guaranteeing IFR, or if we are, if, what happens if you're not flight into known icing conditions? You're hardly useful, because it's not just Alaska where you have to deal with icing, right? It's everywhere that you have to be confident in your aircraft's ability to operate. Otherwise these mission critical operations have to ground the plane. And if you ground a plane in one of these operations, it destroys a whole network. It has a residual ripple effect through the operations, until recovered. So, so it's important to have these capabilities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So here's a thought, Kevin. What if after all is said and done, the, 30, 40, 50 percent improvement really becomes something more like 10 percent? I'm talking hypothetically here, right? At what point does it make more sense to incrementally improve the efficiency of a turboprop or a conventional aircraft that is certified, well known, all of those things, and perhaps kickstart the electrification supply chain on the unmanned side of things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It makes a lot of sense to, to find wherever you can build the efficiencies into the operation. from the airframe design, there's some folks out there who, with traditional engines, are looking at cutting 30 to 50 percent of the fuel burn out of your 7 37 class planes by bringing, blended wing body type airplanes to market. So there, there are ways that you can, by creating a new aircraft, even if you're not changing propulsion, you can get some meaningful efficiency gains as well. At the end of the day, when you achieve fewer economic benefits, it reduces the addressable market for the technology. So, or inverting that, for every percent cost that I save, it opens up more and more market opportunities. So, there's a old story in the industry about a major airline that removed a few pages from their in flight brochure to save a few pounds because that mattered, right? And these are fractions of a percent saving. So in your example of saving 10%, still transformative. For many operations. Now, is it going to be as transformative as saving 40? Nowhere close. Will it still be meaningful? Only if it's economically compelling. And so this is where you look at the conversion. You know, so maybe somebody struggles to retrofit their plane, but if you're buying a brand new plane and you get to choose between, CapEx neutral across the two, the combustion or a hybrid, and that hybrid saves 10 percent on your OpEx, you might still go with the hybrid system because economically that still makes sense. So this could be a factor that delays adoption if the economics don't work out. From an unmanned standpoint, we're already seeing from a drones, eVTOL, or like a Department of Defense type applications some fully electric, uh, or places where the economics don't matter as much, where you know, they're willing to pay a premium for the mission capability. Those are certainly additional early adopter areas where I think, the industry is likely to get a boost, regardless of the fuel savings, a boost in market applicability because of the performance characteristics of these new vehicle types.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is the drone propulsion supply chain overlapping into the propulsion supply chain that you deal with?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, a year and a half ago, we acquired a company's assets, called, the company was named Talyn and Talyn was developing a, effectively a cargo lift drone, and various types of payloads that it could carry. Our propulsion systems fit straight into that cargo drone, straight into traditional, conventional takeoff and landing drones, or eVTOL, for a whole variety of applications. Ampaire's focus is, again, the disagreement place number one. Propulsion is where you begin, and I want to put propulsion across everything. And, yeah, so the same engine types, I mean, there are flavors and variations of engines, but, the major families are applicable across. across the industry, whether it's manned or unmanned.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, tell us a little bit about Ampaire. How do you make money today? How do you make money in five years and 10 years? What's your special sweet spot?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Ampaire is focused on the electrification of aviation, focused on propulsion, specifically hybrid electric propulsion, upgrading existing aircraft types as an entry point into market and using that as a gateway to transition the industry toward lower carbon and better economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Give examples of the type of aircraft that you're converting. I saw a Skymaster as\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>so back in 2019, we flew our very first aircraft type, which is a upgraded Cessna Skymaster push pull configuration. We call that an independent parallel hybrid architecture, where you have one combustion engine, one fully electric. We've also flown the Cessna Grand Caravan, which is with an integrated parallel hybrid architecture that uses a, mechanically coupled electric and combustion set of engines to be a hybrid electric aircraft. That same engine that goes into the Caravan is what we just finished our CDR on the King Air for integrating there. We've got the Twin Otter is a 19 passenger plane in the same category. And there are thousands of planes in market that use this category of engine. So this is our half megawatt class system. We also have a quarter megawatt class system, which is used as a, either a genset or propulsion system for general aviation, drones, and eVTOLs. Now, as a company where we're focused is around the certification of that launch product and the Caravan. The market that adopts that is both passenger carrying and cargo carrying for the commercial industry, but then also we've got a number of contracts with the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Energy. So our money today, our revenue, which is really just offsetting NRE costs, or non recurring engineering costs. We've brought in about 25 million of government contracts. For these, through these government customers, for the development of our propulsion system and the application of that system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're making$500 million in 5 years, who are your primary customers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we scale commercial revenue, this comes from the regional aviation market. These are folks who are currently buying turboprop engines and would instead of overhauling their engine or buying a new engine, would be buying one of Ampaire's hybrid electric amp drives. These amp drives are the ones which save 50 percent fuel burn, and we believe will save on maintenance cost as well. So it'll be good economics for people to switch over to our systems rather than run on their traditional combustion system, and this is where we see the earliest adoption for technology. So begins as retrofits of the existing fleet of turboprops, but then quickly moves into partnering with OEMs, the aircraft manufacturers, for when they build a new airplane, giving it a hybrid option. The next phase is, of course, working on clean sheet design planes with OEMs who are optimizing planes, new designs, around the novel propulsion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Tell us a little bit about your, you have a great history of being an innovator and entrepreneur. Give us some lessons learned to our innovators who are listening today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, it's been eight and a half years at Ampaire. The number one and biggest recommendation I can give is choose something that you deeply love and that you think you can actually achieve. The days get challenging over the course of years as an entrepreneur. It is not easy. It is oftentimes not even fun. But when you know that you're doing the right thing, when you're tackling the most meaningful, challenging, visible problems that you possibly can, it gives the motivation, not just for you as an individual innovator, but truly, these are things done by teams. And when you have meaningful work, and you're thoughtful about it, it enables you to pull together teams of really great people to go do these audacious things. I think the importance of setting tangible and tractable goals that you can actually achieve in the near term is very important. It's not just about moonshots, it's about the steps on how to get there. And, and ultimately, it's about building long standing relationships and not looking for what do I get now or, being short sighted in them, because truly the world is built by people and, and supported by relationships that are built over years or decades. And so, being a good actor in the industry is so important.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, you've acquired companies, you were almost acquired yourself. What advice would you have for people who might be going through a similar process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so always be open to opportunity and thoughtfully assess it. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the opportunity to go public via SPAC was pretty exciting, and there was a whole lot of money on the table, both from company valuations and from operating budgets. But you also have to be willing to change course when it's clear that the course you're on is not the right one, which we did in early 2022. Ampaire pulled out of a deal to go public because we realized that it was, the higher risk path and it was not worth, continuing down that path of going public and getting acquired. These are hard decisions that you need clarity, you need good advisors and mentors to support you on, and ultimately you need to set the ego aside a lot of times and go on good first principles when making your decisions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, thanks a lot.

You don't have to worry about passenger egress necessarily, or passenger comforts that don't necessarily play a role in the cargo market. If I was to focus on one area, I'd say that's where the most significant gain for us will be, is products that are really designed around our needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>2:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Welcome back to The Vertical Space, we hope everyone is enjoying their summer, and welcome to our conversation with Jeff Luckett, President and one of the founding members of UPS Flight Forward, a wholly owned UPS Subsidiary. Since our beginning back in 21, we've had a lot of OEMs and providers of services on the podcast, both in advanced air mobility as well as in more traditional aviation. It's always special to hear from people like Jeff and the organizations they represent the buyers and recipients of the value of these organizations making products and services. At the end of the day, it's organizations like UPS who are driving the demand. It's their use cases, their business challenges and opportunities and their cash that drives the funding and building of these vehicles and services. And with UPS, we're talking to one of the trailblazers and leaders and with Jeff, we're talking to their leader as the President of UPS Flight Forward. So listen to this. Jeff talks about evaluating over 850 different companies to determine those who could best meet UPS', challenges and opportunities. So, I bet you want to hear about how he differentiated those who made the cut and those who didn't and what advice he would give to those companies. A consistent theme throughout our discussion are the requirements of cargo centric operations. And the importance of listening to these unique requirements when marketing to organizations like UPS. Jeff believes and he is in the company of many that it's the cargo market that is more likely to more substantially materialize in the early years versus the passenger taxi markets. Jeff starts off discussing what happens on the ground is as important as what's going on in the air. And when you think about the UPS mission, and after listening to Jeff's explanation, you'll have a better understanding as to why. Listen to when Jeff sees his future state aircraft entering service and when he expects them to scale. An important consideration, Jeff discusses why UPS decides to insource and outsource its operations key to understanding some of the roles of future advanced air mobility operations. I like how Jeff describes UPS's role and appetite to invest in integrating aircraft into the NAS and his response draws upon the successful role UPS played with the introduction of ADS-B. So many thanks to Jeff for joining us and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Jeff Luckett as you innovate profitably and The Vertical Space. Jeff Luckett is President and one of the founding members of UPS Flight Forward, a wholly-owned UPS subsidiary incorporated on June 14, 20 19 established to work with regulators and OEMs to move the UAS advanced air mobility industry forward. On September 27th, 2019, UPS Flight Forward became the first company to receive a standard 1 35 air carrier certificate, approved by the FAA for UAS operations and has continued to be an industry leader, accomplishing many of the industry firsts occurring in the US, including the first Part 1 35 UAS revenue delivery in 2019 and the first Part 1 35 UAS revenue BVLOS delivery in 2023. Jeff's responsibilities also include oversight of the UPS Airline Technology Support Group. Prior to his current leadership roles, Jeff's 34 plus year career at UPS has covered several areas, including UPS Airline Flight Operations, Engineering, Network Planning, Long Range Planning and Aircraft Acquisitions. Jeff has also held supporting roles with the UPS Airline Emergency Response Team, DOD CRAF Program and Humanitarian Air Relief Charters. Jeff graduated from University of Louisville and has an MBA in Aviation from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He also served two tours of duty in the U S Navy during the first Gulf War. Jeff, welcome to The Vertical Space. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Great to be on with you all today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes, there's a couple things I could highlight. First, I would say we entered the space and we're really interacting primarily, initially, on the small UAS side, and we believed all along that the lessons that we learn in the small UAS space would apply and help inform, the shift to larger AAM solutions, and we're seeing that, but that was some resistance, I think, we felt early on. The other thing I would highlight is that we believe that the importance of what happens from touchdown to takeoff, is as critically important as what happens in the air for us with the solutions being developed. We're seeing a lot of technology companies develop great solutions that do incredible things in the air, autonomously and sustainable, but it's the solutions that also have to take place for the ground, For it to make sense for us and to be economically viable.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Thanks. Jeff. Talk about smaller UAS and why that was your focus.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So our initial pass at small UAS was kind of dictated by guidelines. So, under 55 pounds was really that initial focus. And we looked at aircraft that fell under that FAA limit at the time and that still had a meaningful payload and range for us. So, really when we think small UAS, it's things for more final mile campus delivery type solutions in a reasonably small geographic area.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I would probably say many listening would be a little bit surprised that UPS, that was the focus because you've created so much noise in the larger spectrum. And then what you're saying is the ground operation is as almost important as the air. Talk about that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Okay. and just the, I guess to go back to the previous question, small UAS was what we were able to do first. there are still no AAM solutions type certified. So it wasn't that we weren't looking at them, but it was a matter of what we had available to us to use. But as we jumped in and started going after those small UAS operations we had to form partnerships and, get that kicked off, but we worked with Matternet on that initial, small UAS, stand up. And that was how we went about getting our Part 135 certificate partnered with Matternet. And that is still our only aircraft on our certificate.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Matternet we've had them on the podcast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Excellent.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So talk about the ground operations. One thing you're doing different is the on to in, the out to off is an area that you're focused on and for some they'll understand why, but talk about that briefly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Sure. So when we look at our current day operations, they're still very labor intensive. And when I say that, we do have the ability to do BVLOS now, but even with that unlock, we have crew members at the ends of each route. The Matternet, as we use it today, requires us to load and unload the aircraft, do pre flight, post flight type inspections, and, reload, batteries for flight. So with all those things in mind, it's still a very labor intensive operation. So we want to see things progress in the industry that allow lighter lift on the ends of the route. And we know Matternet's working on solutions today, and in their Swiss operation, they've got a station that the aircraft interacts with, and that's, moving the direction we're thinking. But, in general, we just need to see the ability to automate more of the process on the ground.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Thank you, Jeff. What are the origins of the mission of UPS Flight Forward? How did it come about and why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Our origins really, we've been an airline now for quite some time, a 121 airline. And as the company leadership started to acknowledge that things are changing and that there's new technologies coming to this industry, that was recognized and a small team was asked to tackle this new frontier, if you will. So UPS Flight Forward was pulled together from a small group of subject matter experts from our 121 Airline. We initially stood up operations, from a part 107 perspective. We pursued our Part 135 certificate and formed a new company, a wholly owned UPS subsidiary. And as all that came together, I would say part of the origin was from an ask from the FAA. The FAA asked us to participate, and we joined the, IPP program in North Carolina as that avenue to help us, integrate into this new space. So, partly an FAA ask and partly leadership acknowledging these new technologies coming to the market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Jeff, as you looked at this new technology to solve some of the problems that UPS is facing, can you talk about what those main pain points are that UPS was trying to solve with this new generation of aviation.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, when we look at current day operations, we're challenged with aging aircraft, pilot shortages, which some will debate that topic. Even our own 121 Airline, they've got a line of pilots out the door. But when you look at feeder aircraft operations, part 135 operations, they're challenged every day because as people get their hours, they're moving on, up into, to 121 operations. So we still see that as a problem. And in fact, COVID amplified it because we saw furloughs happen during that time. It delayed training and set back the industry in some ways, and it's still catching up. there were people that chose not to enter that field during COVID because of the scale back, and I don't think we've caught up as an industry. So, the pilot shortages is a key piece, and then just cost in general. What we're seeing is year over year costs increasing fairly significantly, for our small feeder aircraft operations. So these solutions bring new things to the table that can help offset those costs. And we know we're going to have to address some of the aging aircraft, as it stands today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And the impact of the pilot shortage is that more stuff is being moved in the ground or what's the impact of this?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Part of it's cost. I mean, I'd say the biggest driver there is cost, because you're having to pay more to keep people in seats, rather than them progressing onto the 121 space. So, cost is a big piece. we are having, in some cases, we do look at ground as an alternative, but we're a time definite business. So when our next day product arrives at a jet gateway out in our system, if it can't make it on the ground in time, that's where we leverage that feeder aircraft network and it's how we maintain that service to our customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The feeder part of that chain of moving cargo is where most of the problem is today. Is that correct?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we look at the solutions that are coming to market and things we're trying to solve for, I'd say that is the biggest problem that we're looking at today, yes. There's also another angle that we're digging into, and that's new revenue opportunities. One of the challenges that we will have as an industry is paying for the new tech. And if we're just putting it in as a plug and play, to existing operations, that may not be all we need, because our current utilization, these aircraft are based around one rotation a night for our next day product. And that may not support, the cost requirement for these new aircraft. So we're looking at ways to leverage these new technologies and new fleets of aircraft to support new revenue opportunities and potentially offset costs elsewhere.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And just to paint a more vivid picture of how urgent these problems need to be solved, or at least what's the perception at UPS, on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the urgency to introduce these new technologies to solve some of the problems that you're talking about?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Great question. It depends on who you talk to. Within our organization, we're a company of 500, 000 employees and a global footprint. We service 200 countries. So, the feeder aircraft piece of the equation is small in the grand scheme, but it is important. we currently vendor out our aircraft. So, we're relying on that vendor fleet, to support our current feeder aircraft needs. And what we're seeing in that market space is consolidation of both operators, as well as some of the aircraft leaving the market. And I think that's becoming a driver. So we need a solution. And again, if you talk to airline staff that are familiar with our feeder aircraft network, I'd say it's going to fall on the higher end of the importance and then, those that are dealing with the ground volume, probably won't see it as big of a priority, but, again, we're a large organization and I think it's relevant, which party you're talking to and understanding, the needs to make service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If the business justification for the feeder network is the priority, and we talk about the small UAS to start and then larger vehicles afterwards what are the 2 or 3 areas of the next 3 to 5 years where you're saying we're going to get the greatest financial return, and from what vehicles and what would the return be?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The first bet we've placed is on Beta. We were interested in engaging in the eVTOL Space, and when we look at the aircraft available in the market that are coming to market. We needed something that could hit our mission requirements, and our contract was based on 250 miles of range, a good payload and a volume that was meaningful to us. We know we may not hit all those targets, with the first delivered version of the aircraft. Battery energy density is changing and improving year over year. But what we do know is that from a volume standpoint, the aircraft can hit some of the marks that we need on the lower end of our feeder aircraft spectrum. And what that does for us is in today's world, I mentioned if we fly our next day volume, if it comes through our hub and leaves here on a jet, those jets land at regional airports servicing cities, and once those land, if we can ground the volume on time to its destination, that's what we do. That's typically the cheapest way to handle it. But if you can't, and you have to put that volume on a feeder aircraft, that aircraft is going to fly from that jet gateway to a GA airport in a smaller, super rural town. When it lands, there's going to be a vehicle meet that aircraft, they're going to hand off load the aircraft onto a vehicle, and it's going to drive to one of our centers. And at that center, the volume would be sorted down to the package cars for delivery. In future state, what we would do is take an eVTOL directly from that aircraft arrival, and fly to the center where the volume needs to go. So we take a ground segment out of the mix and reduce the handles of the packages, which we see as a financial benefit on both. And a potential time savings for the network. When we look at other solutions, so we are looking at, retrofitting existing aircraft as well, so there are a lot of missions that we're not going to cover with an eVTOL in today's world, just because of the amount of volume, the payloads required, and the ranges. So for those solutions, retrofitted aircraft may be a great way for us to move forward. And as you look at the industry landscape, many are focused on the Cessna Caravan, and that's a workhorse of our feeder aircraft network. It is still in production, which makes it even more attractive. And there's solutions that are going to help advance both autonomy capabilities for those aircraft and sustainable power plants. So we think, really, there's a great opportunity for savings there and efficiency. When you look at the cost of operating feeder aircraft, and I'm going to generalize this very high level so, those in the industry can dig into the numbers. They may see something slightly different, but high level, if you take the variable costs that we deal with daily and bucket those, you can roughly, create buckets that tie 20 percent to crew, 20 percent to maintenance, and 20 percent of fuel. And that 60%, roughly, of the grand total, are numbers that we can influence with some of these new technologies. So I think that's really a focal point for us when we look at those retrofitted aircraft, taking advantage of something that already exists. But making it better and more efficient. So those are, when we look at eVTOLs and then traditional aircraft, I think that's the two approaches that you'll see us focus on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>19:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Okay, Jeff. And when you look across these different types of aircraft, given how you're going to employ them in your operations, which, what I interpret as, improving the end quality of service, increasing efficiency and saving cost, looking at the different aircraft, what is the early end of the time window when those aircraft will actually deliver the bottom line savings, given their own evolution and scale up and the refinement of their operations? And then what are the other aircraft that are at the outer end of that timeline and how far out is that when those things are going to be delivering these savings for your use case.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So when we look at the industry landscape today, everything's going to be predicated on type certification. When will the FAA approve these solutions? Clean sheet aircraft, in general, I would, will expect to take longer. We've been partnered now with Beta since, 2019 ish timeframe. So, that aircraft is evolving, the production line is there, and they're going to start pushing aircraft out the end, by the end of this year. So, those are happening, but you still have to get through that type certification process. When we look at the retrofit side, those aircraft exist and they're basically going after STCs. So, at least to scale, I think that some of the STCs may move faster than clean sheet aircraft just because more of the aircraft's already accepted, but we hope that they run in parallel. I think you've probably heard about Innovate28 and some of those initiatives to get aircraft moving, in that time horizon with the FAA. And, for me, the 2026 to 2028 time frame is when we expect to see these aircraft entering service and, starting to do meaningful routes in the network and then scaling up from there. So, I don't know if that helps give you the color you're looking for.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>21:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It does. It helps me sort of think about the company's time horizon, in terms of your expectations. And can you walk us through when you decided to embark on this, how you thought about, hey, let's lean in and be an early adopter of this and, in a way, pioneer the operations versus, I'm sure there's another school of thought, in the space that says, hey, why don't we wait until, these are a little more scaled up. We can wait until 2030 or whatever and, and then adopt. How did you guys work through those set of considerations and come to the conclusion to say, all right, we want to lean in?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>22:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>From UPS's standpoint, this was a clear opportunity for us to take advantage of an invitation from the FAA to participate. And then as we did, we acknowledged that there were several benefits. One, we could set the safety bar. and we've done some of that as we've proceeded with our operations. We're the first carrier to have an FAA accepted, SMS program. So, that was a big step for us and we're working through our ASAP program as we speak. So working with the FAA to know that as these new technologies come to market, they're being done safely. And for us, it's protecting our 121 operation as well. We've got, one of the largest jet air fleets in the world. and when we think about those operations, we want to know that the new technologies coming aren't going to put those at risk. So we kind of wear two hats in that sense. So we've been able to participate in the rulemaking and establishing what safe and good operations look like from the beginning. So I think that's a big piece of it. And then the other significant item is, as we've looked at all the companies out there building these new solutions and creating new opportunities, we're able to inform those products. And we want to inform them from a cargo operator's perspective. the initial eVTOLs were all built around air taxi use cases. And for us, a lot of those cabins don't conform well for package. So for us, being able to, on the front end of solutions being developed to influence those OEMs, to create products that are meaningful to us, I would say is the other big element to the equation.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>23:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, it sounds like your desire is to take some of these advanced aircraft, electric aircraft, and replace some of the feeder routes with it. And, altogether, bypass some of the ground legs in the process. Have you explored the idea of just, changing the paradigm of how cargo is moved, in terms of breaking up a single load that a Caravan might fly into multiple drones and somehow redefine and reimagine the network themselves as opposed to taking a new technology and plugging it into an existing framework.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's a great thought and we have done that work. We've got an operations research team that has helped us develop modeling and simulation efforts and in that process what we're able to do is plug in aircraft specifications, capabilities and cost. And run models that compare the different solutions. So we have undertaken some of those efforts and in some cases, it will choose to replace a larger aircraft with multiple smaller craft and take more volume direct to a specific destination rather than consolidating in some cases. So, yes, I would say that is an opportunity and we continue to evaluate it. I would say. Entry into service, though, will look probably a lot more like plug and play on an existing route, until we get to some sense of scale, and then reimagining the network becomes a bigger opportunity at that point, once, once we're able to scale some of these technologies.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what are the driving factors that would influence that decision in your modeling and analysis?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We're a time definite service, so we have to know that the solutions are going to meet the time requirements, involved, and then I would say cost is going to be one of the most primary considerations. Anything that we do that's new has to show some return on investment, cost savings or new revenue generation. So I think that's where this is going to become extremely important as well. It's one thing to reduce our carbon footprint, for example, with a sustainable power plant, but if it does so at a higher cost, we've got to weigh that into the equation. So, we're looking at it from all angles, and cost will be a driver, safety will be a primary consideration, and then time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, let's say we, we go to your whiteboard. And on the left side of the whiteboard are the use cases, the business justification and the use cases for where UPS needs enhanced capabilities. On the right hand side are the, it sounds like 850 different companies that you've evaluated to fit those near term, perhaps long term use cases. How many of the 850 we're almost perfectly situated for the use cases you've identified.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>it's a pretty small number. I think that, again, the focus of some of the industry's been on things that aren't in our plans necessarily. So, again, getting people to think about cargo versus air taxi, that was a big issue for us to find solutions that work. What we are seeing and I think becomes extremely important, there are companies that are focused on cargo centric aircraft. And in my career, I've spent time in our aircraft acquisitions division of UPS multiple times. And that's where we evaluate what fits the network need for the air solution part of our network. And there's limited options there. Most of the conversations are with your Boeings and Airbuses of the world. And, they've got a product offering and you're typically, in the past, we've competed those two brands and found the solution that meets the need. But almost in all cases, and when you look at the history of the cargo market, we were getting aircraft that were originally designed for passengers. And for those companies, typically a new production line is based on passenger need first. And then cargo is an afterthought. In many cases, early days, it was all retrofitted aircraft, converted aircraft for freighters. They did start building production freighters with the introduction of some of our early fleet. The 757s was an example of, us entering the market with new, mission built freighters, if you will. But they were born out of a passenger aircraft. So when I look at solutions that come across our inbound. When someone is very keen to think about a product that's centered around the cargo mission, it gets really interesting because you get to take advantage of efficiencies that weren't planned in the original aircraft. You don't have to worry about passenger egress necessarily, or passenger comforts that, don't necessarily play a role in the, the cargo market. If I was to focus on one area, I'd say that's where the most significant gain for us will be is products that are really designed around our needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As you evaluated the 850 and you said there were very few that were cargo centric. Did you go to any of the, let's call them the, the non cargo OEMs, have you made recommendations to them on changes that they should be making, and have any of them changed their ways to adapt to your requirements?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In most cases, I would say the majority of the market has been very receptive to our feedback, and I think that's one of the value ads we bring to the industry. If you talk to people that have met with us, I think they'll tell you we've given them very direct, clear feedback about what's important to us. And it may not align with their core mission. So, and we're okay with that. people are designing aircraft for different reasons and different needs. The air taxis of the world, most of them were already far enough down a path that type certifying their first aircraft isn't going to pivot easily to cargo, version. So it's not that they haven't taken the feedback. But I would say that, there's limited opportunity to adjust aircraft that were already started down that pipeline, where I think there's a huge opportunity is the second generation of these new aircraft. I think people will think about them differently and, we'll see them scale up in size to meet more of a cargo configuration and even larger passenger, consideration. There was one thing I was going to bring up on this topic, though, when you think about the aircraft and what they're capable of, one of the challenges I think that the air taxis are going to see, and we've heard voiced already, is they've built them around the passenger load, but in many cases, they can't accommodate baggage. That's becoming a, I think, a consideration that the amount of baggage that someone will be able to take on an air taxi to get to that mainstream airport. may not align with what they would want to or can bring when they actually get on the jet. So I think that's one of the issues that market will have to address, as they move forward so that, the solution actually makes sense for the customer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Earlier, you mentioned, utilization of the feeder aircraft. Can you talk a little bit about what utilization you expect from this next generation of vehicles and how big of a risk is that in your overall business case?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So right now, our feeder aircraft network, as I mentioned, it's very tightly tied to our next day air network, and when those aircraft land at those regional gateways, that's when we use those feeder aircraft. They do a rotation out. And back. And that one rotation is going to be a challenge to pay for. So, that's where we start looking at how would we utilize these aircraft potentially different. And as the new technologies come in, these advanced air mobility aircraft, they'll start out crewed in most cases. we do know there's a couple OEMs out there that want to start with autonomy capable or remotely piloted aircraft. But in general, they'll start out crewed. But as we do transition to aircraft with capabilities of remote piloting, now you don't lock the asset, or landlock it, I should say, at an airport while the crew's in rest. And that's where I think it can get really interesting for the industry, because, when our CEO looks at things that our company does, one of the terms Carol will say, or phrases she'll use with us, is sweat the asset. And when you buy these, high price, new technology things, you want to be able to use them and make good use of them. So I think that's where we'll look for new use cases. And one of our core principle areas that we're focusing on here at UPS is healthcare. So if we move our normal rotation for the next day volume, and then we have this asset, can we onboard new healthcare revenue for other purposes, time definite goods, but that may not fit into our existing network today. There's also other opportunities. When we look at, especially eVTOLs, and you look at the coastal areas of the U. S. and island chains or geographically challenged areas, it creates new opportunities to connect those communities that otherwise are a much longer ground or even ferry included transit. So I think there's different ways that we can support other business and revenue cases with some of these technologies.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>J Jeff, did UPS ever consider the use of helicopters for any of these routes or operations in its network? And as you look at eVTOLs to fill this type of a role, is it their reduced operating cost that you anticipate is going to be the lever?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes. So UPS has looked at helicopters in the past. And the prime example I'll use is when our jets arrive in Newark, those aircraft land in today's world, we offload that volume into trucks, and those trucks contend with bridges, tunnels, and traffic to get into the city. In future state, what we would like to do is take an eVTOL from the jet aircraft arrival, and eventually go directly to the roof of the 43rd Street Hub in Manhattan and get that early am custom critical healthcare type volume directly there to the sort facility. We know that's not going to happen right away and there'll be step functions. In today's environment, we know that we're having to look at other solutions like barging some of the volume across to make time and that's not necessarily attractive when you're looking at those early am custom critical type deliveries that we need to get out early in the morning. So, that is a big opportunity for us with those eVTOLs to exercise that capability. That is one of the use cases that we've looked at helicopters for in the past, and the operating expense just doesn't justify. One of the step functions I think we'll see happen though is the Stockyards VertiPort for example. I think people will look to leverage those type sites to get to the city until we graduate further down the road to actually landing on structures again in Manhattan.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>35:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, many of the OEMs or startups that are producing these vehicles reason at this point in time that they want to be the operator. How does UPS think about working with companies that are at that stage? Can that be a fit, or is that not?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>35:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So for our Part 135 operations that I think all these advanced mobility solutions would fall into, we're open to both. We're open to partnering with people that are operators and OEMs. We're also interested in onboarding technologies to our certificate. So I think we can go either path. Our current feeder aircraft fleet is all vendored out. We've got a pool of vendors that have aircraft that we source from. And what we've done in the advanced air mobility space right now is we've tried to, in some ways, play matchmaker. We'll look at vendors that operate for us and new technologies and start to create interest there for onboarding some of the new technologies to their fleets. But we've got very little control over that. And so for us, I think we want to go down both paths. We want to encourage operators to look at new technologies while at the same time. us participate in bringing those to market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the healthcare market that you see yourselves going into, and how much of it was driven based on the capabilities of the vehicles that you're talking about?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So UPS is very focused on the healthcare market in general. We've got a whole division of the company that's very focused on healthcare solutions. And for us, we want to be another item on the menu for those healthcare customers where we can provide a service that may not be capable any other way. A lot of these products are time definite. We looked at solutions in the very beginning, that we actually do today in some ways. So, hospital campuses, for example, when you look at small UAS, we've got the opportunity to expedite service for those patients, whether it's their lab samples getting from a clinic to the main hospital lab and being processed in time, that the doctor can diagnose before they leave. I mean, that's a change. We also have done roles where medications are formulated and under hoods and very sterile environments in labs, and then they have to get from there to the clinic. And we've also expedited those movements of those specialty medications for patients using drones. So those are a couple examples of things that we actually do today. As you, you scale up from small UAS, we think there's going to be room for those medium size vehicles to come into play and help balance loads and networks for these health care providers. Stock rotation and expediting those is critically important. These are expensive goods and, as they start to reach maturity, and have to be cycled out, I think that's a way that we can help support some of these customers and providers by expediting those movements\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What is the reason that part 121 owns the jets and the part 135 operation being vendored out and how does that impact your thinking whether to outsource or bring in house some of these AAM vehicles.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we look at our 121 operations, those are very stable operations, meaning the locations we fly to, those don't come and go and ebb and flow that drastically. We see growth. But when we assign a jet to a route in a market, it's meeting a particular demand level and that we see, some pretty significant consistency there. Not that the network doesn't change over time. Our jet fleet is made up of different aircraft types that we can gauge up and down. But when we look at feeder aircraft markets, those are more likely to ebb and flow. During COVID, we saw a flex up. The demand was higher in some of these smaller markets for goods, to be flown, as we saw COVID wrap up, some of that demand subsided. So we can't adjust, as quickly if you own the assets and deploy them. With vendored operations, those are contract driven and we've got the flexibility to increase capacity very quickly or draw back if necessary. And with a pool of providers that, allows a lot of flexibility. So that's kind of why we've gone down that path. The future could look different. And as we look at the mature markets for feeder aircraft that have some consistency, those may be areas that we choose to operate ourselves, but we're open to exploring both paths. And I think it'll be a financial decision in the end, what's more attractive for us to pursue and what solution fits the needs. And you bring in remotely piloted operations, I think that will be a, a differentiator. if you own the asset and you're running a remote operation center that's just staffed, you have the opportunity to keep those assets moving, more of the day at a lower overhead cost than just, another contract for another route. So, I think as these scale up, there is an opportunity to look at the cost differently, with own versus vendored operations.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the common things that we hear when we're talking to entrepreneurs that are, pitching large logistics players like UPS on cargo drones of various sizes, is that, those logistics giants don't really want to engage until there is end to end readiness in the chain. Not quite interested in exploring a few routes here and there. The message appears to be, okay, well, sounds interesting, but come back when we can rely on this a hundred percent and when there's ways that we can plug it in seamlessly and integrate into the existing workflows.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so for these solutions to really make sense into our networks, they're going to have to be reliable. They're going to have to solve for the mission set that we see today. So reliability will come with, weather capabilities. These aircraft are going to have to be able to fly in the same conditions that traditional feeder aircraft fly in today to service our mission. Our customers won't be happy if there are certain days that we can't service their volume. Obviously, in today's world, there are limitations to existing aircraft, including our jet fleets, and that's kind of understood, but if you create new limitations based on a new aircraft entering service, I don't think that's going to go well. So we, we need these solutions that come mature to the market with the capability of operating in wind and, precip conditions that existing aircraft handle today. And when we think about integrating these new technologies into our network, I mentioned once already that, for us, there's a huge importance on what happens from touchdown to takeoff. It's that window of time that we need to have clear understanding of what's required to make the operation successful. If it's an electric aircraft, that's going to include charging infrastructure, regardless of what type of aircraft, you're going to have to know that plan for fueling it and keeping the aircraft moving. How we interact with the aircraft is another big question. If it's an autonomous, capable, or autonomy related aircraft that's remotely piloted, how does the ground crew know when to approach the aircraft? What functions are performed by the ground crew versus someone remote? And, you think about things as simple as, approaching the aircraft to chock it, opening the aircraft, and then once you've unloaded the aircraft, on the other end, who preflights it? How do you weight and balance the aircraft? How do you ensure that it's conformed with that weight and balance plan? There's a lot of considerations that I think as we want to integrate these new technologies into the network, we've got to be very thoughtful about what happens on the ground. I don't know if that kind of covers what you're looking for there, but that's a huge importance to us.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you come forward to certain OEMs and say, Hey, these are our requirements.

We've not gone out to your typical, new entrant OEMs and posed those type questions, but the long term players in the market, we've shared those views with. So yes, we have on the front end talked about what product needs look like for us. And I guess, big picture, we do have established standards that, if we're wanting to tackle the feeder aircraft use case, for example, we do have standards that we will share with those that we meet with about what good looks like. So, it's not just about adapting their current product, but we'll tell them what we're looking for. So, in some cases, as I mentioned, it may not impact their current product offering that they're trying to type certify, but it helps them inform that future aircraft that they have on the drawing board.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, if you're going to scale operations with advanced air mobility vehicles by 2030, do you think you've already talked to the OEMs who are going to be part of that scaling process?

What else would you want to tell them to be able to meet the requirements of UPS so that you can scale by 2030, 2035?

And for us, this will be more specific to UPS, when we look at our air network, we are typically volume limited and not payload limited. On our typical fleet, that's what we see come out. And that being said, a lot of the aircraft being built are very sleek and aerodynamic, which is great, but they don't conform to the large volumetric needs that we need. So I think as products come to market, that volume consideration is just as important as payload and range can be, because if you can't contain the volume, the solution may not be an option to even consider.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What else would you tell them?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Focusing on that reliability piece and knowing that what they're bringing to market can meet the same or better reliability standards that we have today, and that safety is also of paramount importance. We want to see this industry successful. And we don't want to see it hit hurdles unintendedly because, corners are cut or safety isn't a priority. So for us, that's one of the most important things. And there's the aircraft side of it, but there's also, some of the infrastructure pieces and whether it's the ground support needs for the fuel or whether it's UTM and the requirements to integrate into the airspace. I think those are all important. So, depending on the vendor type, we're expressing those interests, relevant to the solutions that are being created.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Jeff, I would imagine that some of the military logistics missions whose requirements are being scoped out and that are being developed for by companies might also serve the mission profile that you describe. Are you seeing a good fit there and do you see a path where the technology is going to mature in the military domain area and fit right into what you guys want to do with it?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We do see some parallels, and I'm excited about those. The challenge for us is that, the military variant aircraft won't have to hit the same type certification requirements that commercial aircraft will. So the paths do look different, but I think the work that's being done with the DoD is extremely important because we've seen a couple of things happen in the industry. We've seen VC money dry up and challenge that vendor pool. We've seen consolidation as a result, and a lot of the efforts going on with DoD projects are a way to fund the industry forward. And I think, of significant importance to them because they have ways to bring new capabilities to the battlefield and support missions differently, and in some cases without putting as many people in harm's way. And for us, I think that's proving grounds that will help create scalable solutions, for the commercial market. So I think there's great benefit there. It's still early. We're very familiar with our partner, Beta, on some of the work they've already done with the military, and I think it's, it will pay dividends, I think, not just for Beta, but others that are participating, because I think it will help fund the progress of their product, and, they're able to do real world use cases ahead of the commercial market. We can participate in proof of concept operations, but they're very limited. The military can put aircraft through their paces and in real world situation, more readily available. it doesn't require all the same.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, that's true. And they can operate them in very different ways than you have to operate in the National Airspace System. When you guys think about flying relatively large autonomous aircraft in the NAS, what are your assumptions around that operation? I mean, I assume it's going to be above 500 feet AGL and so it's going to be interacting with other air traffic. Is this going to be a remotely piloted operation or is it going to be some other level of autonomous flight? How are you guys mapping that out and what are your expectations for what that's going to look like in the coming years?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Sure. So the small UAS operations that we have, current day and expectations moving forward will still be limited to keep those below 400 feet. But when we look at the advanced air mobility solutions that meet our feeder aircraft needs, those do enter that traditionally, crewed aircraft space. We think that the solutions we will start to introduce in many cases, they're going to start crewed and be seamless to ATC as it stands today and other crews in the airspace. We've already see that play out with multiple vendors in proof of concept operations where ATC nor other pilots in the airspace really acknowledge or know the difference between that aircraft in operation versus anything else. And I think that's the goal is a seamless integration. I think there's great promise in what UTM solutions can bring to the table. And, potentially helping bridge the gap between current ATC and what the future could look like. The early state, the goal is to be irrelevant. I've heard, Jeffrey Vincent talk about it, and, he's leading that UAS effort with the FAA and boring is good. When they think about operations in the air, they don't want it to be unique and different. I think they're looking for solutions to fit the mold current day. And then. help evolve what the system in the future actually looks like as you digitize more of the information.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think we have a pretty clear path emerging for what autonomous flight below 400 feet is going to look like. From your perspective, what is the biggest aircraft that we're going to be able to fly down at those altitudes before it gets to the point where everybody says, okay, this has to be pushed up higher for a bunch of safety and operational reasons. What's the biggest aircraft that you expect is going to be flying at or below 400 feet AGL?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you would have asked me that, several years ago, I would have said 55 pounds. I mean, that, that was kind of the standard known and accepted. But as we've seen new aircraft come to market, including Amazon's solution, they're getting larger, right? And I think with those larger solutions, there will have to be determinations on what the use case is, and if they're final mile, they're going to be in that airspace, and, I think as the OEMs look at what's required, and I'll give a couple examples. For small UAS to be successful, you have to get that utilization high, and one of the ways that you can do that is making more than one delivery with an aircraft when it goes out, on a route. So to do that, what we've seen is you're probably going to have to go above 55 pounds. What that upper threshold limit is going to be, I'm not sure. We heard some of the early conversations this week at the FAA Symposium about Part 108, and I think that will help inform what this looks like moving forward. I'm also familiar with the ARC recommendations, a little while back that, I don't know if I'm recalling exactly, but I think it was around 1300 pounds was going to be a limit maybe for Part 108, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're operating in 400 foot and below altitude. So I think there's still a lot to, to play out in the regulatory process to know what that's going to look like. I do think from our perspective, I don't think we would want to use very large aircraft for final mile use cases. I know personally, if I had an aircraft arriving at my home, I think there's limits to what I would want to see above my home, and I think that'll start to inform some of it. Right now, a lot of the activity going on in Dallas, at the site city efforts for UTM, I think that's going to be very informative to the industry to see how those start to take shape. Several operators, same airspace, delivering a variety of products to a pretty broad array of customers. So I think we'll learn more as that plays out and the rulemaking processes as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>54:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, certainly it's a big question in my mind and the people that I've been speaking with in terms of, okay, where is that upper gross weight limit going to be placed for beyond visual line of sight flight, according to part 108, whether it's below 400 feet, which is one scenario or up higher. Agree with you that, a 500 pound aircraft going and doing a last mile delivery over someone's house, that's just going to be too loud. That's not going to be accepted. And there are probably few use cases where that would even be required. But for long range logistics missions that are between, other points, like a depot or something, then you could see a use case for a substantial aircraft making that journey. And it would be simplified, because we have the rules already emerging if you can fly it according to part 108, and especially if you can fly it at 400 feet or below, but I haven't seen a lot of clarity on what that's going to look like yet from the people in the community.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, just my personal opinion is I don't think we'll see those larger aircraft in that 400 foot and below altitude. I think that'll be, more so restricted to the final mile type path. Now, again, the 55 pound limit that we've talked about and that has existed, I think that threshold is going to be too limiting. So I do think it'll go north of that. We, as I mentioned, delivering one, more than one package on a trip. I think that's a capability that could be needed. And then you also start thinking about the onboard detect and avoid capabilities that you want to have on the aircraft, and all of that just competes for real estate. So, I could easily see, like I said, the solutions going north of that 55 pounds, but, that upper bound limit, yeah, I think as you approach that hundred pound mark, I think that's going to be a ceiling somewhere in that ballpark is just my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is your expectation that this will be spelled out in the anticipated Part 108 NPRM that we're waiting for?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I would hope so. I think the more that the regulation can inform the industry, it sets course that's actionable.

Trying to give feedback about what good looks like, I think is where we would want to play. As far as investing, you know, UPS played a big role in ADSB's rollout to the industry. And I think that's a good example of how we wanted to see new technologies evolve, but we understood for it to scale to the global market, we couldn't be the owner, at least it wouldn't necessarily be well received and, so for us, I think helping inform the product is the space that we would be in and then encouraging it's, growth and maturity. But I, at least from my point of view, participating in its, development, deployment view right now at Flight Forward, I would not say we're going to heavily invest in that infrastructure piece, especially when you're thinking about like integration to the NAS. The ground infrastructure, there's places that I think will be important for us to consider. If you're thinking about ground charging infrastructure stations at airports, uh, we'll want to leverage some of the network being built in FBOs, for example, that will have some of that infrastructure. But if we've got certain points in the network that are time critical, we may find that those are locations that we want to put our own, shovels in the ground and, have that capability there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Just recently the FAA approved certain drone operators to operate within the Mode C veil just based on ADSB In information below 400 feet AGL. What do you think the means of achieving, adequate detect and avoid capability outside of the Mode C veil will look like?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, we, believe it or not, when we first started Flight Forward, we tackled a project out in Utah, that was at a healthcare campus, and our proposal was ADS B as the primary source. We thought we were on a good path and ended up not, being approved for it at the time, so I think we were a little ahead of the game, in our request. But we've always thought that was a good approach to hit a good amount of the population, when you think about those Mode C veil areas, it covers the majority of the population in the United States. Not geography, but population. But to hit the areas outside of those locations, we've already gone down the path, and last November achieved BVLOS using ground based radar. And we're looking at various solutions that allow us that flexibility, and I think it'll be a combination of both. as the industry matures to hit the markets we need, but that's, for us right now, ground based radar is that next solution. And then, as we talked about just earlier, the size of the aircraft is going to dictate what you can have on board. And as the solutions get smaller and lighter weight, if you've got the ability to carry that detect and avoid onboard the aircraft, I think that gets very interesting as well. There's a lot of factors to weigh into that cost of an individual aircraft. Again, the penalties you take from a payload side, but, I think those three paths are clearly what's out there, and they'll all serve their own unique purpose, depending on the environment.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, if you were going to have a redo, let's say it's five years ago, and you're going to define your business cases, and you're going to look at the you anticipated 850 different interviews with different OEMs out there, what would you have done different?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think, we learned, it took a while to learn this, but we learned that there was what we call vaporware. There was a lot of people we met with that we spent a lot of time, and it, in a lot of cases, they weren't far enough along for us to spend a lot of time with. So I think I would have, you know, and I love the question because, looking in the rear view mirror, you can't change anything but you, you do kind of re-envision decisions and it, in some cases it can help you look forward and make sure that you're doing things that you would've changed in the past. So I think focusing our effort, on more known items, and then also I think earlier on, pushing a little bit more on the AAM solutions to meet needs. What we've, again, what we've found is a lot of the entrants were focused on air taxi. And I think they've, a lot of them have realized that cargo cargo will likely move first before people. And because of that, I think we could have shifted a little focus earlier on just my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And the use cases within UPS, if you had to do it over again, are there use cases you thought would develop within UPS that didn't develop and why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, so final mile, I think, was more challenging than most thought it would be. And we tackled one of the most difficult problems first. So some of our earliest testing involved integrating a drone in a package car. And what we quickly came to learn is that was one of the most complex use cases you could have because you've got a moving point A and point B continuously as the route continues. And at that point in time, a lot of the OEMs were presenting versions of small UAS integrated vehicles. And so I think that was a big learning curve, item for us and the industry. So again, I think it is the small package final mile effort. One of the things that we've learned is that the cost per delivery is a challenge in some cases for small UAS. Depending on the product that's being moved, what we're seeing right now, at least in industry state, to have a return on investment, it's going to have to be a higher value and bring with it a higher required, cost to serve. In the industry, we are seeing other providers deliver things like food and groceries. Some people are willing to pay that premium because they want that just in time service. I think healthcare falls into that category as well, where, there are niches in the market where people are willing to pay that premium. But when we look at how we deliver today, and the efficiency of our drivers, If they're in an urban area, higher population density, they're very effective. Our drivers are great at their job and they can service those high density areas very well. What we also find is as the drivers have to go off of main street USA, the further out they have to go, those rural and super rural, type deliveries, those cost us and them time. And those are the ones that we looked at picking off. But you've got to have enough of those to deliver from a location to make sense of standing up that UAS operation. So those are some things that, we've thought about that. I think there was belief that it would have more applications sooner, and there's been more challenges than expected in that area. And then you layer on top of it weather capability, that's been a challenge, too, that OEMs are starting to solve for, and we're seeing improved aircraft capabilities, but at least at the time of us initiating, there were more challenges than solutions, I would say.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And guys, we've heard some of this on the podcast as well. Some of the pushback and some of the areas where we thought there was traditional use case. Jeff we really appreciate this conversation. Is there anything that you were dying to talk about that we haven't talked about? Or do you just want to get off the podcast?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, it's been a great conversation. It's funny. I could talk all day about these topics. You can just ask my family, But no, these are near and dear topics to me. I think that there's a lot to come in the near term as we see rulemaking start to take shape. And I'm excited to see those things happen because again, for a company like UPS, we follow the rules. We just need the rulebook. and, it's kind of, it's been a tough place for us to really accelerate in when not all the rules exist yet. We've done a lot of things by exemption and, that process is painful and it's really not scalable. So I think as the rulemaking, comes to the market, I think that's going to really help accelerate things for us and others.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So a lot of people would say the UPS is kind of first through the wire when it comes to advanced air mobility use cases. Yeah, obviously, especially in the cargo side. But, if obviously you're one of the leaders, but who does Jeff Luckett listen to as it relates to advanced air mobility or in aviation general, who are the people you pay most attention to?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Wow, that's a great question. There, there are several great partners in the industry. We've clearly had a great partnership with our Beta team. And so, they've brought a lot of industry experts, to their company. and we hear and learn a lot through those partners like Beta. But I would say, last week, as a prime example, I had the opportunity to attend the FAA Symposium, and having key leaders from the FAA and industry, both from an OEM and operator perspective, all in one place that's the venues for me that are most important, where you can actually collaborate and discuss the problems and challenges that we have all in one environment. So I wouldn't say it's any one particular individual that I hang my hat on their opinions, but it's getting industry together and, collaborating in ways that we all help move things forward because, for me if the competition has a win, that's great that's not a problem for us. We want to see everyone succeed because, we really need that to happen for the industry to move forward. And, I don't know. I think that's for me, the collaborative effort getting the right industry players and regulators all together, I think, is a key piece.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, is there anything else you'd like to leave our listeners?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As a final thought, it's been very important for us to interact with the OEMs during development, and I just want to refocus on a couple things. First, safety. is critically important for us in the industry to be successful. I think that everyone also needs to focus on solutions that have a return on investment. If we can't prove the ROI, it's not going to be successful. And then the last piece is just to listen to the customers, not just the cargo customers. But, if a solution is being designed, those doing so should really listen to the people that they plan to sell to, because I think if they start earlier in the process in forming the product, the end result's gonna serve everyone's purpose better and be more successful.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, thanks for joining us.\u003C/p>","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","seoImage":"","seoKeyphrase":"","featured":false,"updatedAt":"2024-08-13T13:50:47.182Z","type":"PODCAST","entityType":"PodcastEpisodeDto","restricted":false},{"_id":"66a905d8162e5d2e5509d35f","id":"66a905d8162e5d2e5509d35f","title":"#72 Srdjan Kovacevic, Orqa: The evolution of drones, vertical integration, and competing with DJI","slug":"72-srdjan-kovacevic-orqa-the-evolution-of-drones-vertical-integration-and-competing-with-dji","pubDate":"2024-07-27T21:00:00.000Z","link":"","guid":"Buzzsprout-15485774","description":"\u003Cp>In this episode, we’re excited to host Srdjan Kovacevic, CEO and co-founder of Orqa.

They were \"the guy\". But later, this system integration really enabled them to produce systems that are simply much more performant. If you are not just doing your own manufacturing, but also rather than system integrating components that are produced by other parties, you are actually building all those technology blocks yourself from the chip out and then from within the chip itself, you can start to unlock all these little pockets of efficiency that sit between the black boxes that you would otherwise connect being a system integrator. And it boils down to, in order for these subsystems to be compatible they need to talk over certain protocols, which are designed for interoperability, not necessarily for efficiency, and they're always a compromise. When you have the luxury of owning the black boxes, the two black boxes you need to integrate, then you can open them and you can tweak them and you can optimize for whatever you're optimizing for. And then unlock a tiny bit of efficiency here, tiny bit of efficiency there. And when you look across the whole system, these little efficiencies compound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>2:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">For those in the small UAS space, Orqa is a fairly well known name. Despite maintaining a low public profile, this innovative team from Croatia has been making significant waves in the industry. Starting with ultra low latency, First Person View goggles for the niche drone racing market, Orqa has expanded to build essentially every drone component, including their own drones, through a fully vertically integrated business model. This approach optimizes both cost and performance and is positioning Orqa is a strong Western alternative to DJI. Welcome to another episode of The Vertical Space, where we have the pleasure of speaking with Orqa's CEO and co founder, Srdjan Kovacevic, about the past, present, and future of small UAS in both civilian and defense applications. Srdjan begins by expressing his disagreement with the belief that hardware in the small drone industry will become commoditized. He underscores the crucial role of hardware in achieving peak performance for small aerial robots. And he traces this misconception back to the early days of the consumer drone industry and highlights how DJI's relentless innovation enabled it to dominate the market. The conversation addresses the challenges and opportunities of vertical integration as opposed to system integration, drawing parallels with the mobile phone industry. We delve into specific examples demonstrating the significance of vertical integration in small drones, particularly in the case of ultra low latency video data links. The discussion also explores how market dynamics and geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine are shaping the drone industry. And Srdjan also talks about the intricacies of FPV systems, their application in modern warfare and the potential future developments in drone technology. As mentioned, Srdjan is the CEO and one of the co-founders of Orqa, the world's leading FPV company. Orqa is dedicated to advancing the state of the art in unmanned technologies and remote vision. Before founding Orqa, Srdjan had a distinguished career in the financial industry with over a decade of experience in asset management. He served as the chairman of the management board of Croatia's 150 million Euro sovereign equity fund and was the Head of Risk Management and Compliance at Croatia's largest asset management company. Srdjan earned academic degrees from University of Oxford with a Master's of Science in Mathematical Finance and University of Zagreb with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering He is a certified pension fund manager and certified investment advisor.

Especially for unmanned, I strongly disagree with that. I don't think hardware is going to be commoditized. I don't think you can ignore hardware. Or, ignore hardware at your peril if you're doing small things that fly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Expand more, please.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Give us some more details.

And, if you ask me that fallacy goes back to, 2014 15 so speaking specifically in a small UAS space, in the drone space, right. And I believe you could trace it back to, point where DJI, really, defeated, 3D robotics, and 3D Robotics decided to pivot in software And, despite the, overwhelming proof otherwise, we keep hearing that mantra that, oh, hardware is going to be commodity, so we should focus on software solutions in the drone space, where, it's glaringly obvious that, the way DJI won was by relentlessly focusing on improving hardware from a generation to a generation of the product and, again, I'll say it, neglect hardware at your own peril when it comes to small things that fly. Software a part of the solution, we shouldn't be neglecting software, but I don't think you can achieve the level of performance if you think you can ignore hardware, or run your software somebody else's presumably commoditized hardware.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Why do we hear hardware can be a commodity? And is there any particular part of the hardware that you think is potentially becoming commoditized?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">so I, I think that goes back to the experience that we had with, a PC world or computer world, like hardware is arguably commoditized there, but, then again, it only takes a look at, what Apple is doing to realize that, yeah, hardware can be commoditized, but if you want peak performance, then you need to vertically integrate and you inevitably end up doing your own silicon, which I believe is going to be the case with the small unmanned and by the way, which is what DJI is doing at the moment. In saying that, people are, willfully or unwillingly ignoring, cherry picking the examples that fit to preconceptions. And I think it's just like, one of those things that are so easy to say, so we don't think about when we say them. But I hate hearing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you think that, this argument is true for component level hardware, or are you referring to the art of integrating a hardware product together with all of the, details associated with it, which we will get into more detail later.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's an interesting observation that you ask it like that, and I think, by saying that hardware is going to be commoditized, we gave up on, the possibility that we can compete with DJI, like a collective, rest of the industry and we're settling for a world of commoditized hardware where, we'll just buy components, that should be interoperable and system integrate them in our own solutions. But it's a good question. And I do think, in a world of other drone manufacturers or other drone systems, arguably the base ecosystems, meaning the Pixhawk universe, or Ardupilot universe, or Betaflight universe. All of these subsets have been driving the development of the software stack, autopilot stack, or flight controller firmware stack towards hardware agnostic solutions to a point where, okay, everybody's running on STM, but like on, on a module level. So I think it's also in specifically in the drone world this approach is actually, giving up on the possibility of competing with DJI which was a fair conclusion up until couple of years ago with decoupling and everything.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">From your perspective, how did we end up in the drone industry where we are today, where DJI dominates in a polarized market, dominating both in terms of growth and product quality, while drone companies in the West are having a hard time competing both in performance and price.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think first of all, we need to agree that DJI is just an amazing engineering company, being started by an amazing founder who relentlessly pursued certain goal and would not accept compromises and infuse the company culture with that sort of attitude. And then, going back, I think again, I'm going to go back to what for me was the pivotal moment in the development of the drone market is 2014, 15 3D robotics coming out with the Solo and then DJI countering with the Phantom. I think that was the turning point where all of us users were finally, able to get a really cheap and highly performant vehicles, drones. And DJI has proven that they're going to be super tough to compete with. And, at the time 3D robotics was one of the most funded Silicon Valley companies. And it was being run just like, pretty much every other Silicon Valley company was run, you do your design and your maybe prototyping on shore. And then, you build wherever it's cheapest. And I think it was the pace of innovation that, that was happening in that space, really just shown how having your manufacturing super close to where your R&amp; D is, that just sets you up, to innovate much more rapidly, to crunch those cycles that you can just out compete anybody else who's trying to do that onshore, offshore kind of approach. DJI started, in Hong Kong, having a vast ecosystem of service providers and manufacturing companies in that local ecosystem certainly helped, but I think this was the, deciding factor that then at the later stages, just, help them compound this advantage and really just, build massive distance between them and everybody else. And, they were just better at building amazing technology to a point where the difference in performance was such that nobody could compete with them. And if like we as work as a, as an FPV company, we felt that, when DJI entered the FPV space, which was incidentally just months after we launched our first product. And I like to say that this was a super scary moment. Imagine you're building an app and your app is, running on an Apple phone. And then Apple decides to, look into that space and all of a sudden that app is part of the standard Apple package. You're pretty much dead, right? So, it felt like that, big 800 pound gorilla, the DJI was entering in a tiny market, which was FPV at the time. And, they were basically able to leverage their influence and access to certain, certain parts of the hardware ecosystem in China in order to provide solutions that were simply out of reach for us. And specifically, this was like, custom built chips that did low latency video, over, over RF, and that was for any other company or almost any other company in the FPV space, that was just completely out of reach from the standpoint of existing know how, access to capital, et cetera, et cetera. So, this is basically an advanced version of what was happening back in 2014. It's just access to different aspects of, technology.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But DJI was also very aggressive in their pricing. If I recall back in 2015, with the Solo, the one that had the GoPro camera and the gimbal, that was priced around 1, 700, while the Phantom 3 Professional package was sold at the same time about 1, 300, but then, a year later, DJI brought the price down to 900 and then slashed previous year's models to as low as 500. And so that pretty much put every other company in the West out of business. And, perhaps because they saw software as an advantage or because it was out of necessity, but Western companies pivoted to software. It was very difficult to compete with that. So, yeah, I agree. It was. It was a very, bleeding edge, innovative product and culture, but it could afford to have such price cuts. And so from that perspective, how did the strategy of their vertical integration play into their ability to outprice the competition. Perhaps this is a good transition to talk about their business model of vertical integration, as opposed to what we see currently in the West and compare and contrast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's an interesting observation and, for me, when I was, looking at that, my first thought was, okay, what the hell they were thinking 3d Robotics pricing their, product at a price point that was higher than DJI, you know, fiercest competitor to begin with. And then, DJI it even went lower than the original pricing. So that, that, that was the first thing that they struck me. But I think that, this vertical integration playbook really benefited DJI at first on the logistics level and on a pricing level where they could simply afford to go down with price because they didn't have a guy that was doing all of their manufacturing that had to make their money. They were the guy. So they could just make slightly less than that. This was a luxury that Western companies could not afford. But later, this system integration really enabled them to produce systems that are simply much more performant. So it was not just the pricing power and the logistics of it, speed to innovate or the ability to slash prices and still make money. It's also if you are not just doing your own manufacturing, but also rather than system integrating components that are produced by other parties, you are actually building all those technology blocks yourself from the chip out and then, otherwise, and then from within the chip itself in, in, in this latest stage, right, that I referred to earlier, you can start to unlock all these little pockets of efficiency that sit between the black boxes that you would otherwise connect, being a system integrator. And it boils down to, in order for these subsystems to be compatible, they need to talk over certain protocols, which are designed for interoperability, not necessarily for efficiency, and they're always a compromise. And then, when you have the luxury of owning the black boxes, the two black boxes you need to integrate, then you can open them and you can tweak them and you can optimize for whatever you're optimizing for and then unlock a tiny bit of efficiency here, tiny bit of efficiency there. And when you look at across the whole system, these little efficiencies compound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Give us some specific examples of where that manifests in drone performance, because as you describe this history, something that jumps at me is how is it that this performance advantage persists nearly 10 years later? If we look in the smartphone space, for instance, 10 years after the introduction of the iPhone, the hardware from competing smartphone manufacturers was all in the same league, right? They were all competing neck and neck. Whereas there's something about robotics or about drones or about this type of system that has enabled the first player and has enabled DJI to, not just have economies of scale, but to have what you're describing as a fundamental gap in performance versus what someone else could build using best of breed components that are available out in the rest of the market. You put those components together and you try and build a performant drone. It's going to fall short, and you're going to explain, hopefully, what that looks like today, and why that is, because I think that gets to the heart of the value of this integration, and it also gets to the heart of your first observation about the conventional wisdom that has been built up over the last few decades of how and why hardware commoditizes. Why is there a wrinkle in this space that challenges that conventional wisdom and leads you to a different conclusion? Let's get down to specifics and really unpack it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the parallel with, mobile phone, industry is a great one because both in, in small unmanned and smartphones, size matters, energy consumption matters and performance matters. And specifically thermals also matter, right? One of the, one of the interesting aspects where tighter integration can lead you to better outcomes than system integration, right. So I think it's a great, it's a great comparison and, In that world, in a mobile world, we have Apple versus others, just as we have DJI versus others in the small UAS world. And it just proves the point that, system integration will get you to a point but it will not bring you to the, the position of the number one player in terms of performance, right? And we're seeing the same thing play out in the smartphone world and in the UAS world. And I'm going to give you an example where this system integration, versus vertical integration really takes you to different levels, and that would be, low latency video as a sort of, specific use for a data link in a small UAS. In low latency video, and this is something that, that, we're very intimately, connected to because this is something that we've pursued and tried to compete with DJI in the FPV world, so we know that really well. In low latency video, there are certain quite different technology blocks that you need to integrate very tightly. And and in this case, system integration, like, it goes one level deeper. It's not system integrating a radio module and a video processing module. It's basically done on the chip level. So if you're not doing your own chips, you need to get a chip that's going to do your video processing, perhaps host to radio, then you need to get your chip, which basically is your baseband chip, right? And the problem with that, and it's that level of system integration. So it's like chip, not board level, but chip level system integration. And in this particular case, neither of those chips have been designed for this particular application. if you're really doing ultra low latency stuff, as we did in the FPV world, in the consumer FPV world, our, measure of latency was in milliseconds, single digit milliseconds. So, like, we need it to be below 30 milliseconds, glass to glass. When the photon hits the sensor to when the photon emits from the display on the other end, that needs to be 30 milliseconds or less.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>22:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Just for clarity, that's important for the human pilot flying the drone to have that sense of instantaneous transparency through to what's happening with the drone. That's where any sense of delay just disappears. Is that what you're\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>23:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, to go to, to frame that further, like, flying, consumer FPV, either racing or freestyle, human is very tightly, embedded in the control loop. The drone is not stabilized in any meaningful way. You are keeping it level by throttling it more or less. So, so you really need, with your eyes, you perceive the response, dynamic response of the airframe and you're providing the control input. It's pitch and roll or it's yaw or it's throttle, which is, arguably the most sensitive part for most of the new pilots, right? Throttle control. So, with low latency video, the lower that latency is, the more tightly you can be embedded as a pilot. You can be embedded into that control, right? This is why latency is important. And, it was funny because when we were thinking about latency, low latency in the rest of the world would be below thousand milliseconds. And there we were counting single milliseconds in order to, acquire frame from the sensor, put it into memory, read it from memory, encode it, compress it, packetize, you know, again, memory write, and then again, make it into a packet, send it off to a radio, and then radio needs to be transmitted, right? So, we're counting milliseconds and, all of these chips are really made for a user experience which operates in a sub second world, half a second here or there, Great example is, encoders, decoders. Like, we're talking about SOCs that have video encoders and decoders. They are made to consume or originate media in an embedded device. Not necessarily to be super fast and super efficient at encoding video and sending it at high frame rates and counting latency in, in milliseconds. So, if you have any latency, you're gonna buffer. And, that you've problem solved. Nobody's gonna, nobody's gonna, notice. So, first of all, like, if, when you start selecting those SOCs and you start asking questions to chip vendors, okay, how fast, yeah, we have a, encoder that's capable of doing, X. Okay, how fast does it compress a frame of certain, resolution? They don't know. They don't care. They don't have that metric, So this tells you that, we're trying to use a chip for an application that was not even like an afterthought to folks. And then on the radio level, on the radio SOC level, like, if you want to be, affordable for consumer space as we want it to be, you need to go commodity and commodity in this world means, Wi Fi SOCs, 802. 11 as a standard is not optimized for that kind of latency. It's optimized and it's designed for, interoperability and coexistence. We need to have a number of 802. 11 APs and station devices that, that, need to coexist in the same space. So they, they need to be able to negotiate how they access the spectrum, and not stamp on each other. That's not what resilient, low latency, radio for unmanned applications is. It's all about, consistently and robustly being able to transmit video packets without interruption to the ground station. And again, you're trying to make that radio chip do something that it has not been designed for and all that firmware that's not been designed for. So like, you're having to make compromises. Or go off standard if you can, which you can't because, the volumes that we're doing are so small that all these chip vendors are not paying attention. So, you end up making all these compromises, which then result in a performance that's suboptimal. Whereas, if you had the full control over the entire black box that is the chip and the hardware encoder, and the black box that is the radio, piece, the 802.11 chip, you would be able to, go into that black box, tweak what you need to tweak, make the two black boxes talk to each other seamlessly and efficiently, and without losing a step. And that's how you get the performance system. And which makes the difference between DJI's video link and everybody else's video link. They had the opportunity to, go into those black boxes and access to those black boxes. Whereas rest of the world had to deal with wiring the black boxes, whether the wires are literal wires or they're traces on a PCB, it ends up being the same thing, right? That's a great example of how, being able to integrate tightly outperforms system integration.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Especially in the absence of standards that emphasize the performance qualities that your market needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Now, how do you balance developing proprietary protocols that you need to optimize the overall system, how do you balance that with the need to interoperate in, call it the modern battlefield or in a commercial ecosystem?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's also, that's a great question. I think, the higher up you are in, the, you can draw parallels with the OSI layers, higher, how much higher are in, in those layers, it's easier to be interoperable and the lower you are to the bare metal, it's hard to be interoperable. And the reason I'm saying that is, you know, maybe you will want to do hardware that's, It's gonna be compatible with the Pixhawk universe, so your hardware needs to be somewhat interoperable, in order to be compatible with, with, Autopilot stack. But then again, you also want some proprietary stuff running there. so it's really, this is one of the challenges of building a hybrid, solutions that combine your proprietary stuff to, open source stuff, if that makes sense. So this is a very tough balancing act. And again, it leads to compromises, but the thing that's, that, suffers is that full compatibility.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So given the benefits of vertical integration how do you explain that, outside of a few companies like Orqa like Skydio, like Autel, I don't know, perhaps there's some others that you would like to mention, but how come that there are relatively few companies who are pursuing this vertically integrated model?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think first of all, vertical integration in the small UAS world is super hard, and this is because there are so many constraints, space, energy, swap in general. And there's a wide variety of different technology blocks, really, very disparate technology blocks that you need to, command in order to basically be in a position to system integrate, right? So, ranging from radio on one end of the spectrum to, I don't know, propulsion on the other. Completely different problem sets, but also interrelated in how they can affect each other in a very tight and confined space, which is a small universe. So, I think that like the threshold to, to actually be able to, start system integrating is pretty high in terms of like, simply starting from the number of different teams that you need to have in order to, to get started down that path. And I think, the type of talent that's required for certain technology blocks in this group, that they could be considered exotic, from the standpoint of like the current talent pool that the West is operating on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you have any observations more broadly on this market dynamics and how it is dividing into different segments where one segment is companies that are taking off the shelf components and putting them together for custom use cases, as we will in this discussion call them system integrators versus some that are vertically integrated, and then also, a handful of others that are also vertically integrated, but also very focused on a specific mission, like Manna like Wing for instance. How do you make sense of this segmentation of the market and the dynamics playing out in the future?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I do think that there's always going to be need for system integrators. If you think of the long tail of applications, a lot of these applications in the long tail are going to be much more efficiently and perhaps effectively served by specific system integrated solutions. And this is why I do believe in a long term persistence of component ecosystem, which will serve a diverse and innovative space of system integrators that will go after these, more or less exotic or like, all of these applications in the long tail. And I'm a firm believer in that. And, there's also, this angle of like the solutions that are addressing the head of the distribution, like, your Matrice or your Mavic, they're going to be great for 95 percent of applications or 90 percent of applications. And that, they're not going to be that great for the rest 10 percent of applications, right? So, there's also that aspect of how useful is your Swiss Army knife? So, in a way, this is like going back to semicon. This is why, all those chips that we end up having to use, are not that great for some, niche applications, like, low latency video, or radio, right? So, so, this is the same, this is the same type of dynamic. So I do think that there's going to be, a vibrant ecosystem of, system integrators that are going to be served by hopefully as vibrant ecosystem of component providers. there's going to be demands for interoperability. And, you know, to counter myself, this is going to be driving towards commoditization because you don't have to have this interoperability and, commoditization there I can accept happening. But if we talk about the head of the curve and really going after these most frequent, most, numerous applications, then in this space, we're going to have fierce competition in performance between the players that are able to vertically integrate, and not only to vertically integrate their supply chains, being able to compete on the economics, but also quickly integrate their R&amp; D, being able to dig deep into those black boxes, integrate them tighter, unlock those pockets of, efficiency that will compound into a higher performance over the competition. And in the small UAS world, that means flying longer. That means, safer mission. That means easier operation, all these things that kind of, make an overall user experience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Can you give a, perspective of near term market size for the component manufacturers, for the system integrator, for the service delivery company.

This low latency video comes from this niche consumer FPV space, which is where, the pressure cooker of consumer FPV where Orqa was born. But, outside of that, at the moment, like, your typical unmanned, remote operation scenario is not that, latency sensitive. Now, the lower the latency is the more dynamic remote operation scenario you can tackle. And, I think it's like one of those things where what's possible technologically, really defines what applications can be, but for the most, remotely operated or like, and even autonomy, right, Everybody's talking about autonomy, whether it's land based or aerial. In any massively fielded autonomous system, there's always going to be a percentage of edge cases where a human operator is going to need to intervene to get the bot out of the situation. Even in, in like, ideal world of autonomy, there's always going to have to be an option to remotely operate. Remote operation is integral part of the autonomy stack because you will need that. Even five percent of edge cases creates a necessity for hundreds of thousands of hours of remote operation. And then the latency of your video is going to allow you more and more dynamic situations, if that makes sense, right? But one thing I'm going to tell you what we were pitching back when we were kind of goggle company and low latency, you know, this was, you know, 90 percent of our stack, we were pitching this kind of remote reality as opposed to virtual reality, which is a technology enabling, an operator a immersive experience of remote real world setting, in a way that would enable the dynamic interaction scenario. So you, it would actually allow you to interact with remote environment. But I think that's still in, in an SF realm, in an SF domain. no,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, in autonomous systems, as most of us have been thinking about them, and the community has been working on them, you'll have video as a sensor, but a lot of processing of that data will be done right there behind the camera, and then only a very small amount of data is transmitted anywhere based on it. In this case, it's looking at, well, if you could transmit the full video, even over an RF link, even over a long distance, and you could do it at this type of sub 30 millisecond latency, what are the implications of that? What does that enable? Whether it's a human on the other end that is consuming the video, okay, that's remote operations, we know about that. Or whether it is machines that are consuming the full video on the other end, is that a frontier that we're looking at? Does that have implications for how you coordinate massive numbers of automated systems and enable them to coordinate very closely together? Is this an enabler to that, or is this a nice to have?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I, I think you're onto something there because like, especially for smaller autonomous systems, if you can displace that power hungry, and hot running compute from a small thing that flies perhaps, then, you would need a way to, to get that, sensory input at lowest possible latency. And, it's much cheaper to run a video compression workload or video pipeline then it is to run a autonomy processing pipeline on a tiny thing that needs to be autonomous. So, so, there's certainly, displacing the compute, displacing the brain kind of thing, which is also an added, benefit to, to like having low latency.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So there have been attempts in the past for Western drone companies to displace DJI, or at least, come close to it in terms of market share, but none really achieved any meaningful, interesting success in scale.

And then, the ban is creating a space where all of us, Western drone companies can have an opportunity to build something, to, because we, as a collective West, we lost, we lost the first half of the game, of the match in aerial robotics. fair and square, DJI won for better or worse, like, you'll have people saying, oh, yeah, they were subsidized. Yeah, well, probably, yes, they were subsidized extensively, but, we cannot hide from the fact that, they just did a marvelous job at engineering those solutions. And we have a chance to catch up, like collective West to catch up, leverage technology supremacy that we have in other fields, such as semicon. Collective West still has an edge in semiconductors over China. So, we are now getting a second chance to compete in aerial\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So if you were going to put together the dream team, what would you do to make sure the West catches up as soon as possible?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Oh, that's a great question. That's a great question. You mean like on, capabilities level\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, there's a vacuum we've, well, we created the vacuum, right? And so we need to be able to create a Western superior product to the DJI. Who would you assemble? What would you assemble in order to be able to put something together that's better and price competitive?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I strongly believe in the possibility of the DJI of the West. I mean, this is, this is our, this is the premise that, that Orqa is building our future five, 10 years. We think that we can grow into a DJI of the West. But I'm a strong believer in DJI of the West having a strong presence both in United States and in Europe. And I believe that being able to serve those two markets, in, in full sense of the word, like being able to have customer intimacy, being able to have strong presence, and being able to, share identity. And then not, it's not just like, Orqa as European company opening offices in the States. It's also about being deeply embedded into the respective ecosystems. I do think that, strongly believe actually that, this is the way to build a DJI Out West. Have a very strong presence in both of these ecosystems on both sides of the Atlantic and, be able to, to really, serve customers on both sides of the Atlantic. And, when we talk about serving customers, there's going to have to be a, super tight integration especially if we talk about on the enterprise level, let alone defense, which is a story in and of itself, but even on the enterprise level, there's going to be, there's going to have to be a tight level of integration with all these aerial data collection devices and, how the data is being used and processed and decided upon, right. So, so, so, that requires, deep understanding of enterprises in their all specific shapes and forms on both sides of the Atlantic. Because, arguably there's a difference in how utilities operate in the States versus EU, for example, right? And then, you can look across all these other potential application areas. I'm not talking about how it's technically operating, but how they're organized, how they function and all these sorts of things. So I do think that this is like a strong advantage to a transatlantic player over any player that's going to be solely in US or solely in Europe, right? And learning from DJI Playbook, integration matters on the logistics point and pricing matters. And like, EU has done a tremendous job of reaching out to, more Eastern parts of the continent and integrating those economies and leveraging the beneficial costs environment. So, there's a good 10 to 15 years where this is going to be an advantage until we kind of level off. So there's going to be a substantial advantage of having a European, a specifically Central and Eastern European base, in being competitive on a cost level, both on R&amp;D side and the production side. So I think this is also an important factor.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Let's talk more specifically about the emergence of a credible DJI competitor. You mentioned a couple of catalysts. One being the, vacuum that's been created by the DJI ban that's been growing in, in scope and we'll see how that discussion ends, but we haven't talked about Ukraine, which is another great catalyst for the entire industrial base. In a world that looks much different than back in 2015 in terms of the maturation of the industry, the components, the supply chain, will the winning playbook be the DJI playbook, or will the maturation of the market and the technologies needed to put together a system like that, will that create an opening for another playbook?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think that, Ukraine and War in Ukraine is a massive, contributor to this, to this dynamic in unmanned, especially aerial system, small UAS and if you think about it, it's a perfect storm. On one hand, like you have these large swaths of market that are not accessible to DJI, primarily in the defense and security sector, primarily defense, and then later leaked out onto the law enforcements and security and critical infrastructure, et cetera. And then on top of that, you have this profound revolution in how defense thinks about UAS combined and, reinforced, right? So, so, before Ukrainian war, defense thought about UAS in terms of fixed wing systems, predominantly half a million, thereabout price point operated on a relatively high echelon of command. And what Ukraine is proving very graphically today is that the bulk of utility of unmanned actually comes from small UAS copters, multi copters, operated on the lowest echelon of command and deployed in massive numbers. And then, if you combine that, like massive need for small copters in the defense sector, and then, defense sector itself being sterile of DJI, like, this is like a complete no go zone, like, maybe there's a gray area in law enforcement, arguably, law enforcement agencies still could use DJI in Europe, but in defense, no way. Right. So the defense is like completely free of DJI competition for all of us other companies. So, these two dynamics are creating a perfect storm for a step up, massive step up in demand for the types of solutions that, would be provided by would-be DJI competitors and providing this initial momentum that will drive the, innovative cycle. So I think, even without the Ukrainian war, this dynamic and this kind of DJI West playbook became viable. The Ukrainian war just cranked it up to 11, really.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So fair to assume that a number of companies will come in and rush to get into and fill that vacuum. How do you expect the competitive dynamics to evolve on each of the segments? Let's look at, the consumer, the defense, the enterprise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So for consumer, I think, we have to look at different segments of consumer. There's like a, retail, consumer, market, which is, basically still, open for competition and DJI is untouchable there simply in terms of performance, the price, pricing power, it's the obvious choice for the consumer. Now, if we talk about educational segment of consumer type products, that's a different story because again, especially in US, this is also an area where Western companies have this unfair advantage that we can leverage in order to get business, be able to reinvest in R&amp; D and provide solutions that are going to be fully Western made. So, there's these two different sectors. And we as a company, we're looking at educational space where we can provide fully Western made solutions. And then we look at really some niches where we can compete on a purely technological and pricing basis. Now, enterprise is still, I believe, somewhat contested, although I've heard examples where, companies are really reluctant to go for DJI or Chinese solutions. So, this gives an unfair advantage to, to, Western companies. I think this is going to be contested, and it's going to be harder to compete with solutions that are not, as performant as DJI, however you want to measure performance. But I do think that, as opposed to consumer, you will still be able to sell a good enough solution. You know, you don't need to be better, you just need to be good enough to be able to sell. And there's like a large portions of that enterprise market where this is going to be the case. And then defense is, defense is purely like, it's going to be, and it's not going to be, it is right now the space where we're going to see most of, the business, happening for Western drone companies, in the small UAS or multicopter space, which is typically dominated by DJI. I'm not talking about Fixed Wing type platforms. We have a lot of great companies operating in that space across the board, talking about really small copters.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What are the major cost drivers for developing a small UAS system? What we hear is that for performance that is, somewhat approaching DJI's performance, you can get that from a Western drone OEM for three, four, five times the price, depending on, on, the specific use cases, et cetera. Can you generalize the major cost drivers and how certain catalytic forces like the Ukrainian war and the broadening of the industrial base, how that might impact those prices?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think volume is the dominant one. I don't think that prior to Ukraine, there was a conceivable scenario where a Western drone company would be in a position to sell a lot of copters to government users. Now with Ukraine happening, what we're seeing is a lot of, Western defense, end users are waking up to the fact that copters are going to be needed and copters are going to be needed in large volumes and copters are going to be used in an attritable manner. You deploy them and you're going to expect to lose them within three missions. So you better stock up on them. And not just that, you better invest in a capability, churn them out in large numbers, should you need them. Now this is a major contributor to, to really willingness to buy, willingness to invest in this capability, and like in the capability to, to develop these technologies, right, and support, Western companies and giving them business and contracts, et cetera. So I think volume is the main, you know, this understanding that, small UAS, small copters, that's, if you look at Ukraine, like this is all Mavic and Autels are the workhorses of the battlefield on both sides. And we as a collective West do not have a solution that's comparable to either.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You've been an early and leading player in the FPV segment, which now has emerged, or has grown from a very niche to volumes that dwarf any other segment. So can you talk about how you've experienced this evolution and kind of the trends that you're seeing and how you see the future?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's interesting because, before the war, we, had all these different strategies on how to popularize FPV because, you had to explain to people what FPV is. And for very unfortunate reasons, FPV has arguably become a household word now. And, you know, how that plays out, and I'm talking as a company that, that was started as a hobby company, consumer company, how that plays out and how FPV is perceived after the war, you know, it's anybody's guess. And I'm not entirely comfortable as FPV enthusiast, I'm not entirely comfortable with that situation. I don't know whether FPV is going to exist after the war, or, will we be able to fly FPV as civilians after the war. So I'm not entirely comfortable with that. But what Ukraine started is like, it showed how effective, consumer grade technology can be in a modern war. And that's the, I think the most impactful part of the whole dynamic that, that developed because, what's being used in Ukraine is essentially a hobby grade, technology that's incredibly accessible from the cost perspective, from the technological perspective, you need a bit of skills to build, and quite a lot of skill to operate, this type of vehicle, but nevertheless, super accessible. Like I cannot be expected to build a Javelin myself in my garage, but I can build an FPV in my garage. And with an FPV, I can probably hit a tank at a greater distance than I can with a Javelin. And I can bill it for like, what, 300, 500? And, Javelin is what, hundreds of thousands? So, this gives you an idea of how much disruption happened\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Can you just describe first person view? What is it? What's its value? What happens if somebody doesn't have an FPV capability for those who may not know as much about the market?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So FPV stands for First Person View. It's what we used to call our hobby prior to the war. FPV today stands for a first person view, manually controlled, quad captor. That is a radio controlled, a drone that's capable of carrying an explosive payload and it's operated fully manually, like as you would a race drone, by a skilled operator. And, this is basically, you can fly a drone for, a couple of kilometers and you can, strike an armored vehicle, which costs in millions with an asset that's, you know, the, some people call it an, like a flying IED that, that costs like hundreds of bucks, to build. And, we've seen a lot of companies coming up, in that space, being a component provider, we could see a lot of Western companies coming into that space, but in reality, Ukrainian war in particular, although that created a lot of interest in the West and that, created a lot of companies that are looking in that space, realistically, this again, was dominated by Chinese companies who were well placed, to serve both the needs of Ukraine and Russia in providing either components or build systems. And I think, if you look at, how various Western companies performed and Orqa included, trying to compete in that space, like again, we collectively couldn't compete with the Chinese on, on, on prices. And I don't think we should, because longterm, I think that FPV is specific to Ukraine and it's a phenomenon that's, indicative of absence of other means of strike by both sides, and, whether, strapping an explosive ordnance to a copter, whether that's going to be a optimal way to do precision strikes, that's anybody's guess. And my guess is, you know, probably there are more optimal ways to perform strikes, kinetic strikes. But what I'm certain of is that copters are the optimal way to provide battlefield transparency, the type of which we're seeing in Ukraine right now. And, as much as I don't think that the FPVs as a strike capability are going to stay here post Ukraine, I'm 100 percent certain that copters, which may or may not be FPV and arguably don't need to be FPV, will persist as a principle way to provide situational awareness and battlefield transparency, in the future. I'm not saying that the fixing platforms are going to be done, but I'm saying that, we're still going to have these fixing platforms operated on a higher echelons, but we're going to see much more copters being operated on a very low command levels. The challenge is going to be really collecting all of the data and then processing it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What have you observed in terms of how FPVs are being employed in Ukraine? How has it changed since early 2023 to today? What do you see coming in the future, and what is it about that that makes you think that FPVs are perhaps unique to the Ukraine conflict and that they're not going to continue to evolve in this way for future conflicts that they'll be supplanted by something else. I think that there are people out there with, the assumption that this evolution, what we're seeing in Ukraine is going to continue and that Western militaries across the spectrum are going to be rearming with, massive numbers of FPVs and incorporating these into their tactics as a lesson from the war. But if you have a different view on how that's going to look, walk us through that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Oh, yeah. I think, if, if you wanna have the nitty gritty realities of use of FPV in Ukraine, I strongly advise, listening to War on The Rocks, podcast and Russian Contingency where, Rob Lee and Mike Kaufman are really, delivering direct from the battlefield experience of FPV operators. And this is very detailed and highly informative in terms of tactics. So, what we're observing, is basically there's, some cat and mouse development in terms of electronic warfare countermeasures and being able to deploy these systems, freely, so there's a big change between, what was working at the early stages of war to what's working now. We're seeing a lot of, evolution in terms of how the electronic warfare measures are deployed and how the, systems are evolving to, be able to, operate in the presence of, electronic warfare. So there's that. These FPV systems are being, operated in an increasingly larger numbers. And basically both sides have been very successful in adopting those and evolving the tactics of their use. But ultimately I think, again, this is a specific for Ukraine because, simply because barring, drones, FPV drones and drones in general, and the anti air systems this is a very low tech war, ultimately. And, these FPV systems are being applied in a, a bolt on manner. And whether I'm seeing FPVs that are being used in Ukraine right now being used by, uh, in this form by Western NATO member countries, I would say no. Just starting from the fact that once you power up the drone, you're broadcasting unencrypted video feed to whoever cares to tune in. Like, just start from that. And, this goes from the fact that because of the latency, and because of the EW resiliency, you're compelled to operate an analog video system, and there's no efficient way to encrypt or scramble analog video system, just that, that leaves you with having to broadcast your mission, to whoever wants to tune in in the vicinity. So, so there's that. Also, like, I don't think that we should be falling into a trap of thinking that these are super efficient systems simply by looking at social media. And this is one thing that, that really, repeated by the people who had the chance to really observe how these systems are being employed. Like the efficiency numbers are super, super low. because. If we look on the social media, we're just seeing the strikes, but, then there's a massive, positive selection, happening there, right? So you will not see unsuccessful strikes being posted on Twitter and, you know, all the FPV pilots, from before the war, they know that, whenever you fly, you turn on the DVR because, if you lose a drone, that's how you find it by looking at the DVR footage. You can imagine that if every FPV mission is filmed and the operator has the footage, then you could even, say that we have seen every successful strike that happened, right? And we can be fairly certain that most of the successful strikes have been actually recorded. And in the world of social media and viral dynamics, this creates a powerful echo chamber where we all think that this FPV is this super efficient new asset, which, you know, we really have no grounds on making that conclusion because we don't know how many unsuccessful ones there have been for every successful one that we see. So, this second piece is efficiency. Third piece is, FPVs are really hard to operate. It takes a lot of skill, and this was one of the barriers to entry to the hobby before the war, which we were facing as a consumer company, like it's really hard to get people to remain and then to persist in the hobby long enough so they can enjoy it. Like, you really need to struggle before you get the skill and you can actually enjoy flying because it's not that easy. And I have hard time imagining, FPV being deployed in a big army sense. I can totally imagine it being deployed in a highly specialized manner. So, I can totally imagine FPV being a part of a special operator's toolkit, like that skill set, right? So, you train for a sufficient time, you become a great pilot. And then this gives you almost superpowers, right? And then arguably this can be a, a Special Ops thing rather than a big Army thing. Then again, simply the logistics of, deploying large number of FPVs is a stretch to be, you know, diplomatic. I mean, I'm going to give you an example. Whenever we would go out and fly for fun, there was always problems with frequencies and 5. 8 band, which is where you, where your video operates is very narrow. So you effectively have eight channels. And if you go out with a group of friends, like five or six of you, it's a logistic nightmare to make everybody stick to their own frequency. Right, so you always have this situation you're flying and somebody plugs in and they're on your frequency so all of a sudden you can't see anything. So trying to extrapolate that experience to a chaos of war where there's not only your side trying to deploy these missions en masse. There's adversaries trying to deploy these missions, like it's a nightmare. it adds to that thing about how efficient it really is, this question. So, compounding these five, different aspects of, like, reality of FPV I don't think it being used massively for strike. What I am, again, I'm going to say it, what I'm seeing this Ukrainian war changing in a way, how, army uses, copters is this situational awareness, mass deployed, highly attritable platforms for, defense applications. And, as an FPV company, we get a lot of, oh, FPV is the big in Ukraine. you guys, must be selling hundreds of thousands. And I'm like, no, the only ones making money in this FPV space in Ukraine are Chinese companies that, that perhaps they were making ready to fly drones in maybe single digit thousands per batch. I can totally imagine a lot of these companies doing tens of thousands per month, easy. And that led, funnily enough, that led to the commoditization. the price per system is like 500 bucks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Isn't there an argument though that technology will continue to innovate and try to close some of the gaps that you were talking about, whether this is better use of the RF spectrum, better, digital data links that are also resilient to EW, better logistics, better deployments, better ways for humans and machines to interface. Isn't that a valid argument that this arc of technology evolution will continue and make FPVs relevant in the future? Or if not, how do you see that arc continuing to evolve?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and I would add increasing automation of the flight control itself. All of those things, what would you want to see in terms of changes across that spectrum of technologies that would change your conclusions?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, I think, one of the gaps, certainly is, spectrum management. It's also EW resiliency for the high throughput data links, and video arguably is a high throughput data link. It's very hard to sustain sufficient data throughput over an RF data link for digital video. If you think that even 10 percent package loss of a compressed video is total, video loss. That's, super hard to sustain even in a congested RF environment, let alone contested RF environment. So, so, that, that's going to have to change in order for, these systems to be viable and a prerequisite for like, I think wider adoption, FPVs is going to have to be moving away from freely broadcasted analog video, which all of the FPVs you're using both in defense and in the hobby are being used, are using right now. I can totally see a benefit in adding automation and autonomy to these systems. It's gonna reduce the barrier to entry for skill required to operate. It would not have to be a matter of dexterity and ability to, to really, fly and, skill it's gonna, it's gonna be learned and it's gonna, you'll be able to learn more efficiently. But also, and I'm going back to this point of whether copters are the right strike vehicle. And that's always this thing that I'm coming back to. And I know that this trope of swarm of drones is a very attractive one, but have you ever seen how drone light shows are being deployed? It takes a stadium to set them up. So you're literally setting up an acre of drones almost in order to deploy a light show. So this trope of having swarms of drones attacking, like you would be, you, there, there's a lot of logistics that needs to go in, in deploying a large number of drones. And if one thing that we've learned about this war is that in a transparent battlefield, you need to reduce your logistic footprint, not, so, so in, in a way, we're going to have to, innovate, like collective we, we're going to have to innovate heavily in order to come up with a smaller footprint for deployment swarms, if we want to make swarms a thing. And then it brings me to the question, is copter really a great platform for strike? Or are there more, like, compact, efficient platforms to deploy strikes at that distance with that type of payload. And again, I have to go back to saying, expressing an opinion that, I think that both Ukraine and Russia are using FPVs as a matter of necessity and accessibility. It's more of an accessibility thing, because all you need is 500 bucks of Chinese components, some carbon, and explosives, to be able to affect a, precision strike beyond line of sight. And that's it. and, couple that with virality of the footage that, we established is recorded for every mission by default, because this is what you do as an FPV pilot, you DVR everything. Like, when you add that two things together, like, you get this impression that, oh, it's a massive thing, whereas, reality might be completely different. But what we are seeing is, a lot of Western forces are, working to, acquire these capabilities to, learn how to deploy them, learn how to use them, learn how to defend against them. And I think this is going to be here to stay, but I think that, this is a starting point and it will necessarily evolve and what's the end state, the, final form of it. Anybody's guess. And I'm really not. even, arguably being an insider and understanding, this, deeply because, we were doing it before it was cool. I wouldn't dare to venture where it lands, like, what's going to be the final shape of the strike vehicle, and I'm not sure it's going to be a copter. On the contrary, I'm kind of willing to place a bet that it's not going to be. Where I'm willing, again, 100 percent to place a bet is like for, low level ISR situational awareness, there's hardly a better thing than a copter.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Srdjan what's the message that you'd like the audience to take away from this discussion?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, two messages, like, first of all, building small things that fly, it's super hard.

So I think, ultimately if there's like one or two things, this would be that, this is hard, this is very hard.

The viability of it has been proven very clearly. That this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think there has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space podcast and our conversation with Bobby Healy, CEO and Founder of Manna Drone Delivery. Bobby was a standout guest when we had him on the podcast back in March of 22, and we're delighted he could join us for a return visit today. Returning guests, give us such a cool perspective. They provide an update on the original assumptions and actual outcomes of the last two years. And with Bobby drone delivery overall, and more specifically Manna Drone Delivery, he reminds us of the original assumptions, what has actually occurred and what's been pleasant and disappointing surprises and how he sees the future and perhaps differently than his original assumptions. For those of who know Bobby and listen to his original conversation, you know he's a compelling, articulate industry veteran and accomplished aviation business professional. He's both a person who understands the technology and its application, and combines this with decades of aviation knowledge. And highly successful aviation technology implementation. This isn't always the case with some of the innovators and leaders in advanced air mobility. And it's perhaps one of the reasons more our app to bet on Bobby's projects and his vision for the future. And as we do with all guests, we listened to their important messages and we politely challenge their core underlying assumptions. And we've done the same with Bobby. Listen to what Bobby says is the killer app for drone delivery. Do you agree? He provides details with market size and price, which is refreshing. He talks about the value of B2C versus B2B in drone delivery. This in itself would make for a good podcast discussion as a lot of companies are focusing on B2B delivery. One of Bobby's essential messages is that the economics have now been proven for this space. Listen to his discussion of business and operational profitability. As we all know, getting to profitability is a challenge for any business. And it has been particularly challenging for some in advanced air mobility. Listen to how we discusses how Manna wants to power big and small brands directly. As an example, he has a deal with Coca Cola, where he flies their products. He discusses how he simply wants to replace the road and that consumers will and should never go back to road based delivery. If you listen carefully, you'll hear why Bobby has been more successful than others. I was a bit surprised by technology is actually deploying in house versus what others would hope he would purchase from outside technology providers. And finally listen to where Bobby believes advanced air mobility investments should be made beyond drone delivery. His answers may or may not surprise you. So many, thanks to Bobby for rejoining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our talk with Bobby Healy as you innovate and generate profits in The Vertical Space. Bobby kicked off his career building video games for Nintendo. He then founded Eland technologies an airline technology company, which he sold 12 years later to SITA. He then built Car Trawler the world's largest mobility marketplace for airlines over 15 years and led two successful LBOs for the business. For the last four years he's been building Manna a\"Drone Delivery as a Service\" business, whose mission is to improve the world by making lightning fast, suburban deliveries, affordable green and safe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, welcome back to The Vertical Space. We first spoke in March of 2022 and so we thought it would be great to bring you back and talk about the drone delivery industry and what has changed there, as well as what has changed with Manna. A lot of things have changed. So time to debunk some myths.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And it's great to be here again, guys. I'm really looking forward to it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Perfect. As you know, we typically ask if there's something that few in the industry agree with you on, would you amend your original answer or something else that's on your mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">If you look at my LinkedIn, you'll see that argument or the main arguments play out. Most people assume, not people in our industry, but generally people think that the use case is critical products, medical, defibrillators, urgent, societally beneficial products, and they are great use cases for sure. But the economic reality is that coffee and takeaway food is the killer app for what we do. That's one thing that most people, they don't disagree, they're just uninformed. They haven't done the work or the research that we've done on where the market opportunity is. And then the second one kind of hand in hand with that is a lot of people believe again, incorrectly that the unit economics or the capital economics don't work right now that they will at some point in the future when some magical technology comes along to make them work. But that's where I find, I enjoy myself the most on LinkedIn answering some of the people that have, raised those questions because I mean, I have the data, we have the flights, we're operating with profitable economics now. And I do enjoy engaging with people on the many misconceptions that are in our industry. And thankfully, we've already debunked them, not in theory or research. We're actually flying the debunk, even today as we speak we're flying aircraft in Dublin that are running profitable unit economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I would add that even when we talk to industry insiders, there is a tendency to think that B2B delivery use cases will be the ones that scale first, or at least if you asked them a couple years ago. There was a general tendency to believe that urgent cargo, high value not necessarily high volume movement will be the one that gains traction initially, especially because of the, arguably easier safety case to build with predetermined points in the network, as opposed to ad hoc, don't really know where the next order will come up, low value, you know, how in the world can you make money, delivering coffee and meals, et cetera, et cetera. Yet, as we often discuss on the podcast, those use cases didn't really scale past POCs and pilots, globally, whereas the, B2C delivery, the kind that Manna is doing is really starting to show some interesting inflection.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I agree. In the end we're running an infrastructure and that infrastructure is an airline. It's a cargo airline. And just like any other airline, utilization is a key factor in the profitability of that airline. And every airline in the world talks about load factor or utilization in our world. And you don't get that with high priority, critical goods, the volume just isn't there. So there's no world where you can make, those critical medical type deliveries a very interesting business from a commercial standpoint. And the other thing is you don't learn anything by doing that. Other than building an aircraft, you don't really learn anything. The real learning in serving the space we serve is in being in the trenches doing five, six hundred, a thousand deliveries a day out of a small car park and getting a 30 second turnaround time and embedding that learning into the software, into the hardware and iterating through that. So unfortunately, and there's a number of great players in our space that are doing and have done a really good job, pioneering job, I would say in medical delivery, but it doesn't translate in any way whatsoever to suburban, backyard, high throughput delivery. it's just two totally different paradigms and two different things to optimize.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Some of the guests we've had on have sometimes mentioned coffee delivery in a trivial way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Disparaging way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. And so, so when, as you're saying, listen, it's a, is it a good start for you? Is it a good proving ground for you? But can you scale and meet your financial projections that you want to hit in the next three years, delivering coffee?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already, every single coffee delivery we do is profitable. So 100 percent of them now, like we used to be at the weekends because we'd have higher utilization and then, weekdays were less so, but now our volume has diluted the fixed cost per location so they are profitable. And the thing about coffee is there isn't a product as popular on the planet for adults on a daily basis that has the adoption rate and the frequency and the gross margin that works so well that where the benefits of flying in a straight line as we do underwrite the new mode of delivering these products. So in a world where there's no such thing really as coffee delivery and people are now, I mean, you know, Starbucks or Starbucks drive thru is an example of Starbucks mobile app, people are absolutely addicted to, I would say, high consumption patterns, high frequency purchasing coffee. So of course it's going to be the best product. But now you say, people do trivialize it. Yes, only because I think not from a business sense, they're not saying coffee isn't a great product, but they're really saying, I think, is using the airspace to deliver a coffee seems like a bad idea to me. That's really what they're saying without saying it. And that's the purpose of I think regulation and the standards like Part 108 or in our case, U-Space in Europe, standards that are scalable that do allow high throughput in that airspace below 500 feet. And when we look at the market size we estimate that today there's 5. 2 billion food deliveries a year from the top four aggregators annually growing at 15%. So think DoorDash Uber eats all the way down and that's with a constrained market where there's a labor shortage, there's labor costs, economics problems, and there's a quality issue. So, so therefore those 5. 2 billion orders, road based orders are coming from customers that want it come hell or high water. Even if it's a bad customer experience and it's expensive. And the U S customer is paying nearly a 60 percent premium on basket value to get that pizza delivered. And they're never happy with it, but look, 5. 2 billion orders. So that's the current market. Our estimate puts it at a 16 billion order market without even trying, if we can remove the road from the equation and use aircraft. So you tell me one industry where you have probably a hundred billion dollar market staring at you in the face that's untapped, where the technology has proven we've already got positive uni economics. And the only thing between us and that giant market, I guess there's a social acceptance thing. You can't go too fast, too quickly. There's some regulatory, things still to unlock. But if you side that up beside blood delivery or vaccine delivery or whatever, it just dwarfs that space. And we didn't want to take on something easy. We wanted to take on the most impactful, space and that is everyday goods to everyday people in every suburban house on the planet profitably. And we're at the start of that now.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The other thing that strikes me about the coffee and the last mile consumer delivery is that you have the opportunity for a very consistent operation in order to make deliveries into all those customers in the market. By and large, they're already accustomed to ordering things from their phone from the ground based delivery aggregators. And in contrast, when we went and looked into the B2B medical delivery space, at least in the developed world, the companies face a pretty involved enterprise integration and organizational integration for each customer or each segment of customers. How is that flight operation going to work? Who is going to have the authority to initiate a flight? All of it ends up being a pretty heavy front load, cost and integration and it's heterogeneous operations as the business grows. Whereas in this it seems you already have a foundation of educated consumers accustomed to receiving deliveries via phone operations and it lays the groundwork for a reasonable path to go and scale a company to go and address that market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and there's no, enterprise sales process or there's no finding a budget somewhere in some hospital or some company's budget to try and do this innovative new mode. Our customers are the ones that are drinking the coffee. And they're abundant and they're aware of us and it's viral and all of these tailwinds to what we're doing that don't exist in the enterprise market. And then the other thing is we, again, we look at different densities. So European population density is much higher than US population density in suburbs. So for example, in Europe, we use a lot of motorbikes to move blood around between hospital critical to beat the traffic and it's very hard to justify, you know, why would you spend a large infrastructure budget and drones when the motorbike network's already there, largely run by volunteers. it's just sometimes forcing technology into a place where technology doesn't belong. Now different in Africa or, you know, countries that don't have transport infrastructure anyway. And of course there, you're not providing drone delivery. You're providing transport infrastructure. But there's already solid transport modes in most modern economies that are not as good as drone delivery, but they're not far off. So your benefits are marginal. And then you're incurring, as you said rightly, all this overhead of cold chain of all the trail of every part of the process for that sample or whatever it is. And then of course, toxic substances. a lot of the products you might want to fly in medical areas are considered hazardous substances, so, chemotherapy drugs is a great use case, but you're into a whole other area of risk there. And we just said, look, there's parts of that prize that we're interested in and we also liked the fact that it's a critical need to deliver those products, but at the same time, it comes with just such difficult challenges on the economic side of things that from my view, it's always going to be a business that's subsidized by something. And that's, I think, why it succeeded so well in Africa to date. And I think honestly, it's going to be challenged in other markets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I may say something really quickly, we can move on from this. As it relates to medical delivery, and in clinical pathology versus anatomic pathology, so blood versus tissue, I think an argument could be made that there's high volume of both, and tissue pathology will have a much higher critical factor, and there'll be a lot of price behind that, because there's a sensitivity to it where that may be a good market. I think they're both relatively high volume, but one difference between a cup of coffee is that the economics may not play out unless there's a lot of volume in the delivery. They're not going to pay a lot for one piece of blood, and I think one thing we discovered, Luka and Peter, on one of our podcasts was what's the real value of getting it there a little bit faster when it's a 24 hour turn on the testing anyway? But my sense is that the, and Bobby, in hospitals, labs, there's a very large cost item set aside for courier.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's a big element for labs. So maybe that's a next stage for you if the economics play out, but that meets a lot of your criteria, conceivably clinical and anatomic pathology, maybe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. I mean, I'd love to be, I'm not sure I'll be proven wrong here. What I'm, I guess in the end, what I'm saying is if you're going to build an infrastructure then you underwrite the cost of an infrastructure with a viable business case, and then all the other applications can work on top of that. So if you're already in a city or a suburb or whatever it is, and you're flying trivial products, albeit you're making money doing it, why wouldn't you then deploy that for other use cases? It could be beer. It could be medicine, like you say, samples, all of these things. And we can pick products up as well as drop them off. And why wouldn't you deploy? Of course you would. But you don't start with that because you're always going to be building a business that needs to be subsidized by something. And again, it comes back to ambition and scale. And for us, the ambition is unlimited. And we say, what is the biggest use case that we can solve? And it is, no matter what you say. It's always going to be the suburban household and their needs. And that's going to be what will underwrite the infrastructure for any successful player in this space. It ain't going to be medical.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>19:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, you talk about the potential to expand the market from what 5. 2 billion deliveries per year today with the ground based aggregators to something much larger. When you look at the differences that drone delivery brings into the equation, whether it's speed or environmental advantages or a safety case or cost, what do you see as being the key drivers that are creating the behavior change that leads you to think that there's a 16 billion a year, delivery opportunity?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">There's existing numbers that show adoption rates of road based delivery between 4 and 5% around the world and they kind of point to a low take up rate and there's our own data as well. and there's different states. I think that the restaurants are a small business. Think the consumer at the end of it all. And you look at the different things that they think are important. And in the case of the restaurant, restaurants frequently, they just can't, they can't get delivery, right? It's just too expensive. They can't do it themselves. The aggregators that power them, the, DoorDashes and Ubers and so on, that power them and themselves are constrained with output as well, if it rains, if the weather's bad in any way, or if it's peak time, you just can't meet the demand peaks, with people, it just doesn't work. So the result is batching, where multiple orders are put in with one driver and therefore cold food or terrible quality food and unpredictable times. And that's reflected in the NPS or the ratings of all of the aggregators, which are on the floor, not because they're not great businesses. They are, but they're constrained by just a limited output that they have. So why are we different? Because we're point to point. our average flight time is just less than three minutes. Physics is on our side. And when you have that advantage, the outcome is look, it's literally as simple as the outcome is hot food or hot coffee or, and in good condition. And that is remarkably the most important thing. It isn't speed. It will speed kind of translates into quality, but also reliability and predictability, which is as important as quality. People are willing to wait 15 minutes or 20 minutes. They are willing so long as that's what it is. But with batching and traveling, the traveling salesman algorithm, there's no way to be sure about that. So, so the variability is very poor. And so the consumer is going to modify their behavior because of drone delivery and the advantages it has. And we already see that in something as simple as coffee delivery. And before we existed, there was no such thing as coffee delivery in suburbs. That nobody would be crazy enough to do that because you won't make any money but yet our basket value in our coffee shop is more than twice the the basket value of the average order in the coffee shop itself, because behavior, right? It's a household order. So it's 2. 3 beverages per basket. There's a bunch of pastries and so on and then the other stakeholder for us, as I said, the vendor, the small business, they're looking at this saying they're now able to reach a couple of hundred thousand up to half a million customers in their catchment area of less than a five minute flight. And they're saying this is massive for their business. So. That's another stakeholder. And then the final stakeholder for us is the aggregator itself. And we'd expect our business is going to be, we call it B2B. And what we mean by B2B is we just want to be a delivery company. So we want to power the aggregators. We want to power the big brands. We have a deal with Coca Cola where we fly their products, but we want to power all of the big and the small brands directly, simply replacing the road. And so you think about the aggregators and their numbers are public. The aggregators lose money on most of their orders in suburbs because of the time it takes to deliver them and the labor costs and the labor laws. So we know the benefits to them are actually simply unit economics. we can do a delivery for them cheaper than they can do it themselves quite simply, and still make a strong margin ourselves because of our operating economics. So there's different stakeholders, but it, and some of them, it's about economics and some of them it's about experience and quality, and some of it, it's about growing the market. And by the way, the five to 16 primarily comes from number one is actually just widening the addressable market. So you're going from where the aggregators really only want to do very dense areas and quite short trips to obviously optimize their costs. We can now do much longer trips and support much less population dense areas. So you're actually widening the market to those like 92 million detached single family homes in the USA. And similarly in Europe, there's these really fragmented towns, suburb cities that aren't that easy to address for the traditional mode. So it's a combination of just customer behavior, I think, and market addressability.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, you answered the question, but I was going to ask if there are categories of products that people just wouldn't consider ordering via ground based delivery because they just know it's going to take too long, like a latte or something. And are you seeing that people will order those products given their expectation that it will arrive faster via a drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, we survey them as well. And quite interesting. If you look at lots of publicly available data, the key categories for road based delivery are, in order, if I just pick one market, the UK, where there's great data. And it's quite similar in the USA as well, but there's the top one is pizza. And then it's, other products like Indian or Chinese and burgers and fries is like fourth or fifth in the list of, perishable prepared meals. But actually if you ask people what they want to eat, burgers and fries is the number one thing. So what's going on there is people already know that certain products just don't deliver well, they don't travel well, and anyone that's got a road based delivery of burgers and fries knows that after 20 minutes, it's just toxic. So, so therefore you can't reheat it either. So, so consumers know not to order these things. So in the existing road based data, there's a hidden demand that's there that's not satisfied. We know that already from ours. And our number one, outside of coffee, our second one is probably tied between burgers and fries and ice cream. And an ice cream is an interesting one because you don't need a lot of choice in ice cream, right? You just need a quality, well known brand or two for the customer. But ice cream is interesting because it's 168 hours of the week almost, it's almost flat by hour of day of week. And it's driven by family orders, right? These are orders that have an experience associated with them, like a party or watching a movie or things like that. And the alternative is getting your car for 35 or 40 minutes to get the ice cream if you don't happen to have it. So we do see people now starting to rely on us for certain categories like coffee and ice cream that they might've pre purchased a week at a time and stored it in their fridge before, and now they just don't care cause they can get it from us and then the really the alarm bells, I think in a good way that ring for us is that burgers and fries in terms of meals are number one category. And finally, I would say people are saying, finally, I can get French fries. It actually tastes like French fries and they arrive. And I know that sounds trivial, but it isn't. It's the flagship product of McDonald's, right? I mean, French fries. I started this business because I wanted a bag of French fries and we call them chips in Ireland. I joke about it, but I did. And it's one of those, highly sought after products that delivery just fails.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>27:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I mean, Uber is a great case study in how an addressable market can expand when you introduce a new capability or a new user experience. I don't have the data to back this up, but I'm just basing this on my own consumption patterns and those close to me, but I'd be comfortable saying that a lot of Uber users their budgets for taxi and black cars prior to Uber were not the same as their Uber budgets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And the amount of music people consume now, it's Spotify. there's things that consumers never would have told you they wanted until you gave it to them and then they're absolutely reliant on it. It's like air and we'll be the same. We already are in the towns we operate in. It's just, people are blown away by the fact that they can get our service but at the same time, they straight away adjust to it and they start to get angry with us if we're 60 seconds late it almost feels like for some of them. So, so, and that's a good thing. it really is the end of road based delivery. When you offer this service, consumers never going back to road based delivery. And I think that's not unexpected. Our job has been at the engineering level to make sure that no matter what the weather is, they wouldn't need to go back. So that means flying in minus 20 C plus 42 C, very strong winds, I think 35 mile an hour winds, things like that, rain, obviously snow. And if you don't do all of those things and really from an engineering point of view, harden the product, you don't have a business. There's no point being a drone delivery business for fair weather because the restaurants and the customers that you're powering, they'll just, they just, if you, if they can't trust that you're going to always be there, you're a novelty, you're the circus. And that's not who we want to be. So you have to start with the very hardest of solutions and an engineer for that. And when I think about what advice I would give people, you can't start in this business with a halfway house. You have to have the final, picture solved. That's a mistake we nearly made at the start. And just by sheer luck, we happen to be in Ireland, which is the worst country in the world to do a drone delivery business, permanently raining, permanently windy. So therefore we can fly in any weather, but it comes back to, and it's very important. I know it sounds like engineering, but I'm trying not to be too engineering about this. But if you want to be real in drone delivery you have to replace the car fully. You can't be partial replacement. And that makes it much more difficult. The engineering equation is just much harder and the testing equation is much harder. Even the delivery mode, the way we deliver the software we've written for that arrival at the house and delivering, it looks simple. but it's not, it's quite the opposite. And then testing that out in the wild and, is one thing in a big field in the middle of nowhere, but testing it where there's customers underneath you, is a whole other thing. And that takes so much time. Sorry, I'm wondering, but it goes to what do you need to solve for, right? You need to solve for predictability, availability, speed equals quality, cost, unit cost, and yeah. So safety, I don't even talk about safety because you don't have a right to exist, if you're not safe and that comes down to, yes, we have governance because we're regulated by aviation regulators and a lot of oversight comes from that. But. It doesn't make you safe. There's a million ways to still not be safe, even if you're regulated. I think that comes from, there's a, there's an existential threat hanging over the industry if it's irresponsible when it starts to scale. And what that translates to, It took us five years and I don't think you're going to do much quicker than that. And when you start developing a backyard delivery product to, to really scaling it, which is where we are now, it's somewhere between three to five years timeline. And no amount of fantastic engineering, or engineers speed that up. It's a process of gradually evolving, crawl, walk, run more and more volume. You can't please the investors with this one. You have to manage them and let them know that it's a long, arduous process to make sure that you're safe. And I certainly see that in the industry, we've done a great job at that. I don't see anyone pretending that it can go, at blitz scaling pace, but it will, and I think there's a number of, operators like ourselves, like Wing, for example, Google's program that are now ready to start some really, serious growth in a safe way. So, but it is not your typical industry where a five year path normally to a startup, building a viable product with viable economics and the start of a revenue journey. That's very difficult, space by any measure. And so it'll come to what's the market look like in, in a decade, who'll be there, how many will be there, that kind of thing. Just because you mentioned the word safety, what it translates to is a market that's going to be a very few number of players with sufficient deep pockets and patience to get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, Bobby, delving into the customer experience a little bit more. Are you, guiding customers towards expectations for how long it will take for different categories of products to arrive from the time that they push order on their phone? What is a reasonable expectation for a latte versus a hamburger and fries versus other takeout food. Obviously the drone delivery operation itself is a consistent time period, but the preparation time and the other\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">what should customers be expecting?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. There's a very difficult problem to solve actually and the big aggregators have, have done the best job at this simply because of time and the data that they have. Truth is a restaurant that's preparing meals is a very unpredictable output line, particularly smaller ones. And from a day to day or hour to hour basis, quite difficult to predict. Now there's some very large brand players. I don't need to name names, you know, they are, but they can produce a meal every 20 seconds and they can get one through their drive through every 35 seconds. And so for those types of brands, we can tell the customer down to the minute when they can expect to see their nuggets or their fries or whatever it is land in their back garden, essentially for the others, and we have a number of vendors that are, they're a super product, but they're erratic to say the least. So we tell the customer it's a three minute flight or a two minute flight or whatever it is based on the range and the wind. And then we say, and the prep time for this restaurant is between five minutes and you know, with Google flights, you get this kind of bar chart of likely we give them a bar chart of likely arrival times based on the vendor's prep time. And we tell them what's happening as well. So they know in our app or through our API with our B2B partners, they know when the vendor started to prepare, they know when the vendors finished preparing, they know when we've received the goods from the vendor. They know when it's been loaded onto the aircraft. They know when the aircraft's taken off and then they can track it in real time. So the reason we do all of those things is the customer can always see progression and that's important. So the customer does not mind waiting 15 minutes 20 minutes for their burgers and fries, so long as you keep them updated on that progress. And so we measure time by stages, but if I look at my order to arrival time. So it's a time the customer pressed the purchase button to the arrival time. We see a range for products like our Coca Cola delivery, the median time for the aircraft to take off after the order is two minutes. Flight time is three minutes. So, so median time about five minutes all the way up to the premium, we've got this French guy that makes these, delicious sandwiches, but he takes 20 minutes to make the sandwich, but again, it isn't about the actual time. It's about the confidence in that time. And look, our NPS, our net promoter score is 86 year to date. And that's because we have this obvious advantage that we fly, but also we manage, as you say, the customer expectations very clearly. through constant messaging of progression of their\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay. So as you scale and demand increases, how do you keep customer expectations realistic? If it's coming up on lunchtime and you get a bunch of, order interest coming in and you have only so much, delivery capacity during that hour and that, beyond a certain amount, deliveries are going to be delayed simply because you're waiting for a free drone to go and make that flight. How do you prevent customer disappointment with the experience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And we have an advantage there over road as well, because we know if we look forward at the next 60 minutes and we calculate capacity in the next 60 minutes for any given GPS points, we know pretty accurately how many orders we can handle for the next 60 minutes. And that's the window where, it's actually between 30 and 60 minutes where a customer will say, I'm not willing to wait that long. I'll drive myself or I'll do without. So the first and foremost, there's no point adding capacity blindly if you don't know how to assess it in real time. So the way we look at it is we continually add capacity in units, as our repeat cohort of customers grows, so too does our volume, orders per hour, per day of week, and that's pretty easy to anticipate, and we just allocate extra capacity ahead of time. Overcapacity for us isn't such an issue when you look at the aircraft utilization, because we don't care so much about an aircraft sitting on the tarmac. We care about the people's cost, the people cost that would load that aircraft cargo, they're there anyway. So when we flex up and down capacity, it's more about flexing up and down the people that manage or load cargo or monitor those aircraft than the actual aircraft themselves.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the most utilization sensitive component of your operation is utilization of your human labor, not utilization of your airframes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Correct. Yeah, we don't really care about utilization of the airframes. I mean, we do, but in the end, don't forget we have mobile aircrafts. Our aircraft can load balance from one cell to the other. In other words, the aircraft can autonomously go from one location to another to serve demand in different locations. So we can dynamically allocate the fleet to. And there's other great use cases like parcel delivery, postal delivery, for example, and pharmacy delivery, even that you can take orders with a four hour window on them and just send them in underutilized slots. So we can balance our utilization through the day, particularly daytime hours. So I think as we grow, there'll be more of those what we call latent orders that have a window of delivery time that don't need instant delivery that we will use our fleets to fly. So I'm not too concerned about the aircraft itself. It's the people and we have two modes of operation. We have one where we're highly centralized, all the aircraft and a handful of people. And also, for example, one of our people can load between 20 and 30 flights per hour. So that's our number, right? and 20 or 30 flights per hour is the best you're going to do because our turnaround time is between 30 and 60 seconds, right? Aircraft landing, aircraft taking off and that you can't beat that. No, there's no way to beat that number. But that's the cost, right? That's that person's cost for those 20 or 30 deliveries. And you want them fully utilized. So if you're over budgeted on those people, then you're going to increase your cost per delivery. So that's the way to think about it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, what's been the biggest change in the drone delivery market in the last two years since we talked?

And like I said, I always, I'm not a great mathematician, but if you scale a negative number, you get a larger negative number, no matter how hard you try. no, look, we already have$4 in and around sometimes less, sometimes more dependent time of the week and the cargo cost per delivery fully loaded. Right. That's, and we're going to, by the way, publish this data, both on LinkedIn and through our friends at McKinsey. And so you'll see it and, but you can also see a very clear path to$2 cost for delivery, like literally with our eyes closed, we won't get there at the end of this year. We won't be far off it, but even limited scaling will bring us to a$2 cost per delivery. And what we want to win at is that, going back to the Warren Buffett, right, in a commodity world and drone delivery, ultimately, at scale and over 20 years commodity, right, it's A to B safely and quickly. The winner will be the ones that have the best cost of operation. This is why Ryanair succeeded, is why Southwest did so well in the earlier days. And we learned from history of running businesses that it's not the coolest product that's going to win in this space. Nobody cares. it's about the cost. So, so what's changed, I think we've demonstrated in superb fashion that the industry is viable, economically viable, and I think that's important. And then I think regulatory wise, again, we now fly BVLOS all over Europe. We have license all over Europe. Europe has really strong, difficult, but really clear regulations. USA has moved forward at pace as well. We see pretty much everyone operating with 135s, we see Google really starting to expand their operations, we see major brands like Walmart really leaning into it, so I would say ahead of expectations in Europe, for sure, and what we would have predicted in the USA as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What about a disappointment, Bobby?

I would love to see, and we would love to be flying under 108, very soon, but, still uncertain and uncertainty kills an industry like ours, well, it doesn't kill it, but it just makes it very difficult for companies like us to continue to grow and raise money to grow when there's uncertainty around the regulatory environment. And so 108's a discipline. Well, it's not a disappointment. It's great. We love it. It's the right shape. It feels exactly what the industry needs to scale. It's just hard to say when those, rules will be written and we'll go through the process and become, routine. So is it a disappointment? No, like I'm pretty happy that we have BVLOS in Europe. There's, 500 million people here, 300 million of which we can reach. so there's plenty of business. And I would say to any drone delivery company. get over here and start flying. Like Google are flying a mile away from my house here, where I'm recording this from, Europe is a fantastic place to build some scale. It's not as great a market the USA, it's a market where you can really get flying anyway. So, so disappointments, they're not really disappointments. They're just, it's the, I just wish it could all move a little bit more quickly in the USA. and other than that, I think we're in really strong shape.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How should we make sense of the different operating cost numbers that we see in the industry media or being talked about across the different companies that are doing this?

I would say, remembering WeWork and community adjusted EBITDA is the phrase I would think of here. You have to include packaging cost, battery motor depreciation, prop depreciation, maintenance, aircraft depreciation, personnel, all of the other costs, but those are the main ones that I listed there. If all of those aren't in your unit economics there's already a problem and particularly aircraft depreciation. So again, that goes to our aircraft has a useful life of 75, 000 deliveries. And that means that our depreciation factor is relatively low. And that's an intentional part of our product design, even battery management, battery maintenance, those ones should be equal for everybody, right, because we're all using lithium ion in some way. And we're charging them at different speeds, discharging them at different speeds, but largely speaking, while we think we're better than most on battery, I think you could pretty much assume that everyone's the same in that regard. I think where all of the players differ greatly is in longevity of the aircraft, how many cycles you're going to get from the aircraft. It's throughput per hour. And that comes to hot swap architecture or not hot swap and then charging in situ kind of the opposite of hot swap. Charging in situ means that your battery won't last as long. And after the person loading the cargo, battery is your biggest unit cost. And what I mean by that is if you're charging a battery in sub zero temperatures, or if you're charging a battery in very high temperatures, it's not going to live as long as a battery that's charged at a consistent temperature indoors. And that comes down to aircraft architecture and operational architecture. In other words, hot swap battery, the battery's only outdoors for 60 seconds before it flies. We've thought about all of that and we've thought about it because of our focus on unit costs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so you're treating batteries and motors as consumables. Those are not going 75, 000 flights. Those are being replaced periodically, but it's the remainder of the aircraft that you assert has a 75, 000 flight life. Okay, so how many flight hours, just from an aviation standpoint, comparing the expected life of this aircraft in terms of flight hours? How many is that? Roughly 15, 000 flight hours?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's a divide by eight, divide by eight. We do eight flights an\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">hour So what is the remainder of that airframe? What data do you have that, gives you confidence that this is a 75, 000 flight item? And what's your approach to continued airworthiness and maintenance of that object over that time?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Data. So our old aircraft, we call it the 3.8, was a 20, 000 flights aircraft. And we've never written one off before that, but we have many of them that have done more than that. We've a couple of aircraft over 20, 000, 25, 000 flights each. So we have formed there. We know what are the things to engineer for. When you talk about our newer aircraft, which we call 3.8.4 really it's functionally no different than our old aircraft, except for the propulsion system, which is a, it's a much easier maintenance system because most of the failures in our previous aircraft came down to wear and tear during maintenance, during routine changes of parts of the subsystem, props or, motors. So our new aircraft airframe, a single piece of carbon fiber, no moving parts. And that is easy to cycle, right? It's very easy to cycle that airframe through actually half a million flight cycles, on simulator on test benches, should I say, and get the data. And that's the process for evaluating what the lifetime of each component is. You're right, our motors and our batteries and props actually, for that matter, are in our unit cost. So we write off motors after 2000 hours. We write off batteries, in a number of flights, a number of cycles. So it's very predictable. And props less predictable although there's expected lifetime for props, it's mostly, preemptive, I would say monitoring for imperfections or damage to props and changing, but it's stack ranked it's battery, motor, props. And then we apply just a consistent percentage overhead to the entire bill of materials on the aircraft outside of that annual cost, which is quite conservative to get the look, this cable failed or that, that LIDAR unit failed or whatever, because components fail individually and in very unpredictable ways. And so I think the right approach there is just apply a consistent proportion of the overall bill of materials in an annual tax almost in form of maintenance and component switching. And we're, we've been in this five years, we think we have very good data on that. So we're, and as I said, we're quite conservative on it, but it's still overall the depreciation of the entire system for per flight is quite low. It's certainly lower than the person loading the cargo. And then continued airworthiness or maintenance and, the traditional aviation part of things, I would say our old aircraft or existing aircraft depending on what you're day you're operating on, is an aircraft that required a lot of overhead, a lot of maintenance inspections, frequent inspections, frequent overhauls. And we moved now to our new aircraft that just self diagnoses everything, designed for high throughput, long time without even an inspection. But it still backs down to very traditional aviation practices for keeping aircraft in the air and ensuring that they're safe. We, I don't think we're any different there than company that flies small planes or helicopters in the processes, the training, all that stuff that happens.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Given that you'll be publishing some numbers soon, are you comfortable sharing with our audience some high level,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Of course I\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">major cost drivers and the specific\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I actually, I predicted you would ask me, so I actually got a breakdown. Yeah. Yeah. Are you ready? Well, why wouldn't I talk about this? Because we, we do the best, right? So, so today,$4.27 cost per delivery of which fixed overhead, 71 cents, labor$1.93 consumables and depreciation,$1.63. That's where we are today. And then by the end of this year, well, look, I don't want to promise too much, but that'll probably be closer to$3 than even$3.50. Yeah. And then if I look at the human costs, so, and this comes to our operation, which again will evolve. We have different roles. So we have what we call a dispatcher, which is what others would call a pilot, that's a person that for us can monitor up to 20 aircraft simultaneously. What role they have? I don't know, because there's no sticks. There's no control of our aircraft, but they're there anyway, monitoring, but our loaders is our biggest cost. So, so that those are people that just take cargo from a vendor, load on the aircraft, just over a dollar per delivery. That's interesting because Ireland, in fact, Europe is a high wage environment, and so our hourly cost for labor is about$18. so if you look at that and then you look at our future system, which does not need those loaders, so when I talk about going from$3 to$2, that loader for us goes away and the vendor loads the cargo. So we're not in a rush to do that. We have the system built, we're happy. But for now we want to operate just highly centralized, very well managed, location. So we have that loader cost. And the number of the$1.63 that I mentioned earlier on in consumables, I can tell you stack ranked in there it's battery is roughly 50 percent of that currently that'll come down a bit with new battery chemistry we have, and then motors is second at about 25% and then maintenance, just a fixed cost of maintenance per flight that we apply and props and replacement components is the remainder of it. And there are some benefits to scale purchasing of these were obviously tiny now in terms of scale of purchasing. So that$1.63 we predict at scale will come down to about 45 cents. And so when we get from$4.27, where we are now, down to$3 or say$2 and 2 cents is the number I'm looking at, the bulk of that comes from reducing our consumables cost by just scale and better purchasing power. And then there's a pretty significant, unlock for us in change of battery chemistry, so going to a more conservative battery chemistry, but one that has a higher number of cycles and that comes from, again, this, we see this as a major advantage that our system has is that we don't need to charge our batteries and anything over 1C. So we can charge them slowly because the aircraft isn't waiting for a charge with us, so we might have seven, eight, nine battery systems, cargo systems per aircraft, and one of them is flying while eight of them are charging, so we can charge them very slowly and therefore get many more cycles out of the battery. And that, that counts in this space. It really does count. The top level architecture we have, we think it is designed for throughput, of course, productivity of real estate space, but also it flows through that because we have this hotswap battery, our costs per delivery are quite a bit lower than I think for people that are charging in situ, but look, those are the numbers. And we're actually going to publish the whole thing in detail for everyone to look at, but there should be no surprises in there. And I think largely our lower cost is driven by our higher throughput per hour.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Are these contribution costs, Bobby, or what costs are not included?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So those are pretty much everything. Those are fixed overheads that we apply, like things like rent and electricity and things like that diluted over the volume of deliveries. And the labor, as I said, and that's, that varies depending on the volume and then the consumables. It's everything. And the depreciation on the aircraft is in there as well. That's a 75K aircraft. So the depreciation is quite small in\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And you mean rent and electricity for the ground infrastructure at that launch site?

And that's a very greatly dependent on where we are, but we've applied a cost of 71 cents per delivery for those fixed overheads\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And what does that$4.27 what kind of utilization is implied in these numbers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Great question. 55 percent over the week.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay.

So don't forget our cost gets diluted by the number of drones, right? And then that's proportional to the utilization of that same number of drones. So if we've resourced it correctly, in terms of the human loaders, then you need a 55 percent utilization of that capacity to reach those numbers. Those are numbers that we deliver today based on our existing volume.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What does that translate in terms of, daily deliveries per aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we do all of that with less than 300 deliveries a day for our four aircraft.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But there are delivery surges, in the morning, at lunchtime, different parts of the day, and then there are low periods. Is that right? And so if that's the current demand pattern, 55 percent is your threshold for these cost numbers, what is a reasonable expectation for the high end of utilization that you can achieve,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">have demand surges during the day and slack period?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, exactly. So volume is what takes care of that, Peter. So you, you reduce. Or should I say you increase the granularity of utilization as volume grows, right? So we already see weekends, for example, we operate 12 hours a day. Weekends are, I wouldn't say I haven't looked last week, but they're north of 90 percent utilization now on weekends. And what we probably should do is add more aircraft and drive more demand, but we are not motivated by volume. We've never been motivated by volume for this stage of the business. We've been always motivated by those KPIs around cost per delivery and optimizing for that. So we're about to open two other bases in the same suburb. So we'll be bringing it up to the gigantic number of 12 aircraft, which doesn't sound like a lot to most folks, but that's a thousand deliveries a day for us, more than a thousand deliveries a day cause they're very productive aircraft. And if we're successful at getting that over time, if we fill that capacity, which we will, once we switch on certain new channels, but think probably across the week, it'll be anywhere from 400 to a thousand real deliveries a day in the suburb. you'll have always have that right, but we'll flex up and down the human resourcing part of that across those, days of the week and hours of the day. And we, we think a natural place to be is about 70 percent utilization and at 70 percent utilization, we're somewhere between 2 and 3 cost per delivery.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You already mentioned that this is all beyond visual line of sight, and that the loaders are the only people involved, so no visual observers. Can you talk about how the, mission execution is done with the supervisors and any progress on the 1:many front.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, for us BVLOS is one to many. And for us, that happened at a year ago where we went from many to one. So we had like two point, two point, whatever people per aircraft down to now, actually practically we think it's probably 20 to one because that person, that resource really doesn't have a role. There's no mission planning. There's no nothing that there's really no role for that person, but we're happy to have that person there anyway, to observe and just to be aware. And there's certain areas, like we fly in controlled airspace as well. And Europe has this thing called U-Space. And we've worked with the folks in Google and in Wing with this as well, about de confliction and then bringing that de confliction up a level to ADS B IN to avoid traditional aircraft. Today, we do all in an automated way, but we'd also use that observer to observe the airspace, the ADS B traffic. But like I said, that cost is ultimately going to disappear completely because there's no role really there. Mission planning is automated for us, so when a customer signs up with us we don't see them. We don't talk to them. There's no interaction. they drop a pin where they would like us to deliver. And then we use data to decide if that pin is a safe place or not. And they're in the system. And when the aircraft flies to them, we do check while we're there to make sure the area is clean. In other words, it's less than a 15 degree angle. It's inanimate. There's no people underneath. And all that's automated for us so that there's no observers required. The mission planning is quite interesting actually because there's a couple of things that are surprisingly innovative in that space. I would like to say rocket science, but it's not rocket science, but the flight planning to optimize for energy use, depending on prevailing wind is important. And then we stream the weather from the aircraft that are in the air. So we have very accurate, very localized and very real time weather data that informs the next flight. And so that's a really important optimization for us in both speed of delivery, but also in, in energy drawn, which allows us to have that nice wind envelope or nice wind capability. And so that's very important, but another equally important part of what we do is mitigating ground risks. So, we have an effective population density where we fly. Like it is very populated where we fly. It is very dense. It's as dense as the Bronx or Queens, for example. It is really dense. And we're flying over about 450 houses with every single flight. So we take ground mitigation very seriously. And we do a lot of work there. And one of the feeds that we have is real time location data from users of our code, of our apps that they give us permission to have, and we'll monitor the space for hotspots of people. And that's a really important addition to what we've done. And so that data tells us, like, for example, if there's a beer garden, there's 500 people drinking beer outdoors in the middle of the summer. And we'll know they're there and we'll automate the flight plan around that. And so that for us has proven to be quite an easy thing to build where data didn't exist before. You couldn't really get that insight into where people were before. And in an anonymous way use it to mitigate your flights. So the flight planning is quite interesting in our world. And then the other part is aside from risk, just pure ground risk mitigation. You always think about, you don't want to be flying over the same places all the time. You want to avoid channels down certain areas to overbother people. So we ran, I wouldn't say randomized, but we, in the flight planning, we do a lot of work to reduce the effect of overflights. And that's been a key part of the acceptance aspect of what we're doing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What third party software are you using, Bobby, in that process?

I suppose our strength as a team has been in software, our businesses before have all been software businesses and either way, I think, if there was available software to buy in that space, we'd probably have bought it if it met our needs. But you have to balance always with software. The difference between software that's 95 percent what you need and 100 percent what you need is probably five years. I'm a programmer myself. That's my trade. It's often better just to build a simple system that exactly meets your needs, then adopt a complex system that more or less meets your needs. And in our case, like it is not rocket science where we're building, we're not going to be famous for how awesome our software or our hardware is. That's not what we're going to be famous for. We're going to be famous for our lowest unit cost and our ability to scale that, I think. But to answer your question, we use zero third party software.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm curious, I have to ask, have AI coding assistant technologies made an impact on your organization's ability to write this software?

I wouldn't call it strategic. I would call it an optimization. We're faster writing code. We're better at testing code. It just reduces the time to write code, but once code is written, the AI is no use to you and, we have a mature platform now, so we're more I'd say tinkering, we're optimizing doing small additions and it's very difficult to let an AI into existing code and start adding things. It's more when you write it from the start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Does it tilt the equation between building your own software versus buying software?

You might, get individuals just up a level. Like some of the code I would have written recently, and I use ChatGPT or Copilot, to write some of my own code. I'm writing code now that takes two or three days. That might've taken me a couple of weeks to write before. Mostly now when you're writing code, you're using frameworks or APIs that already exist to take a lot of learning, to take a lot of time to get to use, particularly in the AI and the vision space, and that's just like, I wrote some code recently myself that, that used our security cameras to look for people walking close to an aircraft or onto one of our landing pads. That code took me less than two days to get into production. And that's something that would have taken me a month to write before. And I'm, programming 35 years. So, so think about it that way. And I think that's the only right way to think about it. Just, it just makes existing good programmers faster and better. It doesn't replace the programmer. And so your decision, whether to buy versus build would more be about if somebody has matured a platform already that has done a scale drone delivery operation, it automatically by that fact will have evolved into the right piece of software for us, and I would buy that all day long, but nobody has written a piece of software that runs a drone delivery business at scale yet, except us. And I would say Wing. And so would I buy wing software? Yes. I would buy Wing's software, but I wouldn't buy anyone else's because the software evolves in line with the way you use it and you have to use it in order to develop it, I think.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You mentioned earlier that the consumer pays upwards of maybe 60 percent of the value of the meal with traditional, terrestrial food delivery. How does the drone economics impact, the wallets of the customers and the restaurants?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that, that number comes from actually a McKinsey work in the USA where they measured and it's, yeah, it's a 55 to 60 percent increase. So you buy a pizza for$30, you're paying$45 or a little bit more. In our case, we, I mean, you can get our app, we're charging customers$5 a delivery. And we haven't seen it. That's a little bit more expensive than they might pay for that direct. Here's my delivery fee number on the ticket. but we don't mark up the menu. We don't add surcharges. There's no tip obviously for the drone. So to the customer, actually, we're probably on a par with existing road based delivery, the way they might see it. Now it's only in the USA that everyone pays this gigantic premium on basket. In Europe they're paying about$7 fully loaded, but with tip and all that stuff. And so we're kind of in a par and I think a better question is, do we think there's room to charge more? Or do we need to charge less? and I think that's comes down to elasticity of demand. The drone does, favors there. It's really elasticity of demand on consumption, right? Whether they want the hamburger, whether they're willing to get it delivered or go outside. And if we're much more expensive than road based delivery, that's where the elasticity comes in. They're just going to go back to road based delivery. So I think our industry always needs to be on a par at worst with the existing mode or otherwise better. And then that translates again, back to our unit cost story. We think there's a world where a subscription is a real thing in drone delivery. And that's where we'd like to be. We'd ultimately like every household in the world uses us like Amazon Prime or like Spotify or just part of their monthly, thing in the household. And we think we can get marginal costs down to the point where that will work. And just like Prime or just like Spotify this is an almost inconsequential monthly cost for a household and we can use that to subsidize deliveries and still make our money by charging our partners a commission on basket value. So, we see enormous upside in the take rate or the revenue per delivery without needing to increase the cost to the consumer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How do you expect unit cost numbers that you shared with us to change in the U.

In Europe, that means implementation of U-Space. The regulations are there, U-Space is there. It's just rolling it out, but there's already four or five countries in Europe that will have U-Space this year. And USA, I think that Part 108 is the answer for scale. I don't think 135 is, although there can be the initial growth and scaling in the USA, which I think we'll all do a little bit of, but true, unlimited, unconstrained scaling, I think needs 108. So that's the bits that are out of our control. I think everything else is just execution. It's a capital intensive world, so you need a lot of capital to scale this, even though it's got a good return on it. Like our capital returns in 14 months when we open a new location, it's funded itself after 14 months. But you still, as we're growing a lot, you're going to need, a lot of capital to fund that growth. And I think debt will be a big part of that finance of the aircraft, just like in aviation. So will that be a constraint? Probably not. So then you move on to, again, the things that are in our control, but will quickly get out of our control. If we don't act properly and responsibly as an industry and as individual operators, we'll be punished by regulation. Cities will slow us down like they did the scooter industry. If there's accidents or, anything really that worries people, that will slow us down. So there's a risk there that with the rise of good regulation and the issuing of licenses that people might try to go too fast when they're not ready. They're rushing to get an aircraft to market. They start flying it and they ruin the party for everyone else. If anything slows us down in a material way, that will be it. And will it happen? I doubt it because I think the regulator on both sides of the pond have been very thoughtful about this. And I don't think anyone will be allowed to fly at scale unless they're safe. I just don't see a world where, you're going to have, people allowed to take risk. We obviously are not going to, but I don't think it's a world where you're going to have small operators that raise a seed round and start flying around communities. I don't think that's going to happen at all. I see this being an industry of two or three big players worldwide that will operate properly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby in three years, are you a$15 million,$50 or a$500 million revenue company?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In three years,$100 million plus, I would hope to think, and that could very well be all in Europe as well with some of the contracts we've signed and with the state of the market here, there's every possibility that we could get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And at a hundred million, you're a top three player you're saying in the world?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In drone delivery, we want to be the number one.

Without giving too much away, there's north of a million dollars out of one small base for us in annual revenue. And there's 10, 000 similar suburbs in Europe alone. If we just got to a thousand of them, that's a billion dollars revenue business and with a contribution that pays for itself in 14 months. So you pick, you just won't find an industry with those numbers anywhere that exists today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Then what stops you from being bigger than a hundred million in three years?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">it's not software, right? So it isn't, obviously the marginal cost of a unit is there always. We have to manufacture, we have to deploy the boots on the ground. It's a difficult business to scale. I compare us to a Starbucks rollout back to the Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz was on the podcast recently and he broke the numbers down and he said, look, it's half a million for us to generate a million dollars in revenue. It takes two years to pay back. And so he's all about debt financing and trying to go fast, but just it's slow. And I think we won't be as badly affected by that, but that's naturally difficult part of scaling our business. It'll take a while to get to a billion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already touched on this in the conversation about availability, there's, two potential paths that somebody in this industry might take in terms of how deep in a given geography they want to go, whether they want to offer a full capacity service to the customer in one smaller area or expand a little bit more aggressively, but not go perhaps as deep. How do you think about that trade off?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we think about kind of Goldilocks suburb of hundred thousand people and up, potentially we could make slightly smaller ones work. So think 50, 000 people and up. And if you look at that as a filter, there's some other ones like number of restaurants within a hundred meter radius of an anchor restaurant, an anchor tenant, things like that. But if you filter it down, you come to about 10, 000 locations, as I said, in Europe alone, that, that are viable for us to deliver a minimum number of, orders. so, and then if you say, okay, from a strategy point of view, do you want a thin layer? That means then you have that incumbency, advantage in, in many markets at once or as fast as possible, or as you said, do you just own a handful of markets such that they're impenetrable and you don't share them with anyone? And we've seen that play out in food delivery, in the USA and then later on in Europe. We've seen the way it goes. Each market gets its own lead player. And then 10 years on, there's consolidation for efficiency reasons, mostly, and you end up with two or three players in the region, in the continent. And I think there's a potential where if we just stayed in the main European markets, that a smaller business will start up in Sweden and one in Spain or whatever, we'll and for us anyway, we don't want to let that happen. We want to go slightly thinner in more geography, early than going deep. And primarily because we learned from the previous two industry scooters and, food delivery, and you could argue mobility as well. So, on demand rides where if you leave a market alone, something will grow there, and then you're postponing a problem of either competition on economics or, competition on marketing and owning the customer, and I think it's better therefore it's not a black and white, but I think generally we would favor going wider and more shallow. That's a stronger position to be in.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just to make sure I understand when you say that shallower and wider, do you mean not saturating a metropolitan area with presence in every suburb, but, perhaps a few suburbs but you're not thinking that, okay, once I'm in one of those suburbs the shallowness will be a characteristic of the service that you offer such that the risk is that you disappoint customers when they go to the app and say, oh, okay, great. Thanks. I can't get the service. I'm disappointed. I'm deleting your app.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">it won't be the customers that will decide whether they're getting drone delivery or not. It'll be the aggregators and the vendors won't give them a choice because it's a lot cheaper for them to fulfill that order. So when we say shallow, in an area, it means we go to a large city we'll do all of the suburbs over 50 to a hundred thousand people, but the suburb that's only 25, 000 or less, they're not getting the service because we'd prefer to be growing to the other suburbs in Madrid and Berlin and Stockholm and so on\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right.

Yes, correct. So yeah, you don't want to go into a suburb and have a inferior product to what the aggregators themselves have and the aggregators themselves will want you, us, to be able to power most of their choice, some of their choice is impossible to power. You've got these real, tiny little restaurants tucked away in corners. And there's just, you're not going to get an aircraft there, but we'd like to think the 60th or 70th percentile of volume, we'd be able to get, and that in terms of volume of, or choice translates to less than 50 percent of choice. or percentage of restaurants in the area that you'd need to care about. But don't forget it. Go back to coffee. If all we ran was a coffee delivery business, we'd be a gigantic business and that would be a lot easier to fulfill than takeaway food.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, if you, as knowledgeable as you are, your background in aviation, your success in aviation. And as you think about advanced air mobility overall, let's say we break it down to a couple of different buckets. Let's say military drones, let's say commercial drone delivery, whether it be coffee, medical or the like. Or three, let's call it eVTOL, STOL let's say those are three big segments of AAM. What excites you and let's say you were an investor and you had to invest your money. I will assume you will say commercial coffee drone delivery will be an early candidate for investment. What would be next and what would be last?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">My next, without a doubt, in fact, if I wasn't doing this now or I wanted to do something new, it'd be military, defense, look at Anduril or Look at the geopolitical landscape right now and there's a race for sure to arm countries defensively with technology and that technology without a doubt is going to come in the form of flying robots largely, and that's going to have myriad sensor tech, software. It's a software play more than a hardware one. There's obviously a fusing of them, but I find that a really interesting space. And I think, the world is going to be investing a ton of capital in there and the opportunities are enormous and I'm probably unusual in that. I think that's a good thing that industry thrives because it's actually a way to reduce war, not increase war. So that's what I would be doing and I'd be doing it from the USA. cause I think that's where most of the investment's going to happen. So yeah, that's what I would be doing. I wouldn't bet on passenger mobility for a while. I just think it's too hard. I just don't think the physics work well enough yet, and the economics are, I find them difficult to see. You know, they work and it'd be interesting for sure, but I would, I'd be investing in, and working in military defense tech before I'd be doing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As you think about aviation technology, as you think about advanced air mobility, who are the thought leaders out there that you listen to?

I think Adam Woodworth in Wing is an amazing guy. I met him last year. What they've achieved is remarkable. And closer to home, my own team, I have Siggy Zerweckh, 25 years in General Atomics that just, oozes aviation engineering. I'm wowed by the engineers, so you can probably hear that. And thought leadership in the space for me, more important than those, engineering visionary types that I mentioned are the ones that actually understand business as well. And there I'm afraid the industry is guilty of not being real from a business sense, but I have to say, it would be for me, Google and what they've achieved and drone delivery is who I would hold up in the highest regard. And thought leaders, most of your guests, I think, if I look back, you've done a good job of choosing them and I find them really every time I'm surprised, I've never heard of this person. And then suddenly I've met, somebody that's really understands the space better than I could have imagined.

Right now, it has been primarily funded by venture capital, but clearly there are other types of investors that are going to step in and fund the scale out and thinking about, from your vantage point, who are they, what are the things that they want to see and then what will the financing of the scale out likely look like?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. So I think for who's going to pay to scale it out and what, how does the industry, get the capital it needs to really grow at its natural ability. The numbers are gigantic, right? There's probably a couple of hundred thousand, half a million aircraft are going to be needed in the next five to 10 years, maybe more, maybe less. These are big numbers, in terms of cash needs. I do though, think that the industry lends itself well to venture. We're certainly backed by venture, and we would foresee quite a bit of our future growth. So for us, we'll grow with a blend of debt and venture because we throw off cash now, remarkable as that sounds, we generate cash in a location. So we see ourselves as being probably 60, 70 percent debt funded. So think asset financing type growth and then equity is the other part and private capital for that. So venture. There's an argument that might say, private equity could get there as well. Large private equity firms could get there too. But our ambition is to take the business public as soon as we can. That is a moving feast because public markets are, not in great shape, but by the time we get to that 50 to a hundred million run rate revenue, I think the right thing to do for a business like ours is going to be to IPO because of the profile of investor that's available there. The retail investor will be very important to us as well. The amount of capital we will need to raise to grow it, as I said, to be the leader is enormous. And so it's our ambition to float the company as quickly as we physically can. But I don't think that's in the next two years. It's probably from three years onwards, but there's, there is an outcome where we're floating this business in three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, as we wrap up, what are some of the things that you'd like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the most important thing is the audience to understand that the economics have now been proven for this space. The viability of it has been proven very clearly, that this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That's, that is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think. There has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us.

This technology of distributed electric propulsion systems and advanced flight control systems is revolutionary. And we must apply the evolutionary learnings that we have had over the last 120 years. And by doing so, in the thesis I lay out, you're helping to ground that base and think about, okay, let's not just run down the hill. Let's walk and make sure that we can cover all the aspects that we need to cover. Our air transportation industry is the safest mode of transportation in the world. And yet we still have some certainly surprises that occur in aviation safety and in the design of the vehicles, in the control systems. We've all seen them in recent times. And here, these are processes and aircraft that have been around for quite some time. So I just want to make sure that we stay grounded in that we don't just accept the fact that we've got this new technology and it's going to just work immediately and be safe because it's new tech. We've got to go through the processes and procedures and time, of use to bring this to a scalable solution for transportation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Welcome to a much anticipated return of David Stepanek, Executive Vice President, Chief Transformation Officer of Bristow. Few can offer a more seasoned, measured, practiced, realistic view of where advanced air mobility has been, is, and perhaps where it's going. For those who have taken a careful, realistic approach to advanced air mobility, this discussion is a confirmation of your smart approach. We've been so eager to have guests back for a second conversation. Because the earlier impressions and assumptions mature over time. And in some cases they hold true and in others, they evolve. Hearing how things have changed can be of great value to our listeners, OEMs, operators, as well as investors. We're particularly fortunate that David and team have taken the time to write A Philosophical Guide For Early Operations. As they have put their thoughts on paper, on how advanced air mobility should be carefully and properly deployed. David and Bristow have been early adopters, buyers, and implementers of the advanced air mobility so their initial and subsequent assumptions and realized outcomes, carry great weight. As David mentioned often throughout the guide in our talk, he believes that those who have experience in vertical flight and being experienced operators, have a particular edge in evaluating, deploying, and scaling advanced air mobility. So listen to David's summary of the guide his five point thesis and general observations, his discussion of health management and flight operational data to enhance and optimize safety, and David's thoughts on what early advanced air mobility assumptions have proved out according to plan and what has changed from what some had thought just a few years ago. Given how precient David and team were just a few years ago, perhaps we'll listen even more and how he views the future of advanced air mobility as well as its risks and opportunities. Additionally, perhaps we even be a bit more critical and circumspect of those who have an interesting idea, but don't really know how, or don't have experience in bringing tech to the aviation market. Many thanks to David for his return visit and an important and engaging discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with David Stepanek as you innovate and generate positive financial returns in The Vertical Space. David Stepanek became Bristow's Executive Vice President Chief Transformation Officer in March, 2021. In this role David is leading the transformation of Bristow by introducing the next generation of advanced air mobility aircraft and expanding Bristow's core business in new regions. Through David's efforts Bristow has forged strategic relationships with multiple advanced air mobility manufacturers, leveraging Bristow's 75 years of safety management and vertical lift operations. He participates in a variety of public speaking engagements related to advanced air mobility operationalization and overcoming the hype of advanced air mobility to bring it to reality. David previously served as Bristow's Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer responsible for Bristow's global operations, supply chain, and IT. Prior to joining Bristow, David held positions with PHI, including President of PHI's energy business, and PHI Americas. David started new carrier businesses for a Phi in Australia, Cyprus, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad. He also led PHI's acquisition of Helicopters New Zealand in 2017. He has held board positions with Cougar Helicopters and HeliOffshore the global safety focus association for the offshore helicopter industry. David spent 20 years at Sikorsky aircraft in a variety of leadership positions. Including technical support customer service and commercial sales. During this time with Sikorsky David sold and delivered the first commercial S-92 model helicopter and booked over a billion in commercial helicopter sales. David is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Hey, David, welcome again to The Vertical Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My pleasure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, David. So we're going to ask the same question as we did the beginning of the last podcast, as we do all podcasts. What, is something that very few in the industry agree with you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A majority of the folks in this industry, the companies in this industry don't agree with me that really cargo is the way to move first. And that pragmatic approach to it. And that's driven by business models that have been, The activity levels that have to happen in order to infer some of the, returns that their investors are going to expect. So they're moving forward with, more of a urban mobility or transportation model, in and around the cities. Notably, what's potentially gonna be happening with, in the Middle East, in the United Arab Emirate with several of the different, OEMs that are vertically integrated. And then also the, the potential with, airline transfers in the New York region first. So, I want them to be successful. I do. I, I think they're going to be faced with certain challenges, but for Bristow and for, I think the vast majority of the theses that we've laid out is that cargo transportation will, in a business to business model, is the approach early to allow us to scale to, the different, unique business models of, of both regional mobility and urban mobility. As we, transfer, through the next, next five to 10 years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, how is that controversial? I think a lot of people that I speak with would say cargo is likely to be one of the first. How would well-informed people disagree with you?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's the numbers of aircraft and the volume it's going to be relative to the top line, of the, of the company where cargo transportation can be smaller and profitable, but it won't drive the higher levels of revenue that has been expressed in, a number of different business models.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So David you are the first to return as a Vertical Space podcast guest. And there's a couple of reasons that, you are the first person to return. One is to discuss your new guide, The Philosophical Guide for Early Advanced Air Mobility Operations. And number two, let's face it, there are not many people who have led the community like you have with, with partnering with an awful lot of very prestigious organizations who are, leading the way in advanced air mobility. So, to be able to hear your thoughts expressed in the guide, but also expressed in, what you've seen over the last couple of years and what's changed. That's probably one of the most important thing is what's changed. So if you could just give us a little bit of an overview of the guide, an executive summary, because everybody should read it, but give us an executive summary of the guide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll do my best. First, I think I should probably outline why I decided to write the guide. it's somewhat unique in doing so, and when I was talking to some of the executives within Bristow while I was doing this, First of all, they were like, what are you doing here? are we going to lean into some of our intellectual property? Are we going to tell people exactly what to do and generate more competition? My response is that our stated vision is to be a leader in innovative and sustainable vertical flight solutions. And, and being a leader really means rising other people up as well and, being part of the process. So our core competencies is one of the values that we believe that Bristow brings to the advanced mobility space. And without divulging some of the secret sauces that we use to, to manage our core competencies, I wanted to express the philosophies that we use and that we've learned over the 75 years of operating helicopters and airplanes to this industry and why. And so that was That was part of it. The other is I outlined some observations that I've made and those are concerns. So there's these observations that I've made that are outlined in the guide, and I wanted to express that and, and then offer some potential solutions or at least thoughts on, on solutions. And the third part is really intersected the, the other two to be the impetus to get me to write down this was, I work with an executive coach I have for a decade, and I was discussing with him the thoughts that what we're doing, the thoughts, some of the challenges that I'm, we're, we're facing, some of the frustrations that I have in trying to, to relay the messaging that I want to get across in a very short time period, generally that we have with, whether we're working with governments or business people or investors, you get 15 or 20 minutes. It's hard to get a very complex. thought process or complex philosophy across in that. And he said, well, you're basically writing the book on this. And then he went, that's what you should do. You should write the book. So, I laughed and said, I'm a busy man. I don't have time necessarily to, write something that needs, that's as complex as this, and that would be as in detailed. He encouraged me to use a ghostwriter and I thought about that a little bit further. One of the things that I like to do when I'm on holiday or go on very long, multi day, hikes. So last summer I was on a hike in Spain and I had a few days to really think about it. And I put the outline in my brain and jotted it down and decided to write it myself over the Christmas holidays. And so those were the three real factors there. And then I wanted to lean on people that I work with and people that I've talked to, people that I respect that have maybe a different, viewpoint of whether it's aircraft certification or government relations or the real technical aspects of the advanced mobility space. So I leaned on a lot of people, three I mentioned as contributing editors, and, and they, they had a, real big input to, what you, you finally got to read. Richard Lapin is an expert in government relations and international relations. And he's worked with various governments around the world. Marc Poland is an old colleague of mine. He retired from Sikorsky a number of years ago. He was one of the first, if not the first program manager on the S-92 and brought that aircraft through certification and launch of commercialization. And then, Dr. James Wang, the professor at a university in Singapore, he built the first tilt rotor, eVTOL aircraft, Project Zero in 2011, which he showed me back then. So I was able to really lean on them and bring some of their concepts and ideas and thought processes in. And I felt like once we had it written in a draft format, it was something that a lot of people could utilize. And I didn't write it for technical experts and I didn't write it for the, necessarily the people that are deeply involved in advanced mobility, but this ecosystem is going to be very large. There are going to be a lot of people that have never worked in air transportation or transportation in general. There are going to be a lot of investors that are going to be thinking about coming into this space. Because the total available market is substantial and it's going to spread across the globe. There's be a number of hundreds of different companies that are going to start up. So the thought is we've got this great philosophy about how to bring aircraft into service and the things you need to think about specifically in vertical aviation. And hence I jotted it all down and it's really 40 years of, my experience and others.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As you read the guide, you can hear a couple of themes that are loud and clear. One is there was a lot of exuberance early on, and there was a lot of promise early on. And that, in some ways, your guide is a de risking. guide, isn't it? Here's a way to de risk your investment. Here's a way to de risk if you're an OEM. So give us a couple of the areas that you think somebody reading the guide would perhaps think differently than where they are today. Whether they be the OEM or whether they be an operator. Whether they be experienced in vertical lift or not.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, one of the things I hope to get across in this was that once these aircraft are type certified by an airworthiness regulator. That that's not the end. We don't just, now we have an aircraft that's certified and produced. It goes to a dealership or it goes into the market. And we just turn them on. Like we do an automobile. To operate these aircraft for hire, for service, or to provide service to, the public or governments, you're an airline, so recognize that, and that stems from, I presented it to, Smart Cities Conference a couple of years ago. And these are mega cities, very, very smart people that driving city planning with tens of millions of people in population with lots of different, infrastructure and logistics issues to deal with. And one of the comments that they came up with was that, this is just like buying an electric scooter or an electric car, I'm just going to put it into service and when I explained to them what's necessary to do that, it's, you're an airline and you have to abide by the rules. By, by the rules and regulations that drive the, the air transportation system. So that's one. The other is that it's not easy. So being an air carrier is not just I buy the best stuff or the best aircraft and I put it into service and I hired it. There's so much more that goes into the thought processes of, not just which aircraft you buy, but how you configure it for its purpose. What are the process and procedures that you're going to utilize for the missions that you've outlined for your business plan? And how do you impart your culture of safety throughout the entire organization? So that's a very difficult process. It's relatively easy to buy an aircraft. Takes capital. A lot of people can raise capital. It's a little harder, right? Process and procedures, but you can hire some of that too. So you can hire some experts and you can get a lot of things just right off the shelf. The hard bit is having a culture that, it's a very top of the leadership, which I believe in, most, if not all cases, leaders of organizations want everybody in their organization to be safe. How you manage that and how you make that happen is a little bit more difficult than just wanting it. So you've got to be, you've got to have it in your DNA. You've got to have it in the way that you lead, the way you present yourself and the rest of the leadership team throughout the organization. Cause at the top people want to be safe, leadership wants to be safe, and at the line level, they're the ones that are executing, they're the ones that are going to cut their fingers, they're the ones that are going to trip and fall, they're the ones that are going to get hurt. They obviously want to be safe too. It's in the middle where you have this drive. So if you could see like an hourglass where you're driving people for execution, you're driving people for profitability, you're driving people to meet schedules, How do you make sure that they're imparting the philosophies and beliefs of that company? That's the hard bit. So it's not just I snap my fingers, I buy an aircraft, I get an air operating certificate and I'm ready to go. There's so much more to it, and I believe, and what I impart in this philosophical guide, is that companies like Bristow, not necessarily has to be Bristow, but companies that have this experience over the years and have done it over time, can put these aircraft into service in a very limited case and share the information of operational inefficiencies or data or technical problems with the industry to help improve the safety. At the same time, we're demonstrating to the regulator, safe, efficient operations that will allow the expansion of different, into different businesses. And hopefully at the same time, we're proving out to the public where there's been certainly some disarray, if you will, if you think about the, issues that, that Volocopter has been faced with in Paris and, really the citizens not wanting that to be operated during the Olympics or in the city at all. We can turn this into a more normal mode of transportation through that process. And that will allow investors and entrepreneurs to do either invest in companies or raise the capital necessary with the data that's been produced by these early operations to allow this expansion of the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the topic of all the steps that an air carrier needs to go through in order to introduce a new type to their operations. In your guide, you mentioned that that can take between, 12 to 18 months. everything inclusive of training, supply chain planning, writing of the operating manuals, maintenance planning, et cetera, et cetera. To what extent can this be parallelized? Talk a little bit more how that integrates with the discussions that you're having with OEMs. And to what extent is this really a serial operation as opposed to parallel?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll speak to it in two categories. One is if, we were buying a traditional aircraft that's already been type certified and in service, where that's very much a parallel operation. Say you decide to buy a new type of aircraft for your operation, they've produced it before. You're running the training organization. You're writing of the manuals. You have known performance to deal with. So you can write that in parallel with it. For an aircraft that's not yet been type certified, it's a little more challenging because there could be some constraints that appear before certification process. And there also could be some regulatory shifts or training shifts and how you're going to operate. So you try to run that in parallel as much as possible. One to align with the allocation of capital to buy the aircraft and two to speed up the, in service time, but it's, it, there's likely going to be a lag. So it's going to, run somewhat in parallel and somewhat in series, for the early adoption. And one of the things I mentioned in the document is, and this is from experience, early adopters with the wherewithal, with the financial capability to withstand and be resilient to certain aspects, the capital that's being employed, potentially with some alternative solutions in case there's a problem. We tend to have a little bit more patience with an OEM and a regulator when we're challenged with different problems, whether it's a technical problem, a regulatory problem, something that's cropped up in the operations. So you've got to be able to work within that whole process. And that can in part can actually slow training down. It could slow the aspect of staying current with that particular aircraft, if you have a gap in operations for a month or two. So all those things you'll have to deal within, the early operations side of things. So if you build a business model to just go out full throttle straight away, every aircraft flies every day, we're not going to have any issues. I mean, you're really setting yourself up for some disappointment and potential issues.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A good chunk of the document also covered your thoughts on early operations. Can we spend some time talking about how your current view on early operations has changed over the years and, how you see the evolution of these early markets?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So back to the pragmatic approach, that's why I want to do something in a constrained environment with business to business operation. Because one of the unique, aspects of these vehicles, specifically the 100 percent battery electric aircraft, that's certainly nothing that we have to deal with the traditionally powered aircraft is, will likely take off at maximum or close to maximum gross takeoff weight to get the most performance we can out of these vehicles. We're also going to land at maximum gross takeoff weight, whereas traditional aircraft will be landing at a lighter weight because you've burned off the fuel, all those things. So that means we're really putting the maximum stresses on the aircraft at both takeoff and landing. The business models and the range capabilities of these vehicles are going to require multiple takeoff and landings a day. And so we don't understand, surely, through the certification, there'll be analysis that's done and there'll be margins put on the structural integrity of it. But I do think that we'll likely see issues that will hopefully be rectifiable, that we'll have to deal with on the structural side of things. I relay back to experience with traditional helicopters. As I reflected, I couldn't think of one aircraft that we put in the service early that did not have some sort of, a structural issue that we had to deal with, whether it's sponsons and landing gears, or the frames around the primary drive system, engine mounts. You tend to have, higher use cases and higher vibration message in operations than you would in flight test. And you might not see them in flight test, you may not have predicted that these things could happen, but, but they tend to happen in these different environments. So having that temperate environment with, average temperatures, moderate humidity, not a lot of rain and thunder and lightning. Those early operations will allow for that testing and as, as we put them in harsher environments, we're going to see other issues that are going to crop up with these machines and how we deal with them and how we have the resilience and wherewithal to deal with them and ensure that we have a business model that can withstand, the financial challenges that are going to be faced with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. One of the things that stood out, part of your theses is that early operations should be over low population, low density, airspace type of geographies. And just to make the conversation a little bit more interesting and spicy here, I'm going to poke some holes, but, intuitively, intuitively, this makes sense. But at the same time, the regulator will not allow a new type to fly unless they are convinced that the aircraft is safe to be integrated into the national airspace system and safe to be flown over, whatever geography it is, approved to fly over. And so, to make an analogy when, when Boeing or Airbus introduce a new airplane, they don't have a restriction as to what airports they can be flown in and out of. Now, granted, those are systems that are well understood and we have decades of operational data to understand them. But at the same time, it just feels like this, constraint of early operations might impose some, economic penalties early in the use cases where those are needed the most.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had a sense that this was going to raise some controversy. And the hypothesis is really around several different ideas, and it's not just about the concern over safety of that operation, the concern that you may have to land the aircraft in a, unplanned environment. That is part of it, but it's not all of it. The other part of our business model thesis is, that these vehicles early on should provide services and goods to services to areas that are in need of it, that have, poor road systems, poor transportation systems that need to have materials brought to them in a more efficient manner. So when I think about those environments, I'll give you a couple of examples. Scandinavia has geographical barriers, so you have a lot of fjords. You have great road systems, but they take lots of time to get to. You have some transportation on rail, but not a vast majority like you have in most of Central and Western Europe. And then there's places such as the northern territories of, Australia, there's places within continental United States that fit that as, as well, and, others. And, those also tend to be, and it may not seem intuitive, but the coastal areas of Scandinavia is somewhat temperate. We have very few icing days. It's close to our supply chain. So that was one of the reasons behind it is, is that we think that there's a really good economic business model for that particular mission, and it serves the purpose of isolating the system in case there is an issue, we can deal with it. So it wasn't just about trying to put a constraint around use case of these of these machines. It was really our philosophy that we had stated very early that we think is the is the right business case for it, whether it's the islands of Scotland or fjords of Norway or, pick another country that has similar characteristics. I think Japan's another really good example, even though you've got a great rail system, you've got a condensed population with very mountainous region with lots of, rugged coastline that, that needs to be supported.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you mind sharing maybe some details when you looked at some of these use cases, in terms of the size of this market opportunity, how that compares to the initial expectation of these aircraft being used for the commuter market, what's their relative size and, can OEMs really scale, as expected in those early use cases?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the latter part of your point is I think important to note because the scaling is, I believe it's not going to be at the peak levels that, we're talking about early. So the production levels I believe they're not going to hit some of the early projections. It's going to be in the 25 to 100 to 150 aircraft per year until you scale new production and you have to distribute the production facilities globally, if you, plan to, penetrate those markets. So we've done, I gotta be careful what I say here. there's, there's a lot of work that's being done. A lot of it's being done under a non disclosure agreement. but what we're looking at for, for these different regions in Scandinavia is potentially up to 50 aircraft. in service over a two year period that can generate, you can do the same math that, that some of the SPACs have been, have done it on. There's potential two to two to three million revenue per aircraft in that space. Not all of them will work every day. It is a nice market. It is a market that potentially could provide very good returns to the operator and the other people that are in investors in that process and will provide, the necessary data for the scaling, both in production and implementation into different mobility factors, whether it's regional passenger carrying and, or, into the urban side of things. The other part of that aspect with this. early adoption of cargo transportation is you're utilizing existing infrastructure. So there's not, necessarily a requirement to go out and invest heavily in concrete. Or heavily in ground facilities. There will be investments that will be necessary in, the charging networks that'll have to be put in place. There'll be some other investments in there as well with ground handling equipment and tooling. But not to the scale of having to build a 25 or 30 million VertiPort and going through the whole process of the real estate investments that are necessary for it early on. If it works, if these aircraft are viable, safe, efficient, and reliable, that will provide the data for the investment thesis that are going to be necessary for the substantial amount of capital that's going to have to flow into the, investment of infrastructure, real estate development, air traffic management, communication systems, all the things that are necessary. And then the other reason for the remoteness side of it is many of the the big airports in the big cities, they're very close or at capacity. So you'll hear things from certain city planners or airport planners. It's like, Oh, great. We'd love to have UAM in here, but just don't add any more airplanes to my system. I can't handle it. Whereas in these remote locations, you've got airports that are screaming for help. That are, that want this, to come in so they can actually build out a process which should potentially create, create new\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>jobs. So, Dave, if we take this Scandinavian network as an example, what would you see the utilization of those 50 aircraft in that network being and how would it compare to what has been circulated in the community as to the urban air mobility or the airport transfer use case? How do those compare to each other and what are the pros and cons in your mind?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some of the work that is cargo movements are in belly cargo today. So they're somewhat constrained by whatever the capacity of the aircraft is, depending on how many passengers they're utilizing, and what the payload available is. And then of course the commercial schedule. And then the other aspect is you're replacing lorries and trucks, depending on which part of the world you're in. As far as, utilization goes so analysis is done. It's at this point in time, it's a guess, what are we going to get for reliability? What's the backup requirements? What's the maintenance schedule? We don't, know those information yet, if you look at it, a helicopter operation, the maximum utilization we tend to get on a per tail number or per serial number aircraft is about 90 percent. So you say you take a 12 hour day. 90 percent of the time, we can get a helicopter going. To get to a higher utilization, you have to employ more capital and have additional assets in place for backups. In the helicopter world, it's a much more intense amount of capital than you see in fixed wing aircraft. So you know, it's not, I think it's a, it's not unusual for a company, ultra, low cost carrier with hundreds of aircraft that maybe have three or four backups. I don't know what the big carriers carry. So to get to that rate will take more capital. And that's what we'll be planning in a certain number of technical backups to support maintenance operations and downtime for technical capabilities. And what we've learned in the helicopter operation is that with the proper amount of, technical backup, we can get up to 99 percent utilization rate. And then if that's measuring dispatch utilization, and then now you got to talk about what's the utilization of the payload capabilities, of the, of the asset,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the number of flights\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>and the number of, number of, number of flights, then, and really that's going to be relative to the performance of the aircraft, the hazards which you need to mitigate. We're again, just building early schedules out, but we're, we're thinking about six hours of operation on a daily basis is, about the right way to start somewhere between six and eight hours. So you're taking into account whether you have to have additional crew, fatigue, risk management, the, turnaround time, what you have to download, if there's information to be downloaded, the charging side of things, there's six to eight hours of, of daily utilization should, should suffice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the absence of operational data, where do you find the basis to ground your assumptions as to the level of interest and how you prioritize these early use cases?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you want to go somewhat of a, the art of war, go where your enemy's not, or go where it's easy to penetrate, the market. So there are certain just jurisdictions in the world that are willing to, work with what they might call a sandbox operation to prove some of these theses out. So potentially taking aircraft, even in a pre certification role, in a limited case of scope, and doing actual commercial operations for it, so proving out that process. getting potentially some, PSO routes. And some other things, that could help support the, the economics of it. And then there's the sustainability aspect and then the potentially the economic aspect. And I think, sorry, go back to one of your first questions about what, other people don't agree, agree on is that, I, a lot of people are pushing the sustainability side and it's very important but the economic model and the cost structure of this has to work first. Otherwise, it's just, it's going to be a difficult process. So that's the grounding of it. So we're, I, I've spent a lot of time and my colleagues have spent a lot of time working with, within different networks, in government, working at different airport authorities, and different logistics companies and energy and industrial companies that are, are really keen to, to give this a try and, and see if it works. And that's why, again, back to the, earlier show, invest as little capital as possible, do it with an operation that has existing infrastructure to prove it out so we can scale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you feel that you've properly expressed your five point thesis? We've nibbled at it, but if you could just rattle off the five.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So my five theses are that early stage AAM operations should focus on a business to business model, a commercial model, that support a logistics network that's potentially already in place, and that you do that within a 20 to 60 kilometer range. That's the first part. Second thesis is that advanced mobility commercial operations will be required to be conducted by a licensed air carrier. So you're effectively an airline and particularly in the early stages our thesis is that, that airline should have some experience in vertical lift and in safety management to be the most efficient to doing so. Third thesis is that early stage AAM operations are best conducted by companies experienced in purchasing and configuring aircraft for their intended uses. AAM manufacturers would be best advised to work with these companies to ensure that the, the product that they're developing is commercially viable and, and we'll be able to be used by the use cases. And, and, and, and the genesis of that thesis is that there'll be equipment and use cases that are necessary that don't necessarily be, need to be part of a type certification. So aircraft that are type certified don't necessarily have to have an enhanced ground proximity warning system or a TCAS. But they're certainly needed for fit for purpose for certain operations. And then fourth thesis is early AAM operations should be conducted by air carriers using existing infrastructure with a willingness to collaborate with potentially new companies in order to share data that is not necessarily commercial but operational and safety to allow the AAM business to scale on a global basis. And that fifth thesis is that air carriers involved in AAM operations should have the appropriate equipment. processes, programs, and people in place to manage both the health and flight data that we're going to derive from these vehicles. And that in part will also allow a shorter timescale to do some of these early testings that I philosophize around learning that process of having more data than we ever had on any other aircraft will allow us to crunch that data, aggregate it, and understand the health of the vehicle in a much faster pace. So I think that by utilizing that data, you could accelerate into different and newer commercial models that, will potentially substantiate some of the financial theses that have been put forth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dave, so you lay out the rationale for these theses in the document, but if you were to sum it up for the audience, what is the theme running in the background through your thinking that led you to create these theses? I mean, it strikes me as an approach that is grounded in a more realistic, and experienced view of what operations are actually like, and brings that into the conversation. But, in your words, what are the underlying themes behind your conclusions that you create in these points?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, I want to say that, I'm absolutely optimistic about advanced air mobility and all the potential use cases of it. And I believe that optimism is a force multiplier. So I want to get that out, Chris, because there is certainly a grounding. And some people could see this as pessimistic, or some people could say this as, I have a poor view of some of the early operations that may occur outside of my thesis. So I'm very optimistic about it. But behind it is something that I talk about early on is we're at a revolutionary point in aerospace. This technology of distributed electric propulsion systems and advanced flight control systems is revolutionary. And we must apply the evolutionary learnings that we have had over the last 120 years. And by doing so, in the thesis I lay out, you're helping to ground that base and think about, okay, let's not just run down the hill. Let's walk and make sure that we can cover all the aspects that we need to cover. Our air transportation industry is the safest mode of transportation in the world. And yet we still have some certainly surprises that occur in, aviation safety and in the design of the vehicles, in the control systems. We've all seen them in recent times. And here, these are processes and aircraft that have been around for quite some time. So I just want to make sure that we stay grounded in that we don't just accept the fact that we've got this new technology and it's going to just work immediately and be safe because it's new tech. We've got to go through the processes and procedures and time, of use to bring this to a scalable solution for transportation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, in some ways, you're very blatant about it in your guide, but what you're basically saying is bringing technology to aviation is hard.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's super\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And for those of you who, I'm putting a little bit of a shameless plug in for our companies, because this is one of the things we understand, and this is how we help our customers. But it's hard. And for those of you who have not worked in bringing technology to market in aviation, there are so many hurdles that you can't anticipate. And just because you certified your plane, you have so many other things to consider. We all read what we want to read, right? But that really popped out from your guide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, thanks. I mean, that's, that's, that's really the, the gist of it. I, it is hard. What every one of these, entrepreneurs and designers and the OEMs are doing is super hard. Getting an aircraft to type certification is super hard, super expensive. And now you've got an aircraft type certified that you've been thinking about for five or six years and working on getting it designed. And then technology's advancing beyond your certification base. So you've got to work on catching that back up and this loop there. And then now you've got type certified. Now you've got to build it. You've got to build it in a manner that's reflective of the type certification in a repeatable way, in a high quality way which takes another couple hundred million dollars to build out a facility to get to the production levels that are going to be necessary for this to scale. And I think it's brilliant that many of these companies are leaning on automotive because I do think that that's what this is going to look like long term production. But building aircraft on automotive model, it's a different way of, of things. And I was sharing a story today with one of the OEMs, about an aircraft that's been in our, this aircraft, this is public information. We had an accident of a, of an aircraft two years ago, about a year and a half ago, actually. And, and what it was, was it was an installation defect that happened 11 years ago. The aircraft's been in service for 11 years and the defect finally materialized. And if not for the great coordination of our aircrew, it would have been a very catastrophic event. But the team was able to analyze what had occurred and manage the process and land the aircraft safely, albeit with a little bit of damage. So these are just, it's really hard stuff. And getting to repeat on a large scale of aircraft production, a helicopter manufacturer today on a very good year is doing maybe 50 to 60 aircraft a year. we're talking about that in a month now, or even more at scale. So how do you ensure that repetitiveness? How do you ensure that quality system throughout the hundreds of people that are going to, or, or even the people that be programming the robots to install it, all that's going to be a big challenge. So now you got to produce, and then you got to get it, get an airworthiness certificate on and get it to an operator or operate it yourself. Which also lends itself to a very difficult process. One, to convince yourself safe, efficient, reliable, convince your local regulator so you can get it on your operation specifications and ensure you have the aircraft fit for purpose to meet the mission and the environment that you want to run your commercial program on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay so based on these observations, what do you think about the aircraft OEMs that want to have that vertically integrated business model and also be the operator? What are the pros, cons, or implications of your observations on that path forward for a company?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's going to take a lot of capital. My first view, it's going to take a tremendous amount of capital, more capital than they would have if they were going to be a traditional OEM. And it's another step that's harder. So if you're a traditional OEM, you're part of two processes, potentially two processes, type certification, support of that type certificate and production. And now you're adding back in the third portion of, of the difficult processes of operating it and the complexities and the core competencies to operate and build are very, very different. I understand why some of the companies want to do it, specifically in the United States, and I believe that their business model makes sense to them, and I think they're going to be successful early on, and I want them to be successful early on. I've had discussions with both of them that are in a more vertical mode. Their success is going to hinge on a lot of the future successes of this industry because they'll be some of the early adopters. I do think it's a challenge to the business model and that they may have to, shift some of their thinking. And I think you're seeing some of that with each of them doing more international sales and partnering with a variety of different organizations. But in the other cases, you're somewhat of an homogenous society, if you think about it in that way, where you're the entire ecosystem and you have control of that, but you're also the entire ecosystem when something goes wrong your complete economic model shuts down no matter where you are in that process. So if you have a technical problem that you have to deal with over a certain period of times, both your production is in disarray or could be, in jeopardy and you're not flying, so you're not collecting any revenue at all. And there's no alternative for you because you don't have different, sources of, transportation. Whereas traditional operators such as ours, one of the reasons we have a variety of different partnerships with the OEMs is, it's our experience that we will have technical problems and we will need to use alternative aircraft that may not be the most fit for one when there's other problems with those vehicles. So, there's certainly that risk associated with it. That's what I see, but I, again, I do think that they've raised enough capital and that they can get through this process and get the aircraft into their operation.

I'm sure that somebody reading the guide might say, look, this really sounds like an incumbent that is trying to protect their position when faced with a wave of new entrants, right? Because, throughout the document, there are hints at how only current established air carriers have the, experience and the wherewithal and the competencies to pull this off and introduce these new aircraft. And so one thing that stood out as I was reading it is your comment that no matter how dedicated to the concept of mission, a company cannot set policies and fully understand and manage the risk and assurance of running air operations. This is a quote, without the experience that comes from being an air carrier. So what does that say about the landscape of emerging air carriers? Are you making a statement that all the future air carriers for these vehicles already exist today? Is it reasonable entrants? How's that going to play out?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely reasonable and expected and required because we can't all operate. across the globe. So you're a regional air carrier. Bristow itself is a global regional air carrier. We operate in 17 countries, 17 is all right. There's a lot more countries in the world than 17 where they'll have all their own regulations. They're going to need their own startup companies. They're going to need their own processes and procedures to do this. My thesis is that they can learn from us and we are willing to share that information. and collaborate to allow this to scale globally. The thesis is we think that it's best to start with us and this information can be discriminated quickly because we'll have so much data from the health of the aircraft and the flight data, and potentially some of the business constraints that we'll have to deal with, to allow that, that scaling, on a global basis. So that's why I say in one of the theses they must be willing to collaborate. So this is really a thing. We want to be a leader. We want to be a leader because we want a great business. We also want to be a leader because we think this is necessary for the sustainability of transportation, it's necessary for this new revolution of, of aerospace and technologies that are being applied. We think that we start with these eVTOLs, we start with these eSTOLs, and that the propulsion systems and the power systems and, the energy sources are going to get us to a point where this is a much broader transportation network. We can put it on a larger equipment, potentially even, transatlantic flights someday or transpacific intercontinental flight someday. So the, it starts here and companies like ours with that experience can help get that started. That's, that's the thesis behind it. And there's plenty of really great people out there that have that experience that can move around the companies or could come in and help with that technology for those startups as well. That it's not just that you have to be the company, but that team that you put together will need that experience or the lessons learned and we think that's one of our duties to this industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, as people have reviewed the guide for you before you published it, what's been some of the tougher questions they've asked you, or the challenges you've heard on the guide that you'd want to share with the audience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we spent two weeks deciding whether a takeoff was a noun or an adjective with a preposition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you can imagine who that was with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Alright.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, some of the review is exactly what some of the points that you've put out, specifically Luka that are you just trying to ring fence this business? I mean, this is going to be so large. The total market If successful early is massive. And there's no way that we would even want to ring fence that. So we, we think we can create our business on our attributes and that we think that we should help things. So there was that concern of the ring fencing. There was a tremendous amount of debate about, I did use some stronger languages in some of the early drafts about should or must. Or shall and must. so that, some of that, that came out. we got a little bit more detailed in the types of advanced air mobility aircraft, laying that out. I was a little concerned about being too technical. And then there's been a really great reception of the portions on safety management and data collection and how it's aggregated. I had a fireside chat at the Revolution Aero conference today. There was quite a few questions about what the data should look like. Who owns it? How does it work? How would you manage it? And I, my words were if an OEM or a major supplier that's managing the aircraft data doesn't want to share that information and aggregate it and work with the operators to ensure that we set appropriate thresholds, that we have algorithms to detect anomalies that we learn and that we have actions that come out of these measurements, that I'm, we're not really interested in, in working with those organizations. So back to collaboration. I think we, we all have to collaborate to get this started and get it going.

So we've been operating helicopters for 70 years, 60, 70 years. And we finally got around to putting a proper organization together to manage that. And speaking with the gentleman who runs Heli Offshore, and I was a former board member of Heli Offshore, if we had a chance to start at the very beginning, just imagine what we could have accomplished. So here's an opportunity. We have a clean sheet of paper. We have a very good template. And even, recently the Royal Aeronautical Society published a paper of kind of three issues that could potentially happen. They outlined pseudo accidents and what could occur, and they even mentioned the fact that having an organization such as Heli Offshore will help, mitigate, potential issues and accidents. That we have that information. Somebody has an information that needs to be shared because we're going to see different problems across the globe you'll have, and you may even see similar problems. For instance, somebody's an inspector's out there looking at an aircraft. They notice there's something wrong with the propeller. And it's delaminated, and it's delaminated in this section.

One, the numbers of aircraft will be substantially more. These are aircraft that are primarily going to be flown VFR, in low altitude space, so it's going to be having that assurance that the aircraft are being operated as the operation specifications and the company wants it to be operated in. I think it's going to have a greater impact on the industry. And then also it's interesting. You think about health and usage systems as a way to mitigate certain cost structures and improve the product reliability. but FOQA also comes into play here where you may see, even though it's, it's within the specifications of the aircraft or maybe within the operation specifications, you may see some use cases where you're wearing out wheels and brakes, and one base may be wearing out wheels and brakes at a higher pace than another. And when you look at FOQA, you can determine what's happening and potentially, mitigate that. So there's some, there's some really interesting, and this is an experience that I've had is there's some interesting economic benefits beyond just the assurance that the aircraft is being operated in a safe manner. And it's going to be also very important to play back into the training organization. And with the technologies we have today to replay in simulators and to replay in three dimensional models, it's going to help the new line pilots and the new engineers coming into play to learn some of the, lessons learned and see actual flights that have transpired, but it's also vital that FOQA is non punitive, unless there was a willful misconduct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, sure. David, given your guide, given you learned over the last couple of years, what would you have done differently at Bristow?

We are, I think, an early adopter, but on the scale of things, a lot was happening pre the merger of Bristow, so we really couldn't have done it. But there was quite a bit of work that had been done with the legacy, the pre merger era team. Mostly data collection and some discussion. So getting in earlier, maybe applying more human resources to it. We wanted to be very careful in, nascent business. We still, especially in 2021, weren't sure what's this was going to look like. It was a tremendous amount of capital flowing in. So I think applying a little bit more resource to it, I think would have, would have perhaps accelerated our processes. On the latter part of your question, I'm very pleased with all the companies that we've dealt with. It's difficult right now to say, because there's, there's really some other interesting products that are being developed and some interesting entrepreneurs that I just have to say to them, it's not you, it's me. We are at our capacity of our team. We're a very small team by design which allowed us to be somewhat flexible. So, having a little more resources could potentially have allowed us into different markets. The other aspect, and this was a question from the first discussion we had, because there was a lot of discussion about the drone market. Maybe entering or thinking about that a little bit more on a scaled basis. I still believe that for us to start a commercial drone business on our own is going to be difficult because of the nature of our cost structure and in the size of our business and the flexibility that small startups will have, they'll have the advantage there in the cost structure, but you know, working in a better way with, with some of the leaders in drones and cargo delivery on the drone side, I think would have been something that, but we're, we're somewhat into it now. There's been a partnership made with one of the, one of the big players that I'm really proud of. We're going to be doing some work with them, proving out certain operations and potentially doing concept of operations for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm glad you raised this because I was going to ask you how an organization like Bristow might think about using UAS of various payload capacities from a couple of hundred pounds to maybe a couple of tons even, to execute on the mission like you described in Scandinavia or Northern Australia, and thinking a little bit differently about, the movement of cargo in general, that's optimized, with these kinds of vehicles in mind that are cheaper to operate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Well, we certainly are thinking about that and that's in our portfolio with, Elroy Air Chaparral, you have a vehicle hybrid electric system, automatic loading and loading of the payload, the pod, capabilities of putting different payloads into the pod, including surveillance equipment and things that are necessary for coastal surveillance or whatever you happen to be doing and doing those operations, as you mentioned, in, in places like Australia, Alaska, Norway. There's a, an energy company in Norway that's been testing out some operations beyond visual line of sight long distance. They want a 200 kilo payload to support their energy, business to hot shot parts out. They've done the economic model. They understand what being able to get those parts in a fashion they can with a drone versus a helicopter or a boat, which is most cases they use, and they can increase the uptown of their rigs materially. We're talking millions of dollars a month of change of production earnings or, cost shutdown issues that they deal with. But that's actually absolutely our business thesis of using those size drones. For that, when I talked about, I was talking about the little one, little, littler ones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are those conversations like internally? What are the considerations when you think about adopting something that is a bit of a departure from your core competence? As you enter that gray zone, what are you comfortable, what do you fear the most? Shine some light, to our audience about those boardroom level discussions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So some are at the boardroom and some are really at the operational level. So as I mentioned earlier, we do operate, drones for His Majesty's Coast Guard, but that is a government organization. It's not a type certified aircraft. It's not a commercial license to do it because we can do it for public service. Operating a piloted aircraft, we do that, we understand it, we know how to do it, we've got licenses to do it. Going into a remotely piloted aircraft beyond visual line of sight, which we have core competencies in that business, but translating that into a commercial side is something that's not necessarily one of our core competencies. So what the fear is, what would it cost? What would it, how long would it take? Should we partner with, another organization that has some of those core competencies already and we could help some of the weaknesses that they may have, market access, working with energy companies, sort of things. Hence an early kind of discussion with one of them that's doing that. So that's a way to mitigate it. We're still going to be measuring whether we should do it ourselves, whether we need a separate, whatever jurisdiction we have in, do you have a separate operating certificate for that? Or do you put it onto your current commercial operating certificate? What are the risks associated? If you have a problem in the advanced air mobility side, how would it affect the traditional helicopter model? If you're on the same certificate, do we separate that? That's all the work that we're doing today, in terms of our roadmap to operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you look at that remotely piloted operation that you would be flying, how does it differ from the way the Department of Defense might be flying the same platform?

But I will say that operating an aircraft to an oil rig or to a platform, and working for an energy company, comes with a lot more responsibility, a lot more requirements that they would put on that I believe that the military wouldn't necessarily apply in the general operation processes. The requirements for mitigating liability, limitations of the liability, insurance processes, consequential damages. If you bang up an oil platform, that's producing 10, 000 barrels of oil a day. Do the math. That's a pretty heavy liability.

We also use satellite downlinks and uploads to know position of the aircraft on a repetitive basis. It repeats about every 10 to 15 seconds and then they'll have some push to talk capabilities there. So it's a bit of a mixed bag depending on the flight and the location and, and whether they're flying in IFR conditions or not.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I wanted to get your thoughts on how our audience should be thinking about the market size of the mission set that you are putting forward in this document as the lowest risk path for scaling up. I believe that it's big. There are billions of people living in remote areas that need things. And there are lots of different applications, but it's not as conceptually obvious to the broader audience in terms of the scale of that as compared to the story around UAM and the things that this industry has raised a lot of capital on over the last few years. So you're close to it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:04:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:04:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How do you communicate that?

So what markets are we in today and what is the size of that prize and what is our right to win it? So on a total available market, and I'm going to go to this analysis that was done by a very reputable firm, by 2035. we think on the cargo market size of, of it is approximately 60, 000 aircraft, potentially, total market globally, cargo, same basic numbers for both urban and regional mobility side of it. So, you're thinking about a potential market size of 120, 000 aircraft. 2035 and beyond, maybe that's getting pushed down a little bit further. For Bristow, and, and back to the theses here, because that was the basis, some of those theses were the basis of the work that we did to narrow that market down to, potential market for our company, and then what that size of the prize is and what's our right to win it. And then when we narrow it down to specific markets that meet our thesis. And this has been put in some of our public information and we've talked this with analysts. That is the industrial model, so working with our current industrial customers and potential some middle mile cargo transportation systems and logistics networks. The other part is pure regional mobility cargo transportation, supporting a network perhaps in Northern Europe and other places. And then the third is back to using our core competencies and white labeling for a large 121 carrier to provide airport transportation. So we see those as the initial markets and within the scope of our theses, of course, industry cargo first, then moving into the potential passenger markets. We think that for Bristow, on a top line basis, by 2030, 2031 is somewhere between, I gotta be careful what I say here, I don't know how to put any forward looking statements, but a sizable material market for the business. On hundreds of aircraft. I mean, it is public that we have placed orders for approximately 450 odd aircraft with the different, equipment manufacturers. We have put in capital now with some of those manufacturers, cause they've hit certain milestones in their processes. So we're on the road to doing that. We're looking at potential additional milestones met by this year. And we also believe that there's a potential that we could operate a small scale, electric aircraft, sometime this year or early next, and then potentially on the cargo side, early next year. Early aircraft in 2025.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, how has the market changed from two years ago?

Another thing that surprised me is I had expected more exits from the industry or consolidation. I was very pleased to see the Joby XWing consolidation. I'd like to potentially see more of that. There's just not enough capital that's going to be available for investment to meet this, the size of all the companies that are trying to enter into this market. So we're going to have to see that scale down. So I did expect more exits. I was somewhat surprised early on by Volocopter's, issue with the German government not being able to get the loan guarantees. I think that as the early investors, the SPACs have been done, the private equities coming, and it's not necessarily going to be there. You're going to need more government support, specifically the European companies. Whereas in the United States, I think that's the, Air Force program has helped really substantiate and validate the, equipment and provided a level of some revenue to support their operations. Those are the big surprises for me. I guess some people may say, are you not surprised by some of the delays in certification? I'm certainly not. We've built our models around potential aircraft moving out to the right. I also, and I said this today at Revolution Aero, it's not just the aircraft certification that's going to get delayed, but in my entire history of buying aircraft and delivering aircraft as a salesperson, I can't think of too many times we actually did it on time. There are always delays. People have robust schedules. They put them in place. So you have to build that resilience. So I'm certainly not surprised by the delays. I'm encouraged by it. I've also been encouraged by the latest, Advisor Circular that the FAA published recently, that aligns more with the EASA and gives some better direction on the vehicle certification and some of the other aspects of it. So not surprised, but very happy to see that. Really changes in the organization, no consolidation, no major exits to speak of, as surprised me for sure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What technology OEM operator has been the most significant positive surprise in the last year or so?

They are developing some vehicles, Lockheed is certainly, and Lockheed's an investor in a few others, but I've been surprised to not see them either make an acquisition and or announce a major development in this space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any change to advice you'd give to entrepreneurs that you gave, in your last podcast?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I'd stick with picks and shovels. I would stick with that. I think that's still important. Make deals with, at this point in space, if you want to get into, into this space, I would, think about how you can be a supplier to the industry, the OEMs. And then a little later, well, in line with that, the drone deliveries and the beyond visual on a slide is accelerating. I think there's really good opportunities there for entrepreneurs that are willing to step into that space. And that's something I think you can do. And then others that are willing to maybe wait a little bit longer, infrastructure investment. Infrastructure in real estate, infrastructure in communication, navigation systems, in data processing and data aggregation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I know that you've listened to a lot of our podcasts.

I find it very informative and I always believe that you learn by listening to people that are smarter than you. And, everybody on, on your podcast generally smarter than me. my favorite is going to be John Langford. For personal reasons, one, I, I think that, one, he's within our portfolio and, one of the companies that we're really, hopeful for with Electra. Aero. Two, he's just a force of this industry with such a proven track record, and he's also influenced many of your other podcast people that have been on. They've either worked with him or worked for him within his team. And he's really spread his knowledge across the industry that, it's difficult to replicate and absolutely necessary. So I view as somebody that I would love to be able to emulate in any way, shape, or form. So hearing him speak about not what he's, just not what he's doing about this AAM industry, but is what he's doing potentially for STEM operations and his investments in things to get young people interested in aviation.

So if you can create that chaos and use that to your advantage or the threat of that chaos, I think that's a really good deterrent and that's what led us to found Firestorm with the idea of democratizing the sky.

I think, I have a very strong take on, where, counter drone is going, and I don't think that a lot of the solutions that have been funded or fielded today are going to work, I think, in, like, literally months or a year. So that's probably where the biggest disagreement in this field comes from. I think if you're asking me domestically versus globally, I think domestically people still think that, now if we're going to talk about drones, that what we've built for the last 20 years is going to work just fine. And when you actually talk to people overseas, they need a totally different type of drone because we're now fighting in environments that have massive jamming capabilities. So that's a two part answer to your question.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cool, and we'll explore both of those, but just as a bit of a teaser, what counter UAS technologies specifically do you think are, not overhyped, but given probably too much credit and likewise, what are the methods that you think really are promising?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm going to answer the second part first and say, I don't know a lot of stuff that is promising right now, because I think the world has changed so fast in the last year that we've not caught up to the reality that, most FPV drones, right? We'll call them$1,000,$2000, whatever you want to say,a lot of them are now have basically a terminal guidance chip that's put on them for 50 bucks that once you figure out what you want to hit, a yellow box comes around and you hit go and you let go of the drone, right? And so even if you're jamming it, it's going to go run into what it sees. And that's just a fundamental change that has happened. And, you know, these things move fast, so if you're talking audio or, optical, maybe you have at max six to seven hundred meters at max, and that's probably in a quiet environment. or a non busy environment. there's not a lot of those out there in the world, right? It's one thing if you're on a FOB in the middle of northern Iraq, it's another thing if you're fighting in kind of a ruined village in Ukraine. So, I think the future is going to be kinetic or it's going to be EMP based. Those open massive sets of, other problems in the counter UAS space, and we can dive more into this, but like, shooting bullets at a drone or shooting projectiles at a drone when you miss, you have to now think about collateral damage in a way you don't have to with like, RF or spoofing or hacking. I think those three areas are going to have a lot of trouble. RF, spoofing and hacking. One from an encryption standpoint, two because the Ukrainians and Russians are literally hopping between channels and signals depending on what the electromagnetic environment looks like. And then three, because one, people are actively building some really interesting non spoofing technology and I think that you're going to see a ton of SATCOMs come into this or drone over LTE, which opens an either larger can of worms, as far as like, what are we okay, either one violating from a privacy standpoint or two disrupting from just a fundamental usability of all the electronic systems we use in our life standpoint.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in a peacetime environment, certainly huge Fourth Amendment consequences Okay well how about we dive right in this Counter UAS theme For those who don't know, you founded Citadel back in the day.

And I literally Google searched what was out there and then wrote a patent on an airplane flying back from Boston after the Patriots head of security told me that, like, they're not just at the practice field now, so they think it's other teams spying, but they're, like, coming into games, and I was like, okay, now I've heard this from enough people where this is something we should go after. I am not an RF technologist. I really didn't know what I was getting myself into. I put together a really good team and, we basically used a very cool algorithm we've built, to detect and then mitigate drones and that's what we got. When we started, it was simply just like, find the drone, find the controller and attack it. And what we didn't know at the time was that for how much of a security threat drones bring to public infrastructure, the laws were not going to change anytime soon to interfere with the drone or to jam a signal. And that, there's kind of two groups and one of them has to ask permission from the other group to use that type of technology domestically. So we by accident became a defense contractor when Naval Special Warfare found us end of 2015, early 2016, when ISIS was using DJI drones and modifying them much like the Ukrainians and the Russians are today, to legitimately own the airspace from 500 feet and below in the conflict in Northern Iraq and Syria. Like, they owned it. and they had drone factories where they were modifying them to have servo motors to drop bombs. They were using them to coordinate the vehicle based IED attacks, artillery, RPGs, like everything. They were their ISR and little bomber drones, right? They're a true multi mission,$500 system. What Naval Special Warfare told us is they tried to repurpose a bunch of the jammers that were on the trucks for the roadside based IED stuff, and it wasn't working. So they were desperate to try and find new stuff. And, I think they were, we were one of the first handful of companies that were out there. Another prominent one here in San Diego is SkySafe. They're still around. But we got that first contract. We got, VC, and they invested in us, and, we then had the time and the money to really build out the technology into what it is today. I'll say, we didn't know how to sell to the federal government, right? And so, Luka, I think I've said this to you multiple times. It was like getting punched in the face every day until you learn how to maneuver in this area. And eventually you hire the right salespeople who actually understand how to sell in this area, to one, you know, build the hype train around the product. And we had and have. Probably the best RF counter UAS system in the world. it's a SOCOM program of record. But we also didn't understand how the game works. We didn't understand you got to be going to DC. We didn't understand you got to go win the Labs, right? Like, there's just a formula for how to do this. We didn't understand that. And so I think you saw from 2015 to 2017, maybe four or 500 counter UAS companies started in that first wave. We had a customer where we provided excellent customer support. They liked what we were doing, they liked our vision, and we made some really crucial technical hires that dramatically brought down our false positive rate and then increased the ability for us to interdict a drone without bringing down other Wi Fi systems. Which allowed us to gobble up parts of that market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What was novel about your technology? Why did yours work where others didn't work in the past?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'd say, you know, and you could ask any of the founders or a lot of the team that's still there today. The company was acquired by, Blue Halo at the end of 21 right before we became Program Of Record, it's small, okay? A lot of counter US systems are really big. It has what I would say is the best user interface in the entire industry. It is so simple to use and set up that an 18 year old kid could figure it out. I mean, and maybe they're better with technology, but you could say maybe a 50 year old person who's never really touched the system. How's that? Maybe that's a better analogy, right? And then the two other things are we invested very heavily in our AI team and we had a really good data pipeline and training approach that allowed us to remove false positives, right? Build a more robust model to match a drone signal in a very noisy RF environment. And then we built some proprietary kind of amplification technology and integrated in there. One that let us rapidly move between channels to step on, the signals, and two kind of increased power from what you could just buy, if you need to make noise on a drone signal or channel, for without, like, without what's available, on market today. So does that kind of give you a good idea for why we're, it's easy use. It's correctness and identifying things. we talked about this idea at the time called the Hunter algorithm, where we built this algorithm that would be able to see a drone when it comes out of a box before anyone else did that. And to this day, it's pretty amazing. you talk to guys who are still there and they're like, yeah, new drone comes on the market. The machine already knows it's a drone, right? it's pretty cool. So I think that, that really helped. And, we kept our BD team pretty small. And that's something where we'll, when we talk about Firestorm in a minute, like it's really easy to go spend a lot of money on marketing and BD. And we kind of had to go all in on defense because we didn't think commercial was going to happen. And there's a couple of companies out there like Dedrone that have raised unimaginable amounts of money and they're going after those markets. And I don't think as we see wave two right now, unless there's like a massive attack that you're going to see a change.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If we think back to those early days of the market that you're describing right now, 2015 ish timeframe, commercially available drones were rather, the fleet variety was not obviously at the level of today. And so it was arguably easier to build RF libraries for these drones to then go and counter. And for the most part, the radio links that they relied on were based on the highly proliferated electronics coming from China, that operated in ISM bands, not really encrypted, no frequency agility. It was a, good old dumb radio quote unquote. And so those early RF detection mitigation efforts worked fairly well. But, and by the way, from what we hear in Ukraine, there's still, those kinds of early,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They're there.

But, but, but the threat is changing, the attacker is getting more sophisticated in terms of frequency agility, deception, spectral awareness. This, move counter move, dynamic is evolving to the point Electronic Warfare of the past is no longer good, especially if you're facing, as we mentioned before, low, fast, erratic moving, break line of sight type of drones. And so when you project that arc of evolution on the drone side even further, what do you think EW 2. 0 looks like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Good question. I want to add a little bit of context to that story you just told, and I think it's actually really important for like, why we're in this situation today. When we started Citadel, there were actually a lot of different kind of, we'll call them smaller providers of the DIY solutions. And I think DJI made such a good product. And then when they introduced Lightbridge, Lightbridge 2, all of the iterations that you can make when you have 200 PhDs working on this stuff, right? they really consolidated a lot of the providers in the market, both from a product standpoint and then from a like, who the suppliers are going to work at. And so, why I'm saying that is the DJI tech stack, even if you have an intelligent jammer, it moves around when it sees interference, okay? And that's what should have been warning us five years ago that what you just described, right, let's call it intelligent RF, was going to come. And now that there's a war and you have Ukrainians and Russians and Iranians building tens of thousands of drones a month, and they're disposable, the unit costs to go build, those competitive technologies are going to drop down. So what's gonna happen what we've seen and what we've been told, by both Ukrainians and, friends who've spent a lot of time on the ground there, and from our trips to Ukraine is this that. Basically, everyone's monitoring the spectrum at all times, okay? And a lot of the, wideband jammers you're starting to see are being built out there where you have to find the drone in the noise if you're looking for that control link because you can now move between, channels and frequencies with ease, right? And I think we're in the first inning of that. I think by the end of this year, we're going to see some new products that do it even better than they're doing today. But what the Ukrainians and the Russians have done is they've basically adjusted their tactics around a couple key assumptions, right? One is that there's going to be no GPS for 40 to 50 kilometers along the FLOT the front line, right? Maybe 10 kilometers on each side, 40 kilometers in the middle. You are not operating with GPS. That's your first assumption. Okay? So if you start with that, and then you start with, oh, and by the way, everyone has jammers or RF signal, detectors that are able to triangulate sitting in trees so that when you launch a drone, if you don't launch it super far back or put it in the air really quickly and move, we will be able to lock on to where you are in your region and we're going to go put a lot of artillery shells right there. So those are just the key assumptions that everyone's operating under right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>table stakes basically\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's it. Correct. And so what do you do and how have they adapted? One, you look at alternative frequencies. So maybe things like Starlink or flying over LTE. And remember, there's also not a lot of LTE here because they know this happens. So they go and blow up the towers, right? But the second thing you do is you build signal repeaters and you either put them in trees, right? Or you put them on other drones. And that is how today, a lot of the stuff, if you like go on my LinkedIn, you're watching coordinated attacks from ISR drones to FPV drones. That's happening a lot of times with, the Ukrainian drone that uses, they like to call it the Baba Yaga, Which is like the witch that, steals children. You put it in the air, it's a lot harder to triangulate it because you can one, move it around, or if it's tethered to a car, you can drive the car around and the drone will follow it, right? You also, when you're up at 1, 000 feet or 800 feet or 500 feet or whatever, you also get a better line of sight. So now, these FPV drones that usually, at the start of the war were going 1 to 5 kilometers, they're flying them 30 kilometers. So I think this whole thing starts to change and we are building a fleet of products out of the same manufacturing cell and now we're building the software to coordinate all of them where people are going to have coordinated drone swarms that do that. You're going to have ISR drones that tell smaller kamikaze drones to go attack stuff and today they're in five to ten person kill teams but in the future that'll all be automated and it's coming in the next 12 to 18 months from Firestorm. We're not the only people who are seeing how this works, and they're basically building, one or two person drone teams that can go achieve this type of success. And I think that's going to make fighting RF really difficult. You're going to need bigger, more expensive solutions. You're going to need layered defenses, right? and I would not be surprised. a lot of this is starting to be open sourced, like the Russians and the Ukrainians are using drones that they basically preload an image of what they want to go run into the drone, and then they go send it in the air and they have it go hunt. And I think that's where one, humans get really scared because robots are making decisions. Two, we as the West, there's tons of material out there saying is this the world we want to live in? Right? And so there's some philosophical discussions we need to have as a society. I think whoever starts getting to that technology first is going to have a massive upper hand in the next coming decades. It's, and it's going to happen because there's a war where it's already happening and they're getting better with every rep.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of all of the counter UAS response options that exist today from guns and drone interceptors and direct energy weapons and electronic warfare, nets, falcons, eagles, streamers, aerosols, you name it. Which have the potential for the most rapid adoption and scaling? If you were to, start another counter UAS company today, what would you focus on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I can't start an RF one cause I still have a non compete for a couple of years. But, no, I would just invest super heavily into something that does drone on drone. I would attack a very certain part of the chain. I think the game is going to be go after the motherships, whether that's the Baba Yagas that are the signal repeaters or the ISR birds that are at, a couple thousand feet doing laps for five or six hours or 10 hours trying to find targets. I would try and basically either cut off the repeaters or the eyes. And I think you can do that in a way because a human is still in the loop today, and they will be for, I think, a while, running that part of the operation. If it's a guy with an FPV drone flying this one to five kilometers, one to 10 kilometers, those people are always going to be there. But I think as you see the coordination of those things, you got to try and either attack that or even go left to launch, And that's when stuff gets super gnarly and that's where our intelligence agencies need to be playing. If they're not already.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And left of launch is easy to say, and it makes sense for, larger aircraft that have a more meaningful launch and recovery footprint. But when you're talking about drones that you can launch, from a backpack or just on the go, it's a lot more difficult, to implement in practice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let me run the scenario in my brain and I'm shooting from the hip here. Okay. So guys poke holes in this, but like we did a phenomenal job in the war in Afghanistan and then even in the ISIS fight in Syria of figuring out where these, roadside bomb factories were coming from by tracing where the money was going. And I remember distinctly when we were working with Naval Special Warfare, when they told us yeah, we found the 2 million dollar order of DJI drones that went through Turkey that were obviously then just walked across the battlefield into Syria and were dispersed into the factories. That's the type of stuff if you look at like supply chain for these things, right. You could have a hundred people swiping a credit card, but if you're going to do this on an industrial scale, you got to figure out where are, and again, this is maybe more terrorist than like state actor, but who's buying, 15, 000 batteries,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>right? This is far left of launch.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm talking way far left to the launch. If you want to go closer to left to launch, you're going to need persistent ISR and satellites. That's what you're going to have to try and figure out, right? It's like, where are their launch fields? Are there patterns? But the problem with a lot of these things too, is you can take them out of a car, put them in the air or use a catapult, right? Pack it all up in two minutes and leave. So I'm not smart enough to say, that's how you should go after that. But I would just tell you like the RF triangulation and then some of the interesting things like the Ukrainians, like they've talked about how they have these 50, 000 Samsung phones all listening for the sound of a Shahed across their border. And then once they match that sound, like that's the type of creative thinking you need, which is a lot of low cost sensors doing fusion, and crunching data, in my opinion, if we're going to start figuring out, how do you actually maybe stop some of these things from happening? We're just not there yet today. And don't, I haven't personally given it too much thought yet. Cause it's so daunting of a challenge\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dan, I just keep coming back to the question of mass, and how if you look at the countermeasures in the RF spectrum, you look at the idea of countering things left of launch, but if your opponent is throwing a lot of mass into the air, a lot of air vehicles, they're transmitting on a lot of different channels, how does that change the assumptions in this approach? Because when we're talking about drones that are at this type of price point and that can be mass produced this way, I think mass takes on a new role all its own that we haven't seen in recent decades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Completely. And it's because we didn't have to fight people who had these type of counter measures for the last 20 years. Right? So the global war on terror basically leveraged a lot of kind of legacy Cold War systems and repurposed them for a fight against an insurgency that was not a high tech insurgency. And I don't mean that like the Taliban and ISIS and Al Qaeda, they figured out ways to do a lot of really nasty stuff. But it's not like you have, 80 years of state sponsored universities like you have in Russia or, Tehran or China. Where you pump out really good engineers who are now being co opted to solve some of these problems. For me, Peter, I try and keep this really simple. I love sports and I always think that speed kills. What I mean by that is if I put so many things in front of you or move so fast that it causes you to have to make a really quick decision, the human brain and even computers can only make so many right decisions before they make a wrong decision. So if you can create that chaos and use that to your advantage or the threat of that chaos, I think that's a really good deterrent and that's what led us to found Firestorm with the idea of democratizing the sky, Build so many things at such a low cost that are modular so that you can use this platform for a variety of missions that you could literally, paint the sky black. You know what I mean? And the only way we're going to get there is with kind of three key things. One is new approaches to manufacturing. The day of the exquisitely made drone, in my opinion, are numbered. General Atomics and the Reaper is going to have a very, they own that part of the market. They're gonna keep selling birds. We're seeing the Houthis shoot them down now with 50 to 100 thousand dollar missiles. So they're gonna need to stay back and they're going to need to do just like the Ukrainians and Russians are showing us. They need to be the signal relay or the pipe back to the command center. And you're going to need to have a ton, and I mean, like hundreds of smaller, cheaper platforms extending out in front of them, right? That's where the world is going to go. And that's where it needs to go. And because the conflict in Ukraine is showing us that it's changing every couple of weeks. I think, LePlant, yesterday or two days ago, he said, we're seeing EW change every three weeks in Ukraine. And we are not built for that. You need to build systems just like the Ukrainians are building the small drones. We need to do this for the big drones. They need to be modifiable. And for us, that means at Firestorm, it means from propulsion, so a pusher prop that can stay in the air for hours, right? Or it means a jet engine where we can go scream at a hundred to 200 miles an hour and go somewhere really fast and be really torquey to an EDF where we can go like pretty silent, right? That's one part of the modularity, but also from a payload standpoint. I think it's whoever builds a lot of trucks with a really simple integration plan to it and the operating system to make everything work together is going to win because we're already seeing them do that in these disparate little manufacturing cells in Ukraine. We're not seeing that on fixed wing and that's why we've, raised a bunch of money and started to win contracts for that, but it's all about overwhelming. If you overwhelm you control. That is just, I think what's going to happen. I mean, look at the picture behind me, right? How do you shoot all those airplanes down? It's the same exact idea.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the thing we keep reminding ourselves of is that the new status quo that we're talking about here is only 12 months old, and it's not going to remain a constant, just wait two years and see what this, landscape looks like. If people identify that repeaters are a single point of failure, and those are the things to target, then guess what? They're going to be 10x repeaters in the air few months from now. It's constantly adapting. And so, we need to build not for what we see in the battlefield right now, but we need to anticipate another leap in scale coming in, months, not decades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exactly. And what you just said requires us as a country to not be arrogant or the West in general, right? We fought insurgents who had no resources. We're watching the world bifurcate into two camps, and they both have a lot of resources and a lot of intelligence. So, for us, it is payload bay, electronic hookups, a operating system and a universal flight controller for a fixed wing drone, and no arrogance on our side. We just need to make a lot of those and allow you to modify it. We have our preloads, but we need to basically not have that arrogance.

And if that's, so one, and then number two, if there is going to be a technology change, that obviates the need for overwhelming volume, what would it be?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So some of the more interesting things we've seen out of Ukraine, let me frame it in that debate, cause I think that'll help explain why I think that could, you know, could go either way. Ukrainians are supply chain constrained. They can't put a$2000 NVIDIA chip on every drone they make. So what they've gone and done is they've found a bunch of Texas instrument chips that are$50 that give them a high level of compute that are built in Europe that they can build terminal guidance on. All right. And so you're not needing to do this on an NVIDIA. You can do this on a$50 chip, maybe have a couple of them, okay, so you have some more compute. That's the first step in one of those exquisite technologies, basically being dumbed down and put onto something that is truly disposable. And I think that what we really got to see here is, I think it's going to be a mix of both, if I'm going to be honest. Because even the Ukrainians are telling us why they like our technology is we can make a ton of stuff quickly. So you're going to have to marry the sledgehammer with the sniper rifle, or the shotgun with the sniper and whoever does that in the right way, and that's why we're saying like, Hey, we think that we have some baseline technology that works, but if there's other stuff that's out there, like we will integrate it in days, right? Because we want to be able to provide that overwhelming force with the intelligent capability. Look, you could very well have something that comes out of left field here that totally overwhelms everything we've ever seen and it's like, true neural networked swarms of intelligent drones doing things. For quadcopters, there's some really promising stuff, for fixed wing stuff it's still in development. Right. And we're partnering with a bunch of people to start making these swarms make decisions at a hundred miles an hour, as opposed to 30 or 40, but I don't think we have enough information yet, Jim, to be like, this is what's going to win one way or the other. Is it the sledgehammer or the tech? We're betting that the manufacturing is always going to be a player and so we'd prefer to basically partner with the tech. And so if, and when the killer app is built, we have a way to go field 50, 000 of them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can you paint a picture for how the human operator's role is going to change as the scale of these swarms increases? For instance, in Ukraine today what does a mission look like for a human operator? Does that person manage the drone from launch all the way through to the completion of its mission? That one air vehicle, or is there a lot of handoff going on, and as we head towards bigger and bigger swarms and more complex attacks, how does a team of operators manage a much larger number of drones? What is that going to look like in the future?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's a couple of different pieces to this question. Today, a lot of the teams, you have one person reporting to the people flying the ISR bird with like, hey, this is what I see, and we think it's over in this area. And then you have somebody with a map standing right next to the pilot of the FPV, saying like, oh look, yeah, that tree looks like it should be right there, keep moving to the right, right? Remember,'cause there's no GPS here. I think that with more exquisite kind of systems in the air, like with laser target designators or a way to hand off, terrain mapping features of what this thing saw to another drone. If you could synthesize that, then the drone could figure out where it should be going, will be coming in the next, in a while. Today, the teams really consist of people behind the front lines, controlling and flying the drones, the repeater drones in the air, the ISR drones doing the circling, and then teams that have to sneak up towards the front line to launch the FPV drones, then get out of there before they get shelled, right? So we're talking like eight to 10 person teams. There are expensive versions of that now by Western primes. Too expensive for where the world is going. I think as people develop ultra low cost, I'm talking like, let's call it, a couple million dollars for dozens and dozens of big and small drones that can work together. That's where you need to be going if you want to be competitive with what the Russians and the Chinese and the Iranians will be doing in the future. So the team of the future, we want it to be one or two people, and we want to have kind of systems that can automatically launch and recover, placed in a variety of areas. And a lot of that kind of, without giving too much away, a lot of that feedback comes directly from talking to tons of Ukrainian drone operators and tons of kill teams as they explained to us the tactics that work and how they've had to build them. Fighting with those two baselines we talked about earlier, which is no GPS, and assuming that you only have like 90 seconds, maybe, before they triangulate where you are, and they just whack you with an artillery shell. So it's how do you get the stuff from behind the jamming area, or behind the targeting area, into the area you need to find the targets, either people or vehicles, and then how do you launch the supporting vehicles in a way that doesn't harm, people who have to sneak up to launch it. And we're, we've already won a contract with the Air Force to do a bunch of that, where we're carrying other drones into combat. So now we have ISR and then smaller drones. And so that's one way in which you're starting to see that happen in Ukraine as well. And I'm glad the U S government's really leaning forward with that project here domestically too, because we think that's really important. And, you know, that's one way in which we get to that overwhelming intelligence plus sledgehammer, right? You put a lot of stuff at the edge and maybe some of the smaller things have some really good capability and you have so many of them that who cares if you lose a couple thousand, we've at least identified all the targets we need to go run into and or follow, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How mature are swarming, true swarming operations in Ukraine?

I think they have a system that works and I don't think they feel comfortable with a lot of the technologies that have been developed yet to deploy that out there. I'm just giving you guys like no bullshit when they say to us, do not give us your exquisite stuff, because if it doesn't work on the first or second try, we will literally put it in a garage and start tearing the pieces out of it we want, and we will not fly it. We will cannibalize it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's what we hear. We hear from drone operators that, people throw all kinds of, feature rich, complex, very, shiny products at them. And the feedback that we're getting is, look, I don't think that those people understand the kind of user that is going to put this in their hands. This is a sleep deprived, afraid, stressed, a hundred other things on their mind type of user who just needs very simple buttons.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>8 to 12 hour shifts, right? Every single day, for months, that's who you're dealing with. it, I, Luka, you nailed it. So, like, a couple things need to happen here at the same time across the Western version of our drone industry because I'm going to just collectively put, heh, the bifurcating world is happening, right? We need to make these things super easy to use. And so for us on our team, it's taking the lessons of Citadel for how easy it was to run a counter UAS system, right? Making it look magical on a UI/UX screen, and doing all of the complicated stuff in the background. And we're about to debut our new mission planner where it ingests real world data into a 3d environment with real physics engines and allows you to modify. What do you want to do? Do you want to do an ISR capability? Great. Set up your mission, right? You want to do a loitering strike. Great. Set up your mission. But again, this is V1 of this thing. It's probably already way too complicated than it needs to be. But for us, we see a world where you need to use existing technologies that people have been trained on and make the magic happen in the background so that they can run it on a cell phone or a tablet, something that they're already really familiar with. Right. But, Coming back to your original point, we're hearing the same thing. And I think the problem we've run into, and we have to be very delicate here, the Ukrainians need materials. They are in a life or death struggle. Where they have a problem is that they go, not all the stuff you send us works because it's over complicated and it's not built for a jamming environment, full stop. But it's hard to tell somebody who's giving you a lot of money that you don't like what they have. Now they've gotten better in the last year of saying, this is the type of stuff we want. And if you guys look at the Wall Street Journal, I'm not going to name anybody, we've been hearing this for a year of companies that have sent tens, hundreds, maybe a billion dollars of product over there that when we go over there, we see them in warehouses, full stop, right? And that's material. And all they're asking for and what they like about Firestorm, and I don't mean to just keep plugging it, but we are listening to the customer, they're like, we need a system that has propulsion, that's modular and that we can easily get into and modify. That's what they need. Cause that's what they're having to use constantly on the battlefield. Right. You modify stuff.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's the greatest limiting factor of this let's say high technology that's being sent to them? What are the biggest reasons it's not working for them? So one, you said it's a jamming environment. It doesn't seem like these people are anticipating the jamming environment. Number two, you mentioned these people are sleep deprived. They don't have the mental awareness that's needed to be able to operate these. What else is the fault of the billion dollars of technology that's being sent over, that's not working for them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How it's built. It's not built to be modified. Like literally changing a nose cone is not modular. Need to be able to get in there. You need to be able to put bigger payloads in. You need to put smaller payloads in. That stuff's really important. Change comm systems. These are hard problems. We understand this is a marathon, right? And we understand that we can't do everything. We're very, egoless over here about where we are as a business. We're a young drone manufacturer, but we listened to the end customer that says like, look, have your build outs, but have it be able to be modified. And there has been some disconnect between what the U. S. is funding and what the Ukrainians are asking for. And it's a very delicate situation because you don't want to like, do you know what I mean? Like it's hard when someone gives you a lot of money to tell them like, Hey, we don't want that. Right? But you are having people in the U. S. government, like LaPlante, come out and openly say, we gave them all these GPS guided artillery shells, none of them work. You know what I mean? And then there's a couple Wall Street Journals UAVs that are not working.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dan, what are you hearing from end users in the battlefield, as it relates to existing, call it workflow, call it kill chain, but what parts of that workflow are still manual, difficult, time consuming? On the one hand, what we hear is that for instance, the target detection or the ISR bird that's looking out for targets of opportunity that on the one hand, it feels like that is something that could be somewhat easily automated, but when you actually talk to the people who are on the battlefield, you realize that this is still a very manual, far from being automated, part of that workflow. What other things are you hearing that people are having most problems with?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, look, What I think you're going to see in the next two years, and I'm just going to say like where I think it's going and it will show where I think a lot of these pieces will be automated. You're seeing like ground robots in cars, right? A lot of money. A lot of talent has gone and worked in that space over the last, what, decade, probably, as we've started to use computer vision to solve real problems. And guys, I have a four year old Tesla. There's two parts of my drive where it still can't determine something and it freaks out a little bit. So we're not there on that stuff, but there's hundreds of millions or billions of hours now of video where these models can go and learn, right? We don't have that yet for UAVs. The Ukrainians are building that. They have tons and tons of footage, but I think that's going to help with automatic target recognition and then terminal guidance, honestly. And you're starting to see some of that stuff pop up on GitHub. Which means I think a lot of that stuff will be commoditized over the next couple of years as you build the right kind of data training pipelines on that stuff. And I think that there's opportunities for Western governments to work together to collaboratively build some of these models and then to figure out how to run them at the edge with very low power. Do you know what I mean? so that's one area. So let's call that the kind of target, recognition. I think the second area, which has been just fascinating to me is you talk to some of the guys who run deep strike okay. So we're talking like hundreds and hundreds of miles or, a thousand kilometers. Right. And, They will literally have someone flying with a map next to them, right? A map on a phone and they are doing visual identification,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>dead reckoning,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>reckoning. it's. That, that, that'll change. There's a bunch of companies working on that.

It's, I'll be honest, like when you ask the guys, what are you guys using for non GPS denied navigation? And they're like, well, not a lot. And you ask them why? And they're like, well, cause it's, again, maybe we're in the third inning of the ball game, not in the first inning, but it's coming along, but then there's some also really interesting non visual, INS stuff that's out there. We've seen, we're integrating one of them right now that we're pretty excited about, that we are being told by end users is very successful out there, and it does not use GPS, which is interesting. But I think you're going to see multiple little bites to be taken out of like where you need a human to solve a problem, right? And I think it's going to be a lot of little steps every week, will result in like a year from now, we'll be like, May 1st of 25, we're going to be like, Oh my goodness, can you believe we had 10 person drone kill teams? And we had, a guy looking at a map on his phone or tablet trying to figure out where he was. And we had, a drone not being able to coordinate with another drone, what to go run into. Do you know what I mean? Something like that. I think some of that stuff's coming. They don't actively talk about the need for a swarm, which is very interesting because the swarm dominates our conversation here. We talk about drone swarms all the time, both from a national security perspective and what we need to build. They're just like, well, there's a lot of targets and there's a lot of data we have to crunch. Let's just be smart and get stuff out there and then solve the problem. Because the humans still make better decisions because they've been trained at this point, right? So, I, and I don't think that goes away anytime soon, but in the next couple of years, maybe you have something where you're simplifying the decision making process for, is this a friend or a foe or a threat?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned two assumptions that people are taking as table stakes: no GPS, and then, jammers and direction finders everywhere. What other assumptions both the users and people who are providing technologies to those users should anticipate in the future of drone warfare, and especially from the perspective of a founder, right, or an investor where you want to, build products that have relevance in the years to follow and in an environment that changes so rapidly, what additional assumptions do you think that are safe to make? Arguably you're talking mass and modularity and production. what else?

Yeah. More, more along the lines of that type of vertical integration, right? We have six or seven propulsion systems we use, and that's because I just have concerns about supply chain for everything. I do think some things like sensors and cameras and radios, I think over the next couple of years, I have less concern about that kind of being decoupled. I think there's enough demand now, from China. Right. But what I would say is this is where the problem is because the U.S. DoD is not built to buy modular stuff. It just is not, it's used to buying a SKU. And so if you're going to look at the war in Ukraine, we need to really think about how do we align the incentives for the procurer and then the entrepreneur to solve that problem. And it's really tough. And so for us it means buying a lot of time and raising a lot of money and selling the stuff to a variety of folks to buy that time, because I do believe it will catch up because there's no other way we're going to fight the conflicts of the future. Right, because of the jamming and the GPS, that's just like the start of the table stakes, but the issues I think founders are going to face is if you're building really cool software or one piece of the puzzle, if you do not have a platform to put it on, it is very hard to find customers. And I think that, again, everything, including drones, is going to be commoditized over the next four to five years. So you have to have a business model where you can build lots of stuff, put it on things to basically get it into the fight, and, and still be able to make money. Right.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. and that's critical and sorry to interrupt, but, you're raising a really important point because traditionally, people associate big moats, with some single piece of really interesting proprietary technology. But if you're moving towards a world where a lot of the products that work are actually very simple, very affordable things that you need to be able to produce at volume. If you're trending towards this model, which, broadly is commoditized hardware, then innovating on the business model, on some of the other dimensions really becomes the key source of, defensibility for founders, which is a different way of thinking about ensuring this defensibility of the business.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Totally. And I think that means then as founders, you have to look at markets outside of the U.S. as well. We're addicted to buying big, expensive things. The Marine Corps just bought 450 million of product that you can go read the Wall Street Journal to see how it's performing in Ukraine. That was a week ago. I mean, we're, again, we're addicted to doing this. In the world I see it, and why we brought Lockheed Martin on as an investor early, the big guys know how the game works. And defense is exclusionary by nature. The world, if we're going to be successful, is small companies working with big companies to effect change within the Department of Defense. And the same thing needs to happen with our allies around the world, These big defense companies exist because they've been a very secure way to build big cold war types of systems. And so the systems have been built to protect them and keep them in business so that if conflict breaks out, you have the ability to scale exquisite systems. The world is just changing, right? Again, you can go watch my LinkedIn. I do this a couple times a week where I show a thousand dollar system blowing up a multi million dollar system. We're talking millions of dollars of ROI on small drones knocking out armored vehicles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You've made comments on Replicator recently.

I think the key thing is going to be, and I think what all of industry and Congress is asking for is to take risks so that we keep doing things the way we have done them. And what I mean by that is how do we build more of stuff faster? That's the key. The delivery delays are just too long for a lot of the big more exquisite systems. And you're looking at Ukraine with 10, 000 people making 10, 000 plus drones a month. And I'm not saying that everything needs to be FPV, but that should be helping you dictate where you go with this side with this and the problem we're going to run into, it's like, so say DIU funds, the start, who's going to fund it after that? Right? That's the big problem we're going to see, I think, on some of this stuff. I'm not worried about where does the first tranche of cash come from? I'm worried about where does it go longer term? Because again, to become a program of record you need money. You need palm cycle there's all of these things that kind of prevent that from happening. And, I want to make sure we're taking risks now, cause in the scheme of things, a billion dollars that they have to spend is nothing for the DoD, right?

But is there something that you are particularly excited about, that you're seeing on the horizon or something that you would point our entrepreneurial audience to go and innovate in and solve.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the more we can bring in human and machine teaming to the decision making in the build up, to running a mission, the better. You know what I mean? I'll just leave it broad like that, but a lot of data goes into like, where do we spend our resources and where do we put things in the air? There's a lot of interesting technologies now you can fuse from satellite images, to weather data, to terrain, to news that's happening, like all of that stuff is out there. And if you can synthesize it to help you make better decisions for where you should fly your systems, I think that's going to be, play a huge role over the next 10 years, right? Like go run 50,000, 100,000 it's like the General Mattis, right? I want my soldiers to run, 50 bloodless battles before they go into combat. Well, 50 sounds light. Let's go run 50, 000 scenarios before we go in and do something. I think that's where this is going to get really interesting because that data can then feed what type of platform you put in the air and what type of payload you put on the platform. Some of the more interesting startups I've seen that have thought about this in a variety of ways have gone after kind of the data problems that those things will require. That's a really unique way to tackle something that both the primes, small businesses, and the government would probably all pay a license for\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dan, what about use cases on the commercial side of things? You've been in this industry for a while. what are your thoughts on the major demand and supply forces at play here?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm bullish on components and basically the decoupling of the supply chain. It's a little bit of chicken and egg. Everyone's like, well, do you ban DJIs? Does that then kill the whole drone industry? Does that jumpstart the domestic stuff? We're seeing NDAA compliant pieces and products go to Mexico. There's a robust supply chain being built in Vietnam. Okay. Cause don't forget guys, before the Vietnam war, the Chinese are their enemy, their generational enemy. Right. And they did fight a war after the Vietnam war with them. And they have really good manufacturing technologies there. I think that, as more of the beyond visual line of sight stuff kind of gets ironed out here, you're starting to see people over the last couple of years, starting to get waivers. I think the future is autonomous. I think you're going to see more and more human and machine teaming. And a good thesis has always been like, what can you do, or what can you put on a drone so that you don't have to fly a And we see a lot of helicopters flying over power lines where I live in Southern California, looking at stuff. I think that's a good use case for drones. You're seeing a bunch of these drone first responders software companies come out where they're like, hey, we'll build a whole management solution. But again, I think for a lot of the different stuff, it's going to be, you have to commoditize the prices of it. And that's where this thing gets really tricky because to force a change you got to have something either one, be very expensive to force someone to change their behavior. Or two, you have to offer an overwhelming product. And I think that some of the stuff's really good. Like you're seeing a lot of drones being used in ag because, there's less people working in ag. So that's a natural kind of replacement, if you will, of humans. I still think we're probably five or 10 years away from like mass adoption for these systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I want to ask you about the supply chain. We have talked in the past about that and you mentioned that you're less concerned today than you were, say, a year or two years ago in terms of the ability to source some of these critical components. Any additional light that you can shine on the state of the supply chain and how disadvantaged is the Western supply chain still to the consumer electronics supply chain coming out of China?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. It's very disadvantaged. If you guys have ever been to Southern China. If you want to build a product, they have their almost internal Amazon, you can say, hey, I need 10 of these motors and they'll show up that afternoon. It's incredible. And you can start testing them. And a lot of that is just Southern China was the factory of the world for the last 20 years. So it's going to take some time, but look, NDAA compliance, a desire to move away from just the reliance on China for everything is happening not just here, but around the world and I will just say, like, at Exponential last week, I was really impressed by how many products are saying we're either moving out or we're already out of China. It's fascinating. So, I think it's just a trend that continues and maybe that makes some of the subsystems more expensive in the short term, but in the long term, I think, look, as things move out of China, everything's going to get more expensive. That's, let's just be honest, but I think you're seeing a lot of the kind of manufacturing supply chain be rewritten. Living in San Diego, you guys would not believe how much construction is happening right at the border or right over the border. It's millions of square feet of manufacturing is going on there as companies near shore. So, I think that's a trend that just continues.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any parting thoughts for the audience or advice for entrepreneurs or, otherwise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's an interesting time in the world.

The first question we ask ourselves when we're trying to go do something new, whether that's a new location, new airspace, new environment, new weather envelope, new aircraft, all these different things. The first thing we ask ourselves is, what is the level of safety that we need to achieve for these operations and how do we have the confidence that we have achieved that? And early on in the program, we'll say, what do we need to do in order to look back and what does success look like in the testing or analysis that we're going to conduct? Then the next question is, what's the regulatory pathway, what do we need to show compliance with? What are the regulator expectations? And so I think that's something that isn't fully unique to Zipline, but I think is a little bit unique where a number of aviation companies start off with a compliance mindset and Zipline was founded on more first principles than that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Eric Watson from Zipline. Hey, listen, you can't help, but be impressed with the inspiring and important work that Zipline has done with their partners in Africa. With medical and healthcare outcomes that are remarkable. So you'll really enjoy hearing about Zipline and their first platform in Africa. Eric gives an excellent overview. We then transitioned to their work in the United States with our platform two. We discuss how their experiences in Africa helped and contributed to their U.S. performance. We discuss what's similar and what's completely different between the two markets. Listen, Eric is a pro at discussing the U.S. certification process. He takes it from ground up. As if we were starting from scratch, what's required, what has changed throughout the years what's working well and what can be improved and and how the certification process is different than what they first anticipated upon launching the United States. He also discusses where there's been tremendous progress in the last year. I really liked Eric's response to Peter's question of where Zipline sees the operational boundary line between missions they would fly with platform one with their airdrop method versus missions Zipline would fly with the hovering capability of platform two and that type of delivery method. Great response. Listen in advanced air mobility there's always this struggle with product market fit. Many of the players in the market had been accused of having a technical capability and are in search for a market or a problem to solve. It is entirely refreshing to hear that Zipline started with a massive problem to solve in Africa. And from that impressive work have demonstrated success in medical outcomes in Africa are really just amazing What it really comes down to is how that success translates into a bigger, yet more complex and more competitive market in the United States where their unique platform two can deliver with precision on a dinner plate with almost no noise whatsoever. Listen from Eric and how they believe they can compete in this much different market. I really enjoyed preparing for this podcast, their CEO Keller Rinaudo Cliffton is very impressive. And Eric also has a passion and eloquence in telling what they've done and where they're going as a company. But I also like about Eric and perhaps it's just a part of the culture of Zipline is that he positively talked about what is possible versus the hurdles that he faces for example, in certification, where oftentimes we only hear about the hurdles and the difficulties of working with regulatory bodies. Perhaps, it's just another reason why Zipline is having such success. Eric thanks for joining us and to our listeners we hope you'll enjoy our talk with Eric Watson as you innovate The Vertical Space. Eric Watson has been at Zipline since 2016, where he is currently the Head of Systems Engineering, Certification, and System Safety. Two of Eric's proudest moments at Zipline have been helping set up the first national scale drone delivery system in Rwanda and achieving the first beyond visual line of sight operations with an onboard detect and avoid system in the United States. Eric is passionate about moving the UAS and autonomous aviation industry towards safe and efficient airspace integration and including a participation in leadership roles in UAS Standards, Development efforts. Eric has a background in aerospace engineering. And before joining Zipline, he worked designing and launching small satellites and co-founded a start up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, welcome to The Vertical Space.

There's autonomous drones delivering products and dependent upon in different communities just really depends where you are in the world. so I think that's something that some people maybe don't realize or underappreciate and think that it might be some far off distant future, whereas there's other parts of the world that are, depending upon drone delivery services for healthcare, logistics, and other things that really make an impact in the community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you think is the source of this skepticism? We've heard this, as well. There's always those folks who for a variety of reasons are quite convinced that this is not going to work. Obviously we do believe that this is a huge market opportunity, but in your words, what do you see as some of the most credible criticisms and how would you respond?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, I'm not sure if it's, I'm sure there are some credible criticisms. I think most of the misconception just stems from a lack of it being tangible, right? Zipline's delivering, over 84 percent of the, health facilities in Rwanda and as an example, and we've started operations commercially in 2016. So. a number of years of experience doing this and I think for a lot of people in the world, that just feels distant, right? And there are areas in the United States that Zipline and others are, delivering to communities and providing access to different products and in a more efficient, safer, more green way. And I think that a lot of people hasn't been their backyard yet. Right. It hasn't come to them yet. And so it just feels like something that's less tangible and, and feels far off and distant. But in my opinion, being pretty close to the technology side and also having spent, years, working on unscaling this up and partnership with healthcare partners, regulators, different folks, it's really pretty obvious when you see it is my personal opinion, right? When you, if you might see either access that wasn't existent before, right? Didn't exist before and now exists. Or if you see someone order something or need something that's quite small, you need some children's Tylenol delivered quickly and a car shows up on your, in your street, throws the emergency flashers on and a person walks out and hands you a bottle of children's Tylenol that doesn't make a ton of sense compared to just being able to get something quickly and efficiently delivered with the right sized, autonomous, delivery system for the product that needs to be delivered in an efficient way. So I think once you see it and that the system's in action, I think it becomes pretty obvious, but there's just a lot of people in the world who haven't had the opportunity yet to be able to have that experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some have when you look at the operations that WING is conducting and also Manna, in Ireland and starting in the U. S. People who are experiencing drone delivery are, really excited and open and passionate about it. But there seems to be obviously those who drone delivery hasn't touched yet that remain skeptical about things like noise and, how really convenient this will be. Will this be available every time that I need it? So I'm sure we'll get into a lot of different aspects of this in the conversation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good point, Luka. Eric, I can't wait for you to tell the story of Zipline you know, how you started. The work you've done, providing access to important goods to those who have not had access, you know, it's a big part of who Zipline is. You've published, listen, meaningful outcomes in really well-respected journals with what you've accomplished in Africa. Is that what makes you different? Is that why you believe drone services are here to stay?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a great point and it's a great point, Jim. I think that this is a big, this is a big part of it. And it's very intentional, I think that anytime that you're bringing a new product, a new service to the world that didn't previously exist, I think it's important to be very cognizant of what the approach is, And Zipline focusing on some of the biggest problems initially, it was a very intentional thing for us to do. And so it makes for, it, in our experience, it has made for a community that has welcomed us in pretty much every instance with open arms. And so just to make that a little bit more tangible, I was in Rwanda and in 2016, helping to make those initial operations. And, yeah, and going out and talking with doctors, talking with lab techs and, people who ran the pharmacies at some of these health facilities. And when we started operations, I remember very vividly, first of all, just showing up at some of these remote facilities in more rural parts of Rwanda and being received like a, like some sort of rockstar, which is fun. and just being so thankful and so appreciative of the service that we were able to offer to help them complete their mission, like their life mission. and all the cases in my experience has been to provide those local communities with better medical care, And so just us doing our small part to be able to allow them to better execute on that mission has been a great partnership. And, the first piece of feedback that was just every single place that we went to early days was, when are you going to expand from 12 hours a day to 24 hours a day? When we first started, we started 12 hours a day service at, seven days a week through 365, but it was only 12 hours a day. And so that I remember, we were like any startup you're looking for product market fit. and we. we're optimistic, but you never know until you get there and so when you provide a new service to the world, to a portion of the world, and the first bit of feedback that you get is we want more of your service, is a pretty good piece of feedback, So, yeah, I think that's really positive. It's very intentional to, to start in those areas and to focus on those kind of beachhead markets that are maybe most in need or most, flexible and willing to be willing partners to go through any of the road bumps that happened in the first couple of years of a brand new service that you're bringing into the world. But I do think that's a big part of it. And I also think that, that point of enabling access to healthcare products, and then, also we're expanding beyond healthcare products in certain places That's not just the past, I think that we're super excited to expand to, we're now operating in seven countries and three different continents today and expanding on that. So that's, healthcare first and every one of those markets we're expanding into the UK with a partnership with the national healthcare system, this year. We have many of our partners in the U S that we are currently serving and also going to be launching with our healthcare partners. So this is not something that's unique to, you know, only certain parts of the world and it's not something that is Zipline's origin story, we're going away from, right. This is a core part of who we are and we're really excited to continue that mission.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, what was that discussion like around the table back in 2016 to bet the company on going so far away from home and picking Rwanda? What were the risks or the objections around the table that came up and how did you guys work through to that decision?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's a great question. So I think there's a misconception out there that we picked Rwanda. It's more that Rwanda picked us, obviously it's a partnership. It's bidirectional, but, there are a few things that were clear to us back then, and that was that we need to get the service into the real world to get customer feedback and learn quickly. We weren't going to be successful by, staying inside the building, and perfecting a system that had never really experienced customer feedback. That's not how great products are developed. So we need to get outside the building, start serving customers, and that's where we're going to learn. So that was very clear to us. It also was very clear to us that we need to solve the biggest problem first, right? And so that focused in, in healthcare in some of these areas where they didn't have, there were parts of the world that didn't have the best access to healthcare. So that, that had us looking in those areas. But then really, what we did is we ran a bit of a horse race, We were looking with different partners that met those criteria. and then Rwanda took the bet on Zipline. We were a small startup. Especially back then, and for the national healthcare system of, an awesome country like Rwanda, to bet on Zipline was, I think, a really insightful, profound and, risky thing for them to do at the time. and so that was just, it, I think Zipline's culture, we have a bit of a chip on our shoulder, if you will, to prove that this technology, has a really positive impact that it can make in the world and is a big part of the future. And that was just a really big bet placed on us on that partnership from the country of Rwanda and leadership within the country that we felt a personal responsibility to deliver on. which is a big part of us making the decision and going forward. and honestly, it also, the way you asked, the question in some ways, it makes it sound like we had a lot of choices, When you're a small startup, you have to, we didn't have the luxury of having a big, a big treasure chest full of gold, on our side. going in and proving product market fit, proving that there was community acceptance, proving that there is, a real market here was something that we needed to do in order to just to exist for another few years to give it a chance to get to the next level, So we had to be scrappy and pragmatic to go grow, Zipline and improve those things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. I know what you mean. You built a system for that mission, an airplane, with long range with the, airdrop method of delivery, which clearly worked for that mission. As you went through that design process for, what you call platform one where did you assume that that same platform could be expanded to in terms of other missions and markets?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Speaking honestly, that delivery experience, that customer experience has gone farther than we thought it would. We thought that, Hey, flying by and dropping a package in a parachute, into the kind of grass field next to the lab, for example, is this something that's going to, is this a great customer experience? We had some doubts, but it's scaled more than we expected, we're delivering, every day in, in Arkansas, for example, and in partnership with Walmart. since 2021 delivering, both, products from the pharmacy of Walmart, as well as other things from that facility, food, et cetera, to communities in outside of Bentonville, Arkansas, and our customers love it. It's like that same delivery experience has scaled into kind of suburban backyards in the United States. and again, in select communities are really quite well. So that customer experience in that platform has gone beyond what we expected when we were initially designing the system for that, for that specific use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you have a lot of experience flying with that and operations using that platform. Where do you guys now see being the operational boundary line between missions you would fly with platform one and with this airdrop method versus missions you would fly with the hovering capability and that type of delivery method?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So maybe a little bit of background here, just to catch him up who might not, might not know. So Zipline is developing, a platform two system as we call it, and and that system is focused on home delivery, as a vertical takeoff and landing electric aircraft, hovers to take off transitions to fly on the wing and then transitions back to a hover delivery site. Lowers what we call a droid. It's like a cute little robot hanging on a tether down from the aircraft that goes into the delivery area, identifies the right delivery site and leaves the package right where it's needed, whether that's your backyard table or somewhere else. so anyway, that's the, that's that next generation. Quick verbal description, pictures worth a thousand words. So feel free to look it up, but quick verbal description of the platform two system. and yeah, but great question. So we, the platform one system is really designed for long range missions, And so that is instrumental in, positively impacting, the healthcare system and, with our partners, which could be with national healthcare systems, or it could be, local, in the United States or other places, more like local networks, healthcare networks, and it's focused on more rural areas, the edge of suburban, some suburban areas, and then platform two is focused on urban and suburban, home delivery as, as well as moving products, Like lab samples between hospitals and more urban settings. and so that's the distinction is do we need long range and, and also have the ability for, dropping the package into a bit of a bigger area, or is this a shorter range, more dense area that really needs the high delivery accuracy and honestly magical delivery experience of the Platform 2 system?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Over the last year or year and a half, a lot of people in the industry, have been surprised by how much demand is and will be coming from home delivery, suburban delivery of high volume, low value goods like food, like coffee. When you look back to 2016, how did you prioritize these markets? what were your expectations in terms of, the growth opportunity for the healthcare B2B delivery versus Consumer B2C delivery.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We've been very focused on, on the healthcare space as supply and, upbringing that's core to who we are. with that said, and we think there's a real viable business model there that, that can scale. with that said, I remember, Amazon stated about 85 percent of products that they deliver are less than five pounds, So there's a clear need beyond healthcare for instant logistics and instant delivery of all the types of products and some of the ones that you just mentioned, retail, food, et cetera. And so we firmly believe that there's an opportunity for drone delivery and, Zipline being one of those providers to really make a positive change, not just inside healthcare, but be able to, make a positive impact for these other spaces as well, to deliver goods to homes, and other places, but, to homes that are in a more, in a safer, quieter, more efficient way than the current, mechanisms that are used for those deliveries.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric was your Africa experience, a net positive financial experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, there's no way that Zipline exists today without our experience in Africa. so\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But was Africa profitable. Listen, what you did in Africa with providing access to goods. You know, to people who would not otherwise have had it. In an a timely basis. Listen to clearly saved a lot of lives as, and there's a reason why you have such market penetration in Rwanda, in different parts of Africa.

Yeah, there's a, you know, listen, there's a part of me that says, why not just do that everywhere, delivering service to more remote areas. You know, you don't have the same air traffic issues you don't have the same certification issues. Your outcomes are through the roof. And, an argument can be made, just keep doing what you do really, really well, where there's a clear use case. But if you're not making money doing it, then that would explain why you would want to get into a more crowded space.ableit potentially a large market. But a very, very different market with a very different vehicle. But was that profitable?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So we're super excited that we're able to sustainably serve the communities that we're serving in Africa and everywhere that we operate. Zipline has, I think it just comes to the aspirations of the company, we're focused on enabling an instant logistic system that serves everyone equally in healthcare and beyond. And so while we are excited about the, both the mission and the business aspects of serving, communities that may have access challenges, there's more, There's, there's more that we believe that supply can do to positively impact the world than that. And so we're focused, not only on continuing to expand and scale those operations to, expand that positive impact, but also looking at, we feel like we're uniquely positioned to be able to make a positive impact in other areas and in other markets. And so that I think is the main reason for the expansion beyond those initial use cases is that, we're super excited to, to be able to do more. And it isn't a shift away from those core use cases. but it's more of an addition adding on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, can you give us a sense of the kind of utilization that you were able to achieve in Africa and, ballpark cost figures per delivery?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, super excited and a huge shout out to our operations teams in a lot of these markets that really blow me and a lot of the rest of the team away every day. we designed our, platform one system we thought initially that doing, if we could only do 150 deliveries in a day, that would be amazing. That'd be a huge impact. That'll be great for the business, great for the community, and we regularly do over 400 deliveries a day from a number of these facilities without really making many design changes, without doing much, just the operations team has found opportunities for improving efficiency, integrating, smoothing demand, integrating in a really creative ways with local healthcare systems. yeah, it's been really powerful to see the demand from the local communities just continue to increase, and that not just being within, the products we started with. We started in Rwanda, for example, we started with blood products. We expanded To medical products, medicines, vaccines, and, those are basically three of the core product categories that we serve in our, almost all of our communities that we serve, but also expanding into areas that we never really imagined, or at least didn't think would come this quickly. One example of those is animal husbandry, where we're delivering. different types of, artificial insemination products and, swine, semen and other things to improve livestock health and efficiency of those systems in these communities, which has a really big positive impact on the local economics, and different things within the community and health, within the community. So there's, it's one of those situations where providing, Logistic system and focusing on an initial use case that is really impactful, but then the creativity of our partners being able to identify other ways to use this logistic system to positive impact the community has increased volume and demand in ways that we didn't really think were on the horizon when we first started.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Eric, the 400 deliveries per day, this is with how many drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oof. yeah, sorry.

If I listened to and read properly, they're the ones who were paying for the Eric?.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, we have. absolutely, yes. but in the markets that we operate in, the, either the national level or the state level, depends on the countries and how their healthcare systems are set up. those are our key partners in the from a contract and economic standpoint, I also, would have to give a big shout out to a lot of the other partners that Zipline has, across, to name a couple, Gates Foundation, Gavi, a lot of different foundations that have supported Zipline's ability to get off the ground. in, in these markets and it can continue our operation. So one of the things that we've found is it's really important for success of the integration, into the logistic system to have, really deep buy in and support from the healthcare system that we're partnering with. but also Zipline's really excited whenever we can to bring additional funding into the mix, to, to support those operations. And, there's a lot of very generous organizations around the world that are excited to make a positive impact and see that their, dollars can make a pretty big impact when deployed in partnership with technology like Zipline's.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Eric, how does the experience accumulated in Africa operations translate to your aspirations in the U. S. and specifically how the FAA looks at this experience and, gives for lack of a better word, credit, towards certification and towards operational approvals in the U S what we have heard is not just, relating to Zipline, but, you can extend this, to military operations and other internationally operated, companies that wish to come to the U S that, yes, there's definitely a nod to flight heritage, but at the same time, there's pushback in terms of the operations not really being conducted in the complexity of modern and busy airspace systems, such as the national airspace system in the U. S. and so in your conversations with the FAA, how difficult of a conversation has this been and how have you structured and conducted and analyzed operations in Africa to make sure that it will be. acceptable to the FAA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a good, it's a good one. So two different things here. First is the positive impact on Zipline, we've learned a ton across the operations that we've done to date. we've flown in total commercial operations, serving our partners 65 million miles, more than 65 million miles, which is over 2, 500 times around the globe. I did the math recently, blew my mind. and so that much flight experience brings back a lot of learnings, And so we have continued to improve our product, improve safety, improve operational efficiency, with these learnings, better understand and characterize the environment in which we're operating in, weather at low altitudes, all of these things. So that's one is just that experience, not the for credit side, if you will, but just the product improvement side is really cannot be overstated. And then the second part of the question around. how is that flight experience, leveraged or considered in, in conversations with FAA specifically, I think that there's been somewhat of a shift here over the last few years in my experience where, I think that we're at a place now that the FAA is much more, taking a much more first principled approach, and much more open to those conversations where, depends what we're talking about, If we're talking about trying to take credit for the, the aircraft's ability to fly through rain, then, rain in Ghana is the same as rain in Utah, So it's very similar. and it, it's dependent on different variables, of course, but there isn't anything fundamentally different. And so it really depends on what is the area in which we're attempting to take credit or asking to take credit. And as long as we're coming in with, rigorously evaluating how does this compare, how does this data compare to the claims that we're trying to make and the operations that we're trying to conduct, then we've seen, especially over the last year, a pretty big shift to the FAA being willing and, good partners and evaluating that, asking the right questions about how is this different and how does this compare, but then as long as we're for, as long as we're doing our job from the first principles standpoint of making sure that, this data does compare, that it is useful in demonstrating this safety claim and that we're achieving these high safety bars, then we have had success using some of that data for credit and working towards FAA approvals.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there any aspects of Platform 1 that would prevent it from flying at scale in the U. S.?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>no, there's, yeah, no, there's nothing preventing platform one from flying at scale in the U. S.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right, let's put a pin on Zipline for now. We'll come back to it, especially as we, talk about scaling operations in the U S but let's zoom out a little bit and Eric, when we talked prior to the podcast about, possible themes, you mentioned that you thought we didn't talk enough about the UAS certification paths. So let's spend some time on that. Perhaps start from the top and let's assume that we want to start a drone delivery operation in the U.S. What are the approvals? what are the certification paths for the aircraft, for the operation? Talk us through the current uh, certification path, and also contrast that to what the potential future processes might look like.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So Zipline is a part 135 certified air carrier in the U. S. The, the reason that, that we are is because currently in order to conduct beyond visual line of sight, parcel delivery for compensation, those operations cannot be conducted under part 107 and the regulatory framework for conducting those operations is part 135. we're a proud part 135 air carrier. It comes with a lot of, a high safety bar, a lot of, safety based and operational processes. And the design approval side of that operational certificate that we leverage is, Section 44807 Exemption. And this acts as the design assurance side of what is the UAS, not just the drone, but the system that we're bringing in to conduct those operations under. And this is an area that has, when it comes to part 135 and also the design approval side there's been tremendous progress made over the last year. I think 2023 was a really big year in the U S and in partnership with FAA for not just applying, but I think for the industry as a whole in streamlining the processes towards demonstrating those high safety bars. For the high safety bar for those operations. And we're really excited about the progress that we've made over the last year, as well as we think this is just going to continue, all signs are pointing towards this, just further streamlining and becoming more efficient and I think an important thing that, the FAA in my opinion is really leaning into is, defining and maintaining a high safety bar, which is, all of our goal. but I think the FAA is moving in a direction that is more flexible in the standards and approaches for an applicant to demonstrate that they're achieving that high level of safety, Which I think allows more room for enabling innovation in the space. And I think, this could be in opposition to, or counter to really prescriptive set of requirements, So this is more, I think the FAA is moving towards evaluating what is the level of safety of the proposed operations and is that achieving the safety bar, that we've defined. So there's a shift towards being more into the future. There's an expected movement towards part 108, which is a new regulatory framework that, a draft should be coming out this summer from FAA is what we're hearing and we expect to be a continuation of what we're seeing in the part 135 and 44807 exemption, processes where there'll be further streamlining the approvals that, Zipline and others have worked to achieve under the current frameworks, we'll transition over into that part 108 world. and I think expect a very similar safety bar, but further opportunities for efficiency and demonstrating that level of safety. And I think that, the main change that I expect specifically is a movement towards more statements of compliance from industry to industry standards, consensus based standards. And so that means that there's, those industry standards are really important. And that's an area where Zipline, and others that, that we work closely with are really investing in over this year and into the next year is to make sure that we're set up for success, when the part 108 comes out and things are shifting every, every day they're shifting more towards, how is this approach how is this proposal demonstrating compliance with industry based standards, And so being able to ensure that we're working collaboratively as an industry to set up performance based and first principle safety based standards that then we can demonstrate compliance to is a key part of the future of UAS approvals, in my opinion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the ways that operators obtain a 44807 exemption? Is it typically through the D&amp;R process? Can you talk a little bit about that versus what has emerged as the more streamlined way through the flight standards, office of the FAA?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so Zipline received our first 44807 exemption, through a process that was, different than the current process, I'll say it's an evolving landscape. and that initial approval is carried over into the current method, as far as being grandfathered in, if you will, into the current method. And the current method is a derivative, I would say, of the durability and reliability based approach that you're referencing, where it takes a lot of the, a lot of the components from that, a lot of those same concepts of really thinking about it at the system level, as opposed to, piece part component level, the certification, and design approval. So it's really thinking about the system and let's define the operating environment and the limitations and everything for the system. And let's go demonstrate that this overall system, this UAS can operate safely and repeatedly in that design domain, In that operational environment. And so it is a very similar approach to that durability and reliability approach. I think one of the main differences is that the more classically the durability and reliability approach was done really in partnership, step by step with, FAA and with a lot of FAA oversight, and a lot of FAA agreement on, every document and test plan and all of these things, a lot of witnessing of testing, et cetera. And the new processes are more focused on, being compliant to industry standards and having company statements of compliance to achieving those very similar requirements. but having that slightly different approach has led to an opportunity for, I think, moving change management and initial approvals much more efficiently through the process while still achieving that same high safety bar.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the interesting, moves in my opinion has been, the shift away from dealing with the design. part of the FAA and more with the operational, the flight standards folks, if that is true, if you agree and you see this as well, how are those conversations different?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that there's more of a focus in the last year. Again, there's been a transition within the FAA and how they're handling UAS operations to have more of a focus on evaluating the safety of the proposed operation. And so there can be. that can be very, location specific, there can be different types of mitigations that can be put in place for different types of risk, but it's really thinking about what is the level of safety and is this achieving our collectively high safety bar, or is it not, And I think that is, is a different lens than looking at it from a very certification and compliance perspective. framework, right, of saying what are the specific regulations and is every part of the system in compliance with those regulations, is just a different lens to look through. and yeah, we've been pleasantly surprised with the shift and it's a movement more towards actually looking at the safety of the operations, which is more directly aligned with what I think we all care about at the end of the day. And so I think it's been a really positive shift.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what's the latest in evaluating the safety of the associated elements? What was it, maybe two summers ago that the famous memo landed and the industry, was very surprised. What was your experience like in proving safety and, obtaining approvals for, things like C2 Ground Control Stations. and how is the FAA dealing with it now?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that the. I think approach to associated elements that the FAA decided to take a couple years ago, is much more aligned and works much better with the more current approach of evaluating the safety of the proposed operation. I think it was a bit of a challenge to figure out how we then, handle different associated elements, different parts of the system with respect to showing compliance, to the set of regulations on the design side. But when, with a shift more towards saying, what are the proposed operations and what's the safety of these operations, then it becomes more, it's just more flexible, I think it's just a more flexible lens to be thinking through. And so we've seen, yeah, I think a fair amount of success of having the UA, the aircraft and the associated elements, all being considered as a part of the operation. and when it makes sense to treat them the same, we treat them the same. It wouldn't make sense to treat them a little bit differently. We treat them a little bit differently, and be able to have those categories to, to think through from a first principles safety perspective, dependent on what the proposed operation is something I think is working pretty well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You talked about future Part 108 leveraging industry standards. Where are the missing pieces today? Parts of the operations or technology that the industry is yet to agree on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I think when it comes to industry standards, in my mind, there's two different categories of progress that we need to make. One of them is there are just gaps, If you try and piece together all of the standards to, to paint a full picture, to put the mural together, there are some places where there are just some gaps. So those gaps need to be filled. And then I think another opportunity for improvement is, some of the standards that do exist that are, the right standards in the right areas, in some places they're maybe overly prescriptive or refer back to older processes or older approaches to things. And so I do think there's an element of the industry needs to align on updating some of these standards to be more performance based, and more flexible to support innovation in the space. Again, with that eye towards what is the risk level or this level of safety of the proposed operation? And is that achieving the safety bar? that's what matters at the end of the day. So yeah, I'm excited to, to, partner with other folks in industry. I think that, like I mentioned earlier, Zipline's going to be investing here. I would encourage any members of the audience who are potentially interested to get involved in this space. I think there's a big opportunity to move not only, drone delivery, but other drone applications, as well as honestly setting, in a lot of places setting the framework, for autonomous aviation, in a number of places. So I think it's a big opportunity and having, especially there's room for more operators with experience, more manufacturers with experience to, to join some of these conversations to make sure we're moving these standards in the right direction for the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, across those two categories, on industry standards, can you name some that are your highest priorities, whether gaps that need to be filled or standards that need to be revised?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'll put a plug in here there's a, operational risk assessment standard within ASTM that I'm, taking an active role in helping to update. this was a standard that came out in 2016 and we're planning on updating throughout the course of 2024. So this is something that is really an opportunity to look at, like I mentioned, what is that evaluating the safety of the proposed operation in a really smart way, and the industry, I believe, is lacking on the, an agreed upon process for conducting that type of analysis. And that includes, what are some of the equations that we use, what are some of the data sources that we use. And I think that the FAA has made a big step forward in better defining where the safety bar is. one of those, one example being FAA order 8040. 6A that came out late last year, which is, I think does a, is a big improvement to the previous guidance about where the safety bar is and I think industry has a step to take in order to agree upon what are the standard approaches, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the level of safety of the operation. So this is an area where I'm actively involved. There's a number of areas, that we both need to fill in some gaps as well as make some improvements to, to some standards, especially some that are a bit old and maybe out of date.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are any of these gaps or, missing standards, a direct obstacle for the industry to grow over the next one or two years,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the good news is that we're in a transitionary period, right? And so we're still, while part 108 is being developed and putting into practice, we're, we're still operating in this part 135 and section 44807 exemption world. And. That includes a combination, It's a combination of working directly with FAA in some areas and being able to take advantage of some of the standards that do exist in other areas. And no, I don't think that there's anything that is a direct blocker to industry right now. I think it's more of We need to do the work to set ourselves up to fully take advantage of the, process improvement opportunities that are, being, being placed in front of us. So I think that I don't see anything that's a blocker today, but I do see some opportunities to further accelerate, the industry in the future while again, still holding that high safety bar. Finding more efficient ways to demonstrate that level of safety with initial systems, new operations and new environments, design changes, et cetera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you see that the challenges around Boeing are in any way impacting the FAA, either in terms of their bandwidth or their appetite to engage with the UAS industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, not me personally. No, most of the folks that, that we work with at the FAA are, in the kind of emerging technologies side of things and the UAS offices. and yeah, we're, we're excited to have a number of partners on the FAA side who are focused on the UAS space, the companies like, Zipline and others to find the right ways to integrate UAS into their space in a safe and efficient manner. So no, I don't see anything at a day to day level, with the folks that we're working with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric as Zipline came into the United States and you saw how you wanted to monetize your operations here and you saw certification clearly as a hurdle. how was it any different than you thought it would be when you started.

And where we are today I think we're in a pretty good place. I think the industry is in a pretty good place from a, regulatory and technology and level of safety and all of these areas, compared to our expectations when we shifted some of the focus, when we added the focus of expanding into the United States, it's really in kind of 2019, 2020 type timeline. we didn't make as much progress as we hoped, so we got, I think we're at a place that we feel, we're excited about. We think that there's, we're really excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I think it took a little bit longer to get here than we expected to. but yeah, I think that we managed through and really excited about where we are. And I think the industry is in a really right place for innovation and also, scaling in the United States, and beyond over the next few years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And if you said there were two or three things that you took from your Africa experience that helped you operate in the certification world more effectively, what would they be?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think it, I think the main thing, and this is a little bit, zoomed out, but Zipline has always taken the approach of being very first principled when it comes to safety. The first question we ask ourselves when we're trying to go do something new, whether that's a new location, new airspace, new environment, new weather envelope, new aircraft, all these different things. The first thing we ask ourselves is, what is the level of safety that we need to achieve for these operations and how do we have the confidence that we have achieved that? And early on in the program, we'll say, what do we need to do in order to look back and what does success look like in the testing or analysis that we're going to conduct? The next question, once we have that plan, we've identified that level of safety, we've identified the process to get there and convince ourselves. Then the next question is, what's the regulatory pathway, what do we need to show compliance with? What are the regulator expectations? And so I think that's something that isn't fully unique to Zipline, but I think is a little bit unique where a number of aviation companies start off with a compliance mindset. And I think that Zipline was founded on more first principles than that. Starting off with first principles, safety, and then also demonstrating compliance is a key part of it. But making sure that we're setting our own objectives, our own safety bar and ensuring that our operations are achieving that. I think that's something that, is in our DNA, That started back at the beginning of the company and I'm excited to, to see that kind of progress and mature over time, certainly, but I do think it's a key part of ZipLine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric you gave us a high level overview of the P2 platform that's in development. What can you share additionally about the state of the development of that platform?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'd love to rewind the clock a little bit. I'm happy to get there, but in order to get there, I feel like showing a little bit of a origin story, I think might be important to set the stage for how we got to where we are. and so the Platform one system we've talked about a fair amount. Platform 2, we talked about being focused on home delivery in urban and suburban areas. And, this became really obvious to me as a need and the right next step for ZipLine in 2019. When, I was just reflecting recently on when this was exactly. In 2019, I was spending a lot of time in Ghana. working on expanding our operations there in the more kind of remote parts of Ghana and partnership with our, our healthcare partners, operations team, regulators, everyone involved, different airspace operators. And, there was a friend of Zipline, Joe, shout out if you're listening, who kept, he was a doctor, well connected doctor in Ghana and kept reminding me or telling me that, hey, it's great what you guys are doing in the remote parts, but we really need you in the capital city. We need you in Accra. We need you in Kumasi. We need you in these urban areas as well. and I wasn't so sure. I wasn't convinced. and. one thing that Joe did is he said, can I have a day of your time? And I said, yeah, of course. And so he took me around to some of the main hospitals in Accra and walked me into the emergency rooms and some of the places and introduced me and asked the doctors, the folks that, who ran some of those facilities, heads of the emergency room, when is the last time that you didn't have the medical products that you needed in order to, properly care for someone, and even, lost a life of someone that potentially could have been saved if he had the right products. and every one of those hospitals that, that I went to, that, that, kind of Joe brought me to, the doctor had a story within the last 24 hours of when that occurred.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What was the most common answer that they said Was it blood?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most common, yeah, most common would be, yeah, rare blood types, right? Someone in the middle of the night, rare blood type, and just couldn't get it, couldn't find a donor, couldn't find access to the blood bank, in time. yeah, that, that was the most common theme. and so that, that became pretty clear to me that, wow, right, this, we've really been focusing on some of these more remote areas, but there are challenges, not just in Ghana, then we did our homework, we did our homework, looking at other places around the world, and concluded that, hey, this is a, this is also a real challenge. That was, again, for me personally, that was when the light bulb moment happened where I was like, okay, in order for us to accomplish this mission of enabling access to healthcare to everybody in the world, we, we need another solution, right? There's a lot of people who live in urban and suburban areas and we're not serving them properly. And so that was a big movement in that direction. and then, fast forwarding through time, we're, we. Then I've, have been working over the last few years to develop our Platform 2 system. That's focused on solving this problem, Enabling home delivery and operations in urban and suburban areas, with, I think a pretty cool customer experience and delivery experience really focused on, everything you need in order to do that in safety as a top objective, quiet, really. precise and inviting and fun delivery experience. So that's what we've been focusing on. we have a really strong demand, which is amazing to see. We have lots of partners in the healthcare space and the retail space and the restaurant space, a lot of partners, and some of the main feedback that we received from those partners is just, when are you going to launch with us? When can we expand to these customers? and so that's, that's great feedback to have, demand signal from the market. So that demand's great. We've been able to make a lot of regulatory progress. as I mentioned, initial Beyond Visual Line of Sight operations and in the United States late last year, really being something that, that was a big unlock for Zipline. and that was, with our onboard detect and avoid system, being able to allow us to operate in different types of airspace with limited infrastructure on the ground, to unlock those new areas inside and outside of mode C, veil areas. So in, in areas near big airports where there's more requirements for transponding as well as, in areas that are not near big airports where, there's less cooperative airspace. we've now conducted beyond visual line of sight operations in the United States and, both different types of airspace inside and outside Mode C veil, which is huge. There's about a little bit more than half of the United States population lives inside Mode C veil areas. but that also means that a little bit less than half lives outside. and so being able to bring, access and instant delivery to everyone in the world really means we need something that can hit all these different areas. Right. And that, that demand is huge. the regulatory progress we've been able to make, which is, we, we see as a lot of these things being cross platform, it's not an approval for just this specific aircraft in this specific instance, but it's really paving the way, If we have this level of performance of a system, then we agree and we've gotten agreement from the FAA that we can safely operate in these environments. and so now we go design also the next generation aircraft to have, the same or even better level of performance, then, it'll follow that we will to get very similar approvals within the same, part 135 air carrier certificate to operate and add that new aircraft into our operations. And, and yeah, and then as far as where we are in the program, it's just, continuing to develop, bring up the supply chain, manufacturing, flight testing, all of the things that are required in order to set up and have the capacity and capability of the next generation system to be able to meet that demand signal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, you mentioned your conversation with Joe and, you know, I love that story about listen, even in a city, there's a requirement for instant access for certain goods. But how much of your valuation, is a function of your ability to deliver goods to areas that otherwise wouldn't get those goods. You know, whether it be an Africa or whether it be in the United States. Or how much of it is your ability to deliver same day services to the home, for example, where you're now competing in a much more, it's much more of a red sea. Will you always get a better part of your valuation because of your ability to deliver goods that are not easily access to more remote areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's absolutely both. it's absolutely both. I think that there's some really high value use cases that Zipline has been able to serve and, really humbled by the partnerships that we have in order to make those positive impacts in the world so far, and really looking forward to expanding that. I think there's unique value that we can bring into those spaces. with that said, there's also, there are other use cases, And, I, again, it's speaking for myself here. I, pretty recent, I have two little kids at home and pretty recently. I went to the medicine cabinet in the middle of the night in search for some Tylenol to help with a fever. And sure enough, we happened to use the last of the Tylenol the last time that we needed it and had forgotten to get more. and really wished that I could get a drone delivery on my back porch in 10 minutes, in that time. so there, there's those types of use cases\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in that situation, Eric. Great example. What's your competitive advantage? You know, there are a lot of big players now who want to be able to deliver that Tylenol in the middle of the night. Uh, I love how you talk about your ability to quote unquote, you know, deliver on a dinner plate. You're so exact and what you, you can land and because of your droid. But what's your competitive advantage and being able to provide that, is there a cost advantage? I know noise is significant and it's a very quiet aircraft. I know that you can land it on a dime or, you know, on a dinner plate, but why would you be better than somebody else who was also able to deliver that Tylenol in the middle of the night?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, I think there's a number of, I think there's a number of different factors. yeah, my speaking from that experience specifically, right. It's, the way that we're developing Zipline would be a far superior experience to what I experienced that night. just being able to quickly open up an app type in what I'm looking for and have it show up in 10 minutes. It exactly where I want it. Where I, can still just be wearing my pajamas and have my slippers on in the middle of the night. Like that was not my experience, right? The experience was, I was lucky enough to be able to have product delivered, As opposed to having to get in the car and, and go find a 24 hour, pharmacy or whatever it may be. but it. It takes time, So someone's got to be awake looking for that. and then it shows up in a 3000 pound combustion engine vehicle to hand you a, an eight ounce bottle of Tylenol, at your door in the middle of the night. that's just, so some of the things that we're focused on doing are enabling faster, more efficient, more kind of user friendly experiences, as well as being able to deliver on safer, quieter, more environmentally friendly alternatives, right sized for the mission, solutions. And I think that that has a number of different. benefits over the current status quo.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Eric, do you see Platform 2 flying first in the U. S. market, or do you see it flying first in Ghana, against the use case, that you mentioned?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, we're keeping our options open, just to be transparent. we're looking at both, We're looking at both expanding, Platform 2. 0 service in some of the international markets that we currently have, quite a bit of experience in, as well as looking at, bringing the system first to the U S we have strong demand signal in, in multiple geographies and there's uncertainty, there's regulatory uncertainty, there's different types of uncertainty. And so it's just really important for us that we're able to, as fast as we can, deliver on our side of the, bargain with our partners. And so we are keeping our options open and whether or not we go to the US or international first, but I will say that there's been a lot of improvement and a lot of progress made in the US from a regulatory standpoint and also a community acceptance standpoint that we, we've had really positive success with FAA recently, as well as our operations and that we've had in North Carolina, Utah and Arkansas, serving customers and delivering products as have been really well received by the local communities. And that puts the U S on the top of the list, Like that, that, that puts it in the conversation, which is something that in 2016, it wasn't the case, right? In 2016, it really wasn't an option to come to the US first with a new system like this. So we're really excited to see the progress that has been made such that we think that it is a viable option to take a new service like this and bring it to the United States first.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see. Can you share a story with the audience, sort of talking about the design philosophy that has evolved at Zipline, on the basis of starting in 2016? and building Platform 1, taking a very verticalized approach to building it because at that point in time, that was a necessity. And now as you come to design Platform 2, can you tell a story about how that philosophy influenced the design of Platform 2 and perhaps what you guys have learned since you've unveiled it, in terms of development and and testing that's undergone since then?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, this comes back to, I think, this is just a good principle for launching new products and starting new companies is Zipline since the beginning has been focused on providing a service and solving a problem. Not developing technology as the top priority. And so when we started on this mission, we were focused on, enabling access to healthcare and providing an instant logistic system that, that serves everyone equally. And we thought, probably naively that we would be able to go out and buy some drones and buy some, it was the first thought buy some drones and start operating them to, to help, solve these problems quickly realized after buying and testing some drones that wasn't going to work. and so then we thought, okay, we'll be the system integrators. We can go buy, a number of components, avionics, flight control systems, autopilots, assemble them all together, and then we'll have our drones that we can go start solving these problems with and serving these customers. and what we've found over and over again over the years is that, it's really tough to do, It's in order to achieve the levels of safety and reliability that are needed, as well as the kind of efficiency and economics that are needed in order to serve these spaces, we've really struggled in most cases to find off the shelf components that can achieve both of those things, They can achieve the high level of reliability in the really adverse, environmental conditions that we operate in, as well as can achieve the economic efficiency that we need in order to deliver the product that we need in the service that we need to deliver. so that has led to more and more vertical integration and more and more, pulling more components and hardware components, software components, et cetera, in house over time. and I think that's just, we're just doing more of that on the platform two system, as opposed to the platform one system where there are some components on platform one system, even today that we, that we would really like to be able to bring in house. and so we learned on that and kicked off projects to purpose design some of those components for both platform one and platform two. and the, and some of those components are going into platform two first, and then we'll be rolled back into platform one, when we do a design update after they've been proven on the platform two system. Yeah, really excited about some of the opportunities there, and I think that this is a, I think that there's a kind of a, competitive advantages, a bit of a moat here of being able to be a vertically integrated company in this space allows us to achieve the levels of performance, the levels of, safety, these different things that really enable the business and enable the customer experience. I think one more thing I'd add is that answer. The answer I just gave is not just applicable to drones, right? the drone is. a portion, it's an important portion, but it's only a, really a subset, a small subset of the total. Of everything that Zipline needs to do in order to provide our service, right. And if we provide logistic service with our partners, there's also, just to name a few off the top of my head, right. There's the software that's used to manage the fleet of aircraft to dispatch the right aircraft with the right level of battery charge to the right order at the right time. the software that the controllers use, our remote pilots and command use for monitoring the fleet. There's a fulfillment systems that we use to manage inventory. there's integrations with our partners. There's the ordering apps that we build. There's all of the. manufacturing and quality systems. There's, all of the ground systems that we use, the communication systems, all of the things, And Zipline is definitely not a drone company. We're absolutely, a company that provides, logistics services for our partners, and we're really excited about that. and that leads to a lot of vertical integration across the space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, what external companies do you use for any parts that you just mentioned, you know, from UTM to fulfillment and how much of it is home grown and how much are you using partners?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a combination of both. Absolutely. I say that we're quite vertically integrated, but also there are some really important partners that we have that have enabled zipline to make the progress that we have and that we're also excited about continuing to expand with in the future. Happy to name one or maybe a couple, but, I think one that comes to mind first is NVIDIA. Right. we're more and more increasingly, getting higher autonomy on board the aircraft and that requires compute. And so having the latest, state of the art compute on board that can achieve the cost efficiency, mass efficiency, and, compute capabilities that are needed in order to have the, the flying computer that, that a lot of modern drones are has, it's been a great partnership with Nvidia to be able to achieve that and set us up for scaling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about on the UTM side? Is this something that you're doing yourself? Are you using a USS, how does that work?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So on, on the UTM side, so UAS traffic management, we are a part of the Keysight initiative in Dallas and partnership with a number of folks in industry, as well as the FAA and NASA. and we also have, have experience in UTM and in our international markets as well. and Zipline develops our own USS capabilities and, another example of being quite vertically integrated in the space is, developing, building those capabilities to, to interface with other companies and UTM service providers in an efficient way that enables our business.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, quite a number of people that we talked to privately, are expressing skepticism about the P2 design, pointing to the complexity and associated cost of it and wondering whether Zipline can really be profitable in the delivery of low value goods with this kind of platform. What is it that they're missing? How do you respond to something like that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. it's, it's not an easy problem to solve, right? it is a complex, highly integrated system. and we have focused on providing, we focus on that home delivery use case from the beginning of the design and everything that is needed in order to achieve that, the high level of safety and reliability, the, the delivery experience, including really designing for noise, being able to integrate. So we want to be able to integrate really efficiently into our partner facilities to be able to create that. we, the terms we use, create a magical portal in the wall that allows our partners to ship products to where it needs to go really efficiently. So these are some of the aspects that we've been focusing on the design. As far as, some of the potential skepticism, You really need to understand the system that you're designing and what are, what the main levers are, So designing for, autonomy, designing for longevity of the system and, cycles on the airframe, designing for operational efficiency and high utilization. all of these factors, designing for maintenance, right? All, all of these factors are really key and being able to. to bring to life a highly integrated, complex system to be able to serve our partners and achieve the use cases that we're focused on achieving.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are some of the gates either in terms of, utilization or the level of automation or human involvement or, the cost of the overall system, or any other gates that you need to achieve in order to, be able to profitably deliver a cup of coffee with the P2.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, from the beginning, we've designed the system for scale. that means, manufacturing scale, that means operational scale, all of these things. With scale comes economic benefits. and so we're really excited to have, a lot of the partners that we have, across, healthcare space internationally in the U. S. I mentioned, national healthcare system. We're expanding with this later this year and the UK, the Cleveland Clinic in the U. S., and the retail space, Walmart and the restaurant space, Sweetgreen and others. really excited about our partners and how are partners in general are really looking to scale, They're really looking to not just do a demo, do a pilot, see how it's received, but be able to achieve levels of scale. And that's when the economics start to work out, right. Is when you're, is when you're achieving scale with some of these partners and some of these systems, that's when, yeah, the, it can really make a positive impact in the community. And also that's when everything starts to pan out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And when you say scale, what do you assume in terms of utilization of drone, let's say in the unit of hour, is that, 3, 4 deliveries, 5, 6, 7?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I mean, it, depends, right. I'm happy to give some, some rough numbers, but it depends. It depends on how far away you're flying. It depends on the weather conditions. It depends on a lot of factors. But, if we're, we're doing a couple to a few deliveries in an hour, that's a good, that's a good hour for an aircraft. And that includes, getting loaded, flying out to the delivery site, delivering, going back to, get charged and get loaded again. So yeah, being able to do, two, two or three deliveries over the course of an hour is a productive, utilization of the asset.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned NVIDIA and autonomy earlier. It's interesting. We recently saw an interview with ValorEquity, one of your investors. It was a much broader conversation around AI and LLMs, but Zipline came up as an example of the vertical AI investments that this firm is making and how Zipline has an AI advantage. What do you think about this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that our flight experience has allowed us to continually improve our system, understand the environment we're operating in, and continually improve the, reliability, robustness and performance of our systems. and I think that includes. In the autonomy space, That includes in the ability to automate these systems, make them more and more capable and safe and powerful as time goes on. And yeah, I do think that, Zipline does use, artificial intelligence techniques, machine learning, et cetera, in order to. better understand our environment and ensure that we're continually improving the safety and efficiency of our operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How much of AI is used, currently or importantly, how much of it has been used in Africa?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Like I mentioned, we're continually using the flight experience that we have in order to improve the system. And so, yeah, they're, from weather prediction to flight controls, to autonomy and perception. There's artificial intelligence that we've deployed in different aspects of the business where it makes sense. Again, coming back to the basics where. we're not a company that's focused on developing technology because for the sake of developing the technology, right, we're focused on providing a service, and really scaling our operations and the value we're able to provide. And so I do think that we have taken a pretty pragmatic approach to leveraging. artificial intelligence and advances in those spaces in order to further the mission and continually improve safety operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Got it. Eric, as you think about, scaling the operations in the U. S., what do you consider as some of the top strategic decisions, whether this is, where to go, what geographies or, the depth of, of the experience and the capacity, or, the partnerships that you need to create. What's top of your mind from a strategic perspective?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I spend a lot of time thinking about this. I think one of the things that is really important to me and to us, as we're thinking about expanding more in the United States, specifically, is Identifying the markets and the partners and the airspaces and, the weather conditions and all these areas where we can provide an excellent customer experience. And an excellent partner experience. And, and the good news is that there's quite a few of those. it's not everywhere in the world, But there's quite a few of those where we have conviction that, that this year we're able to expand into a lot of these areas and so being able to just being really thoughtful about how do we expand the business in the right communities with the right use cases in order to set up that kind of, magical first experiences with the community and with our partners to be able to have those positive first impressions and then be able to layer on and expand and scale from there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about, relationships with, the likes of, the aggregators like DoorDash? Do you see competing with them or perhaps, partnering with them like, Manna has been rumored to have done in the U. S.?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, we see a ton of demand, for people just want faster deliveries, straight to their doorstep with a great customer experience. There's tons of demand in the space and I think there's different ways to integrate into, that last mile logistics spaces. A lot of our partners, like I mentioned, are in the healthcare world, for both deliveries to, pharmaceuticals to homes, for example, but also for Inter facility transfers of, samples and different things to improve healthcare efficiency, which we're really excited about, but also in the, in the retail and in the restaurant space, there's, like I said, there's different ways that we, that we could integrate in, that a drone delivery system can integrate in. Currently our partnerships are with the, the service providers directly. So we're working with Walmart, we're working with Sweetgreens, we're working with these different, retail and restaurant companies directly to provide, delivery services directly to their customers. So that, that's where we fit into the space, but, yeah, we're just excited to, to make the biggest impact we can to enable, drone delivery and positively impact the environment and these communities. And so we're, we're open minded to figure out the best way to do that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Eric, when you work with these partners and when you think about the rate at which you expand the service offering. What do you see as the rate limiters to the expansion of drone delivery? Certainly in contrast, DoorDash itself was able to expand very rapidly, just because of the nature of the service. But with drone delivery and with the people and infrastructure that you need to put in place, what are the expectations, for what that's going to look like, the rate, and also will it be concentrated on a geographic basis, city by city, or will it be initially more spread out and then filling in with capacity over time?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good question. I think that, I think it's going to be somewhere in between, right, on both of those. So I don't expect that drone delivery will expand like micro mobility did where they're seemingly we woke up one day and there were scooters all over the sidewalks in some places. I think that drone delivery will be very thoughtfully expanded in partnership with, the federal government, with FAA and other partners, as well as with, the local community, but I also think that there's an opportunity to scale pretty quickly, So I think thoughtfully and, metro by metro or neighborhood by neighborhood, but I do think that there's an opportunity to grow pretty quickly. And as far as the, Go wide and fill in or go deep type question. I think the most likely answer is somewhere in between where, there's two, I think there's two different pulling factors. I'm not sure what the ideal answer is or the optimal solution is, but one factor is that as you build a pretty deep network in one Metro, there's benefits of that network, right? There's benefits of being able to provide quite a bit of service. different infrastructure, charging, logistics, all of these things that you really can provide more and more service more and more efficiently in those communities as you go deeper, which might lead you to, go deep in a place before going wide into multiple. But at the same time, we're super excited about the partners that we've, been working with recently and we'll be working with over the next couple of years, and a lot of those partners are regional, especially on the healthcare side, they're operating in certain areas. And so there's a pull from our partners to be able to grow and scale and launch quickly. And so I think there's going to be a bit of both where we'll go into one metro area, work on going reasonably deep, and then, jump in the next, jump in the next.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, what is the next five to 10 years look like in our industry? And how is it different than what most people are talking about today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:14:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I think it comes back to the kind of opening of the conversation where I think one of the main misconceptions is that drone delivery is, and, scaling UAS is somewhere off on the horizon. And there's a number of obstacles that are in the way. and I think that, really it just depends where you live, There are places in the world where drone delivery is here today and is dependent upon. And my expectation of what the next five years, 10 years looks like is, I'm really excited for being able to bring that to more and more communities, So I think that there's different types of aircraft that are, executing drone deliveries in different markets, different niches, that are all, working efficiently together in order to help everyone live a better, more efficient life for the environment, for, safety, for all of these things. So I'm really excited about the, and optimistic about what the future holds in this space and how it can integrate into the next five to 10 years of our life as we grow.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:15:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you've been part of a very successful company for many years. You know, it started in 13 or 14. What advice would you give to our innovators? Our entrepreneurs that are listening. That may be unique.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:15:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the main piece of advice is to an entrepreneur getting started today would be to tackle a real problem, I think that, it's all too often that an entrepreneur comes about with a technology or with a solution, and then they spend their time looking for a problem to solve. As opposed to coming in and identifying, whether that's through their own personal experience and pain points, or, through insight they may have into the market, being able to identify a real challenge and a real opportunity. and I would just recommend entrepreneurs to, to make sure that you're identifying that challenge, identifying the opportunity and staying focused on burning down the risk to making that successful, As efficiently as you possibly can. and sometimes that includes technology development. Sometimes it may not. but just making sure that we're, efficiently focusing on solving the problem we set out to solve.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:16:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you certainly did that in Africa. Listen, I've heard a Keller, your CEO and he delivers a really inspirational message. And their problem you guys targeted and how you solve that problem. I wanted to ask given the time you've spent in Africa, Eric, what message would you give to Americans\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:16:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good one. There's just so much, it's so interesting and you have to go experience it yourself, I guess would be my main message. there's so much that's different, but there's so much that's the same, and so it's hard to explain the, that, that spread of where at some, in some ways it's the same problems in the same world and in other ways, it's just so different. I think you can say that about, probably any two, two countries and different communities and, cultures and whatnot. But, but yeah, it's just been such a pleasure to, work with, the partners that we have and the communities that we've been fortunate enough to be able to make an impact in those spaces and in our own way.

I was in a lot of design reviews in which I would go, look, we're not going to spend all this money, hundreds of millions of dollars, to come up with an electric airplane that doesn't have the performance of a Robinson, okay?

Welcome back to The Vertical Space and a terrific conversation with John Langford, CEO of Electra. John has over 30 years of experience in this space, so he knows what's been done and believes he has an elegant, smart approach to our industry with Electra. We talk about the key drivers for, and what becomes first in advanced air mobility and how factors such as market acceptance, use case, certification, tech readiness, and infrastructure requirements dictate what type of vehicles will fly first with commercial relevance. We extensively discussed eSTOL its advantages and disadvantages compared to other proposed vehicle types of today. He explains that most use cases don't need pure vertical or hovering. John explains why Electra decided to use blown lift, STOL technology and hybrid electric power. He discusses how there are no mode changes in Electra's aircraft. And that's why he believes Electra has several advantages. We discuss Electra, its unique characteristics and market fit. Listen to what use cases they're targeting with a soccer field sized operating spaces. And John's response to Luka's questions of the regulatory path of landing and taking off from a soccer field. He also makes clear that there'll be selling and not operating their aircraft. John mentions that pure electric does deliver on the promise of low noise and that the hybrid power may require pure electric in different areas and use cases. We then discuss Aurora Flight Sciences, why they started what they did for the first decade and their challenges, their pivot and trigger point for their success the importance of Global Hawk. And their years of subsequent success and their eventual acquisition by Boeing. Listen, we enjoyed this conversation for a variety of reasons, but one standout is that no other guest has referenced as many of our podcasts and guests as John has in this conversation. So, John, thanks for joining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy this conversation with John Langford, as you innovate in The Vertical Space.

John Langford, welcome to The Vertical Space. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's great to be here. Thank you.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First question we ask everyone, is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, if you judge by the responses to the SFARs that were put out last summer, we at Electra have a pretty different view than much of the industry on what those SFARs said. So I would start with that. There's three big pieces that are fundamental to that in the SFARs. The first is reserves. The second is training and particularly the use of onboard pilots and two seats. And the third is the whole issue of a powered lift category and a special type cert Our response to the SFARs that the FAA put out, the draft for comment, there were sort of two people who responded in favor of it, Electra and the Airline Pilots Association. And then pretty much everybody else came, came out against it and, and saying that it would be, everything from, an inconvenience to an industry killer. And you've had a lot of the other guests, on there who've spoken, to that, in the past. on our part, from Electra's point of view, I think the reserves, the issue of reserves speaks to the whole fundamental issue of electric propulsion, how it really fits into aviation, whether it's ready for prime time, and I assume it's something we'll spend a lot of time on today. But, I do think the issues on reserves, on training, and on the powered lift types are, are three things that clearly the industry and Electra probably take different views on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, just go into a little more detail on each if you could.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it was interesting at the Honeywell summit, which you guys were at and did a piece on. one of the eVTOL's CEOs made a comment to the effect that a requirement for 45 minute reserves, they couldn't even fly for 45 minutes, much less have 45 minutes of reserves. And, we nodded and said, yeah, that's what we've been saying for five or six years. And, and so the question of, do you make airplanes fit into the current regime? And, that includes the sort of safety regime. Or how much do you modify the environment to fit the capabilities or lack of capabilities of the new, aircraft. And I think that's really a really central issue. I can spend, I'd like to spend, in, in just a second, a fair amount of time on, a quick view of electric propulsion. But I think reserves are really fundamental and the reserves are not arbitrary numbers that have been made up, they're something that has been developed over many years and proven by experience. They'll probably will need to be somewhat modified for some of the new capabilities, but, I think you, you face a big sort of dichotomy in the aviation world today where the standards of safety are so high in the Part 25 world, and people project that to all other phases of aviation, and then to start right off with saying, well, we have to modify the existing safety regime in order for these new airplanes to work at all should give people pause. And certainly at Electra, the whole business plan is built around the assumption that we have to operate in today's regulatory environment, in today's airspace because the way you get a return on an investment is to, minimize the amount of time that investment is sitting out there before it can produce revenues. And so our whole business plan is designed to fit into the existing regulatory structure as it is, today. And I think that's a pretty big difference between us and most of the other players in the AAM, the new entrants into the AAM market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, have you heard any credible arguments in favor of changing the reserve requirements? Is there something about the concept of operations or the flight environments that are different from when those reserves were initially determined? And by the way, do you know the history of how the industry converged on 30 minutes for VFR, 45 for IFR\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you've asked the other guests that question, and I'll give you the same answer they did, which is no. ha\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you for listening.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's no real physics based argument and I know a lot of people are going we're gonna be flying short distances and we're gonna know where all the landing sites are all the time but you know as a former glider pilot and somebody at Electra, we spend a lot of time looking at landing sites and when we talk about Electra, that's a big part of what we're doing is opening up new places to operate out of. And while there are a lot of landing places, there are not infinite numbers of possibilities where you can conduct a, a safe, non emergency landing, and we are not trying to build, a chairlift here, right, which operates from one point to another point and nothing in between, we think that what you have to have is a system that can go anywhere. A lot of What Electra's focus is to decarbonize aviation, but also to expand the places aviation can operate. And, and if you're going to do that, you cannot have something where you are built around assumptions that you always know where you're starting. You always know where you're ending and you're operating like a chairlift or something.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You talked about, training as the second.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, the Electra airplane is built with two seats up front. It is intended as a, single pilot operation, nine seat aircraft. But there are two piloting stations up front. Now that initially came from just listening to our customers. Many of whom said, look, the kinds of things we want to do with this airplane includes building time as part of the pilot training pipeline, right, the, and so our customers want to use it as a training tool, a tool for building time as pilots move up from ab initio trainers, which that's not what we're building, but we assume you're already a licensed pilot by the time you get into this. But that you build time in order to move up towards the 1, 500 hour number and, that's part of what the customers want to see. And so that's very consistent, I think, with the FAA's approach that while they think simulator training is great, particularly for upset training, they still want you to have time with an experience, with a, be able to do check rides, right, in the airplane. And, I agree with that. I certainly I've heard the arguments, oh, well, F 35s, are single seat airplanes, but most of the military airplanes historically, even the single seaters, there's some two seat version that you work up to, and the military doesn't start you off in those super high end airplanes. So we looked at it. We think it's just extremely prudent, to be able to use this as a training device, even though it's certified and we expect most of the revenue operations will be flown single pilot. The third is the powered lift certification piece where, you know, it's goes back to the V 22 thing, and this is one of the questions that I ask anecdotally, but have never really gotten a great answer to, which is the V22 and the AW609 have very long, very expensive development histories behind them by teams of people who were well funded and knew what they were doing, and have struggled to get into certification. The AW609 is still working on that and there are unique things about airplanes that have these mode changes that fly from vertical flight profiles to horizontal flight profiles in that transition, and while a lot of that will certainly be masked in the flight control systems, it is still a very different animal. When we built the Electra airplane, one of the key advantages that we think is that there are no mode changes in what we're doing. It's a conventional airplane with a wing, from the beginning of the flight to the end of the flight. and that is, the basis of a lot of, what we think are the both operational efficiencies, which translates into costs, and also operational safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You in one of your presentations, John, caught my attention. There's a reason why the President's flying in a helicopter and he's being escorted by two V 22s.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, and we saw that yesterday at Manassas. The president came out to give a speech close by and Marine One flew right into the terminal there and it was a helicopter older than, well, not all of us on this call, but many of the people who work at Electra, those helicopters are older than, but yeah, absolutely, if the concept's not safe enough for the president of the United States to fly on, why is it safe enough for me to put my kid or my mother on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, John, an elemental stem cell question, what comes first in advanced air mobility? What drives the need for the first commercial vehicle?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it all starts with an air vehicle that works, and I can't think of another time in aviation where we're talking about certification and huge expenditures on new infrastructure for an airplane no passengers have flown on and we have no passenger feedback about whether people are even going to want to fly on these aircraft. So I'm a big believer that what comes first is you gotta make the airplanes work, and that means not flying them just in private tests, but actually in public use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the point you need to be able to roll out a vehicle that's actually going work. So many the use cases in advanced air mobility you would think could be more economically and safely addressed with eSTOL versus eVTOL. Talk about that a little bit. You've already highlighted in this conversation, there's a lot of challenges with vertical lift. You talked about cost but I'm sure you will. But there's a safety concern in the transition, but it seems like an awful lot of the missions in regional air mobility, and in other areas that they can be better served by the eSTOL.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, let me talk a little bit about how we came to the idea of Electra and it was through building a lot of eVTOL airplanes. At my previous company, Aurora Flight Sciences, we can talk more about Aurora in a second, but we were primarily in a rapid prototyping operation, we built all kinds of advanced aircraft concepts, and that's what we offered to our customers. And we did electric airplanes really from day one, or we tried to, right? The very first airplanes we started building in 1989 for high altitude use were intended to be electric originally. In fact, battery electric using, one shot lithium thionyl chloride batteries to, to get to very high altitude so you didn't have to build an air breathing propulsion system that worked at 85, 000 feet. In about the mid 2000s, starting in about 2002 and then flying in 2009, we did a hybrid electric airplane called Excalibur for the Army that had a gas turbine and a generator and three electrically driven lift fans that also had batteries. And then we did a program for DARPA that was called the XV 24 Lightning Strike, which was a very large turbine driving generators, 3 megawatts worth of electricity, driving 28 fans buried in the wing. It ended up being a tilt wing to get the, the high speed and the VTOL, working together in that. And as part of that program, we also did a subscale demonstrator, which was purely battery powered and autonomous. And we used that to demonstrate the full flight envelope. And then we went from there into a program with Uber, which for an airplane that we called the Pegasus and Boeing called the PAV. And then we did a proprietary program with, with Porsche. So we built a lot of eVTOLs of almost every configuration you can imagine and everyone that's out there and some that aren't. And when we went to go study how to put it into production, we spent a lot of time trying to come up with a design that could beat existing airplanes. I was in a lot of design reviews in which I would go, look, we're not going to spend all this money, hundreds of millions of dollars, to come up with an electric airplane that doesn't have the performance of a Robinson, okay? We never were able to do that with, battery electric designs, but what did happen was some guys up at MIT, John Hansman and Mark Drayla and one of their grad students, Chris Corton, began to say, hey, look, for most use cases, it does not have to be strictly vertical, right? What you really care about is the runway independence. There are some cases where you have to hover, where you need that pure vertical, or you need that pure hover capability. You always will, and so those will be the province of, of, helicopter designs, but in most other cases, every other case that doesn't have that absolute requirement for vertical or hovering, you're better off with the physics of a wing, and a wing is essentially a thrust multiplier, whereas with a VTOL design, all of the lift is provided by the thrust, so you know, you have to have thrust higher than your weight. And in a normal airplane, what a wing does is act as a thrust multiplier. So if you have a 10 to 1, lift to drag ratio, you can get away with 1 10th the thrust that you would need if you were trying to take off vertically. And, that gives you a physics advantage that, is why most airplanes that you see are, what we call CTOL, or you use a wing throughout the entire flight envelope. The science that Electra is harnessing in this is a technique called blown lift, which is something that has been around for, oh, 50 years or more, since NASA in the 60s and then 70s really pioneered it, and the French and the Japanese, and there were some Air Force programs that looked at this. By blowing the wing, bathing the wing in carefully designed flap systems and with the higher velocity air from the propulsion system, you could get lift coefficients that were multiples of what you could get from a conventional sort of static configuration system. So instead of getting, a lift coefficient of two and a half, you could get lift coefficients approaching ten. And if you can do that, you can fly much slower, and if you can fly more slowly, you can take off and land in very short distances. Blown lift as it was developed in the 60s and 70s was always that it was being done with gas turbines. And gas turbines, are basically, well, if you look at the history of CTOL airplanes, we've gone from four engines to three engines to two engines, and people would go to one gas turbine if they could, obviously they don't because of the redundancy need to be able to lose one at takeoff, but, you essentially pay for the maintenance cost by the gas turbine. So the blown lift wants continuous blowing across the wing in an infinite number of propulsors and the gas turbines want to have one propulsor. And so that was fundamentally the problem of, the early blown lift designs was they were never economical matching with the propulsion systems that are available. The insight that Hansman and Drayla and Corton brought to this was that distributed electric propulsion actually solves that problem. And so with the electric motors, you can now have good specific power and good efficiencies on a number of small propulsors and, the exact number you have to optimize, but a lot more than two, we have eight on the airplanes that we're doing, which matches very well to the requirements of blown lift. And so that's the fundamental physics behind what Electra is trying to do. It gives you a two to three times the useful load fraction compared to a vertical lift design, for a given vehicle weight and a given mission. And then we spend that advantage in a couple of ways. We spend some of it in, we have a better useful load fraction than a VTOL design. But we also spend some of it in things like development costs and in manufacturing costs that we're focused on how you reduce the non recurring costs by not being highly vertically integrated, but by using more COTS components, and I don't mean commercial COTS, just other aerospace level components, and we can talk more about that, and then in the recurring, we're, we have not settled yet in the production of how much is going to be composite and how much is going to be metal, but, we don't have to use the ultimate lightweight solutions that the VTOL folks get driven to because we have that physics advantage that we can spend in a couple of different ways. And overall, we think it's going to make a much more cost effective proposition both for the operators and as a business than anything else we have been able to come up with, and that includes, as I said, looking at pretty much every eVTOL concept, out there. So that was the genesis of when I, left Aurora and started Electra about three years ago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So John, you were looking for design and you saw this insight that distributed electric propulsion enables a really effective blown wing design. What beyond that helped you refine that down into a product and commit to that product? What mission set did you want to go and target with this aircraft?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we started with the whole suite of urban and regional air mobility missions. One of the beautiful things about the eSTOL, particularly when you couple it with the hybrid electric propulsion, essentially the blown lift gives you the very short runway capability, and the hybrid gives you the ability to go long distances, and in this case, long distances is hundreds of miles. And so we look at the whole set of missions. One of the things we, announced this week is we've crossed the 2, 000, pre orders, or letters of intent for the 9 seat airplane that we're developing. And you just look at the range of folks who are buying that and what they are planning to do with it. And it basically breaks out into helicopter operators. Our launch customer was Bristow, one of the world's premier helicopter operators. The people who really understand both the pluses, but also the minuses particularly in terms of cost and noise of helicopters today, and we believe we can operate at 70 percent less direct operating costs than the helicopters they're flying today, and to get in and out of all of the heliports, for example, that ring Manhattan. And so the first people who are really interested in that are the helicopter operators, right? Then we move into, the second category, sort of regional air service providers who want to expand the number of destinations that they go to. The kinds of things that we're offering, if you can get in and out of a soccer field sized location there are a lot of things you can do around the world. Our level zero requirement, as we call it, is to be able to get in and out of Wall Street Heliport, right? That facility is what we have chosen as sizing our capability, that's where the 300 foot by 100 foot operating space comes from in our requirements is that existing piece of infrastructure at the Wall Street Heliport. And there's space at the other heliports that ring Manhattan for that as well, although like at 30th Street West, you can't actually fly directly into that today. There's a barge that's big enough that would have to be refurbished, and there's a horizontal space parallel to the river at 30th Street that is large enough, but has a temporary building in the center of it, but the Wall Street Heliport you can fly in and out of today is the idea, and everybody in this market is talking about the airport shuttle mission to go from Wall Street to JFK or to Newark or whatever. That's what Blade does today and we start with that mission and we can certainly do that mission and we can do it at significantly lower cost than Blade is doing it today with the helicopters. But then we can keep going with the airplane and you can go to the Hamptons or to Martha's Vineyard or Boston. Or you can keep going further and you can go to Washington, D. C. We spend a lot of time working that route between New York and Washington. Because if you look at that today, it's about four hours at a minimum. No matter how you go, whether you drive, take the train, fly commercial, it all starts at four hours and goes up depending on what kind of delays you may encounter. And the only way to, to really save time is to get in closer. This is not a case where going faster in the airplane really makes that big of a difference. You can take a private aircraft from D. C. up to New York, but you're going into Teterboro or Westchester and you've still got to get down to Manhattan, so our view is you've got to be able to get into Manhattan with whatever device you're talking about and that's what our level zero requirement is. Once you can do that, then you can go all kinds of places. You can go to, places like Santa Monica, which are existing airports, but which, carriers like JSX can't get into today, but which they would love to access and which we can because of both the space and the noise that we the quiet operations and the short field operations will be able to do non interfering approaches into places like into big airports JFK, but will also be able to operate off of the tops of parking garages which will allow us, we think, to get into places like Tyson's Corner, which is, a couple miles from where I'm sitting. It'll allow us to operate out of big warehousing distribution centers. It'll allow us to go into destinations, like islands that don't have airports that might have ferry service or helicopter service, but don't have an airport for a fixed wing service. There's actually a lot of those out there. Obviously, it allows you to do every road as a runway. today roads are emergency runways for airplanes, of course. But in the medical evacuation or in the defense applications, we use a lot less road than others. And the 300 by 100 foot is about the size of a soccer field, and if you go and look around the world at how many soccer fields there are and where they are it's amazing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If I was building an aircraft that was range constrained, I could only effectively go 25 or 30 miles in my mission, then yeah, I would focus on these urban centers finding a way to make that mission profile work from downtown to the airport and all of that. But that comes with so much baggage and you have an aircraft that is far more versatile. And so why even focus on those missions first? The last few things that you mentioned, going to places that people want to get to, but there isn't a small airport there, to me, that seems like such a layup for you. And why not focus on that first? Or maybe you don't care. Maybe you're just in the business of selling airframes and the customers will fly them where they will.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the other things that we are adamant about is that we're not the operator. We're not trying to be our own user. We are going to, established other customers and that's part of that 2000 pre orders is it's something like 40 different customer organizations, and one of the beauties of those pre orders is it puts you inside an NDA veil that you can, operate where you can tell them what you're really doing and they can tell you what they want to do and what they're really doing and the things that they want, the features that they want on their product and, and that is, that's basically what we're focused on is listening to the customers, and making sure we deliver what they want. At the same time, you have to have a visionary element as well to it. It's the Steve Jobs iPhone, analogy, right? That people aren't really good at market research because it doesn't really help you on things that don't exist today because people don't really know what they want if they've never had one. And so we're balancing that, right, between the existing missions, which will be the early adopters, some of which are even literally direct replacements for airplanes that are in the fields today, and the expansion markets that are enabled by the new capabilities that airplane offers. We think that's one of the things that makes it such a robust plan, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. think you're bringing forward a versatile aircraft that you put it in the hands of the customers and let them show how they're going to use it, rather than, of the other companies in the space being so prescriptive with this incredible new set capabilities. And they have very narrow vision how end users going access. I'm a big fan of letting the industry discover how customers are going to use it by putting a versatile platform in their hand and something that's really multi mission capable and then watch them apply it and learn from that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We absolutely agree with you.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>what is the, regulatory path to landing an aircraft in a soccer field?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you can do it today with a helicopter, right? It's the same, structure there is on, operating on the same flight rules and stuff as helicopters are today. The, the joke in the helicopter the field is you can land a helicopter anywhere once and, and honestly, as we look at our business plan, particularly for some of the things like where you're dealing with, establishing commuter services to towns, to communities that don't have an existing airport, or you're going to do, package e pickup or delivery to not just between distribution centers, but even to retail stores, that we think that the local regulations will be an important part of this. And that's why we go back constantly to the noise, right? And why we go back constantly to the need to get these things out there and, and begin to demonstrate. And, I think what happened a few weeks ago in New York when Joby and Volocopter did demonstration flights off of the Wall Street heliport and they were very warmly received. And there's always some laws of unintended consequences right, when people say hey that's really, yeah, that's really quiet, that's all these other guys, right, say, now that option exists, we're not going to let into our space, That\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>be\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>things that you see,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, I want to ask you a quick question given you brought up the noise. what's your noise signature versus Joby? say\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>signature is.

And, there's probably people listening to podcast right now, some of whom may be critics of eSTOL. So give a little bit of a flavor first of all, what's the noise difference? Would electric eVTOL companies say, I have a significant noise advantage over eSTOL, or at least a hybrid eSTOL, which you have? And then just give us a quick rundown on what would the critics of eSTOL say overall?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, let me start out with the promise of lower noise is definitely one of the promises of electric that I think electric can deliver on, right? There's a lot of hype and promise around electric aviation in general, much of which I think will be very hard for that people to deliver on, and we can talk about that more in a second, but I think noise is one of the ones that really will, because the motors are definitely quieter. If you have a lot of small props, you can have lower tip speeds, and then the design of the props is, advanced quite a bit. So there, there's no question that these things are going to be a lot quieter. Will the difference between the eVTOL and an eSTOL pure electric mode, will you be able to tell? I doubt it. I don't have specific numbers today. It's all aspect, angle dependent and stuff. But I will say that in the flying we're doing today, we do have a chase plane and you never hear the electric airplane if the chase plane is in the air. We are collecting noise data on that, and it's great, and, we're super excited about that. I think the electric airplane promise of lower noise will be delivered on by everybody. On the hybrid, obviously we have a generator on there, a turbo generator in our case. It's small and we're working to make it quiet on the two seat tech demonstrator that we're flying today it was designed to be inexpensive, so that turbo generator is not particularly quiet, but the airplanes are designed to be flown, and we've tested this, that's why we did our first flight purely electric, because, we are working to make sure in all modes, it's extremely quiet, but we recognize that there are some cases when you want to be, completely our airplane can operate without the turbo generator on. And the analogy I give on that is, is, with your, a Prius, right? When you pull out of the driveway, you're probably operating purely electric, and when you get out on the freeway, the, gas engine kicks in and that's how you get the range. And I think operationally you're going to see a similar thing with the hybrid airplanes. In cases where there's an extreme noise sensitivity, like some of the military missions or some of these close in neighborhood missions, you'll probably will be flying them purely electric for the part where you're low. The other big thing of course besides emitting noise is how much are you emitting at the source, and then what is the trajectory, right? One of the ways that the big turbofans really benefited noise reduction on current jets, of course, is that when you had two of them, you climb a lot faster than the older jets did, and therefore you get away from the ground, and therefore you expose a lot less, surface area. And the eSTOL does that as well with the steep approaches in both, both for takeoff and landing, that, that's another factor in how you minimize the ground exposure. It's also another thing most people don't realize about the eVTOL airplanes, which is that everybody pictures them taking off and landing straight up and down. That's not how helicopters work, but the big thing on the eVTOLs is you take off vertically, but then you've got to get on the wing as fast as possible\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's talk about eSTOL safety case and how you are going to approach safe, slow flight, let's take, final approach with the aircraft. What is final approach speed and what are the safety concerns you and the team had to overcome with that and what do you expect is going to need to be accounted for in the certification process for this? And we talk about, slow speed control, we talk about wind shear, talk about power loss on final approach. Walk us through that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. One of the interesting things about a powered lift airplane, about the eSTOL operation, is that the stall speed is no longer a function just of the geometry of the airplane, the way it is in a normal conventional CTOL airplane. What's the flap setting, right? And that's, that's going to pretty much determine the stall speed. In our case, it's also a function of throttle setting, because of the blown lift. With the blown lift, you're flying at speeds considerably below the power-off stall speed. We are expecting to be operating, 30 to 35 knots in the approach regime of these airplanes. That means that if you're coming into a place like the Wall Street Heliport, you have to have multiple levels of redundancy in the powertrain. And that is one of the beauties of, the, of distributed electric.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, so approach to safety is that we're not to allow the power to fail through redundancy and reliability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's eight motors, there's four batteries, there's two generators, and there's one turbine in, in those, and it's sized so that if you lost the turbine on a critical part of the approach you have, more than enough battery capability. Even if one of the battery systems fails, one of the strings, one of the buses, you can lose two motors in any, scenario. And that's to handle the extreme STOL, and obviously, one of the other beauties of this design at its heart, it's a conventional airplane with a fixed wing and so A complete power loss situation in a a battery vertical lift airplane, you're gonna come down. And, in the electro eSTOL concept, you're going to glide down. That's a much safer situation. We saw that just last week, in Loudoun County, not far from here. a Caravan coming out of Dulles. And so, we think that's an important, safety feature.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the other aerodynamic risk factors in slow speed flight in the traffic pattern on final, that your aircraft needs to designed around?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, obviously one of the things about flying slow is wind and turbulence. One of the really great things about the electric propulsion, and this is again why we think it's the marriage of distributed electric and blown lift that really is the enabler to make all this work, is that you can now use the different electric propulsors as part of your control system, and in fact, we, we do that in the design that the differential thrust, for example, is mixed right in to, the yaw control and also into the roll control and it's actually a strong pitch actuator as well and well, so you have tremendous control effectiveness that you don't have in a normal airplane, where the control get squishier the slower you go, and ultimately, you lose control authority. That's, that does not happen on these blown lift airplanes. That's one of the advantages of this is that you have very powerful control actuators all the way through the flight envelope. And we plan to use them. That's one of the ways you handle, gusts and turbulence and things like that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so how does this apply toward preventing one wing from stalling and causing a spin and et cetera? Will this system be designed to account that and prevent that as part of the envelope protection?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is power by wire, first off, and then the entire airplane is a fly by wire, and while I think pretty much every, you get arguments about how much autonomy people have in the AAM space, but I think pretty much everybody buys into the idea that it's a fly by wire system, and so much so that we often don't comment on that or talk about it. But, I would just note that at the moment there are no Part 23, certified fly-by-wire systems. There are in military jets, there are in bigger airplanes, but the certification piece of that is, important and is significant. It doesn't have challenges of autonomy, the unknown pieces but it also shouldn't be taken for granted. What you get out of FBW is the ability to have protection throughout it, just as you do on the A320 or the big jets. And that'll be a big part of this. Absolutely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. And then with respect to my last, question on this is, low level wind shear. What does that present for this type of very slow flight? What type of risk does low level wind shear present? The airplane perhaps finding itself on short final, an increased sink\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you need to be especially wary of at these types of speeds how do you solve for\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>that? That, that is one of the things that we are looking at It's related to the other piece of this is the precision touchdown, part, that it's, it's pretty easy to take off of a, in 150 feet on a 300 foot space, it's pretty easy to take off in those conditions, and landing, if you need only 100 or 150 feet of ground roll, that's not too bad. But if you've only got 300, you've got to hit the space exactly. And so that's one of the real, that we see as one of the challenges in this. And that's where, while there's no autonomy per se in this airplane, there's a lot of automation and a lot of work is going into the pilot guidance and exactly what roles the pilot is playing and the flight computer is playing. Hitting a precise touchdown point. There is no flare planned for what we're doing, okay, so we come straight in, if you have an aim point, we're gonna hit that, but your point is, well, do you know the atmospheric profile between here and there? And that is a research topic on whether we are going to, in some cases, need you know, a LIDAR profiler or some kind of atmospheric profiler in these, very very short spaces. We are trying hard not to because we are big believers in light infrastructure but we have not ruled out that you might need to put some kind of atmospheric profiler at these very small spaces, particularly if there's large building obstacles or stuff around, so you could feed forward, essentially in real time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, so you're saying it's really these extremely small landing spaces where this becomes stringent because otherwise if there's wind shear day and you're landing on thousand foot runway you just increase your approach speed like airplane would you account for it that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, exactly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, tying back to one of the comments Peter made earlier about the market opportunity outside of these 300 foot balanced field lengths, have you given thought to the idea that maybe this is too complex tackling some of these issues and there's enough of a market opportunity in some conventional missions where you're introducing an aircraft that has significant direct operating costs savings. So, why not go and utilize existing 2000 foot runways and avoid these kinds of safety issues that we just talked about and go serve those missions and there's plenty of those. What is the benefit of having the capability to land on a 300 foot field? And, what does that translate directly to market opportunities?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We've looked at this, it's a great question, and we've looked at this, in sort of, I'll broaden the question to how you use blown lift, and, the NASA X 57 and the Electra eSTOL set out to use blown lift in two different ways, right? Essentially what the physics of the blown lift do is make the wing look aerodynamically like it's larger than it physically is, and we use that to have a large wing which gives slow speeds and therefore short takeoff and landing, and the X 57 was focusing it more on CTOL mode and have efficiencies in cruise. And I think that, where you set that knob depends on the mission that you're trying to do. beat\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'd be really curious to understand, a customer of yours that's in the logistics space, that's in the Caravan space, for instance today, how do they think of the added benefit of, this kind of short field takeoff and landing capabilities, and whether they would be eager to go through the, trouble of setting up a private field and creating, presumably this needs to be an available service, and so you need to be able to go in and out in all weather conditions including IFR, and so that means developing procedures for those airfields. So why not just go to a nearest 2000, foot runway, wherever your current operations exist and utilize an aircraft that is much cheaper and easier to operate?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>48:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Couple of, couple answers to that. The first is that in our analysis, it's not a lot cheaper than, the actual cost for being able to do, both what we would call a very short field urban air mobility mission. Short field, the helicopter, analogy mission, versus the the, sort of Caravan mission on that. And our analysis is that we can do both, but the kinds of things we're looking at, the time savings, I go back to the time savings comes from getting in close from starting and, ending your journey, close to the customer's point of origin and point of destination and, yes, there's an argument that, oh, there's lots of underutilized airports in the U. S. Yeah, and most of them are places people don't want to go. Okay, that's why they're underutilized. Their warehouse is not on an airportand there's 4000 warehouses in the Amazon network alone and the Walmart network alone and you've got 10 or 12 of those players in the US economy and so you have tens of thousands of these middle mile logistics places you'd like to go your you're not going to build conventional airports at all of those. Are you going to be able to take a piece of the existing parking lot and, stripe it off and fence it off and operate aircraft out of there? We think the answer to that question is yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, that's actually one of my questions is, if you have a customer that has these types of facilities and maybe they're, well located next to a highway network, but they want to bring an air capability into those locations and they have the lot or they have open space, walk us through what it would take for them to, be able to fly in and out of there. Do they have to go and deal with zoning county ordinances? Does it happen at the state level? I think a lot of us in the audience know what the fAA has to say about this, paint that picture for types of customers. how easy or hard that going to be for to do?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. Well, yeah, well, and you had Dave Stepanek on, from Bristow, and Dave talked about a lot of this in his interview. What Bristow is looking at is not necessarily flying an E STOL airplane onto an existing oil and gas platform. That's probably going to stay as a helicopter mission, although Electra also says, well, here's how much a barge costs, and a barge that you can operate our airplanes off of is, is actually not an expensive proposition, but be that as may, Bristow's current market, is to expand into exactly that, or in current vision, I, and I not putting words in Dave Stepanek's mouth, he said this on his podcast with you, is exactly to expand into some of these middle mile kinds of things. And who better than helicopter operators to address those questions that you're talking about? We do not have the answer to every question that you answered in there, but you can do all of these missions today with helicopters. It's just not, economically feasible and with the noise, we think not very, sustainable in that. But, you could do air service with helicopters into these distribution points but we think for the middle mile, you need to do a couple of thousand pounds and, we think the economics begin to really work on this size airplane more than some of the smaller UAVs. What's the interesting really going to be to routine drone deliveries in residential areas? We're hoping it's where everybody goes, oh, they notice it the first few times you Do it and then it goes to a background effect.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One question that I wanted to ask was, what extent, John you considered general aviation an an interesting use case. You mentioned, the three up front, but I haven't heard GA that to me is, a really interesting market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, GA is, it goes back to a lot of your autonomy guests that you've had on and discussions. At Aurora, we had a program called Centaur, and Aurora still has that going, which is, a DA 42 that was modified to be an optionally piloted airplane, where there was a human in the left seat and a robot in the right seat, and we did it in a way that it didn't void the normal category certification of the airplane when you put the robot in, and we spent a lot of time making the robot removable and in a way that didn't void the normal category cert, so you could fly it manned in a normal category, you could fly it, robotically in a, in an experimental category then, and we demonstrated that. I personally flew on one of those. And it's pretty weird sitting behind the robot while the robot flies it. There was a safety pilot, of course, on the airplane, but all they did was avoid other traffic right. That was the, their role on that was the detect, see and avoid. And so, I always thought that the real role for autonomy in the US airspace system is really in the revitalization of general aviation. I, I think that's where it's going to ultimately make a huge difference, because if you look at it for the last 50 years, it's been a steady decline of the number of rated pilots, Learning to fly safely in the United States is a little bit of stick and rudder and a lot of procedures. Where a lot of the costs, the proficiency and the, I'll just call it the hassle, comes from. And that's the place that I think autonomy can help the most. So I'm a big believer on general aviation. When I was at Aurora, we were looking at, what it took to get an STC on the automation package and when you talked to Rob Rose a lot of his comments are very familiar, because we looked at all of that and worked on all of that at Aurora, with the goal of getting to a general aviation airplane that you could fly with the kind of, training and proficiency that goes into a driver's license and not what you currently have to have for\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You brought up Aurora, Tell us some highlights from Aurora that you think apply to Advanced Air Mobility that you think our audience be interested to hear about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the first comment I would make about Aurora is that it started out to be an environmental company That the mission of Aurora Flight Sciences, when we started in 1989, was to do robotic airplanes for global climate change research. And for our first decade, that was pretty much our exclusive focus of trying to build new tools for atmospheric scientists to probe the stratosphere. And that turned out to be challenging, primarily in terms of the financial support that is out there for climate research. People seem to have lots of opinions on the climate and it's proven to be remarkably difficult to build a company around, um, the, environmental research tools and the exploration of the stratosphere. Aurora pivoted, about, 8 to 10 years into its history to being what I would call more conventional UAV markets, meaning that we got into the defense sector, prior to 9 11. And the program that I think really made Aurora, which a lot of people probably don't fully appreciate, was Global Hawk. We bid that as a program to DARPA, or DARO, back in 1994. And the only requirement that they put out was a 10 million unit flyaway price. That was the firm requirement. We took that seriously, and we bid that, and we told them, here's what we think you can do for a 10 million UFP. Bob Mitchell, who is one of the absolute, both aeronautical and management geniuses of our business, who was the president of Teledyne Ryan at the time, built the airplane the Air Force actually wanted. And, of course, they won that., Aurora pivoted quickly and got onto that team as building composite parts, for Bob and his team on the Tier 2 Plus. And then it went from Tier 2 Plus to Global Hawk, from DARPA to the Air Force, from Teledyne Ryan became Northrop then 911 happened and all of a sudden, Global Hawk was a very large program About two weeks before the 911 attacks Aurora put in a bid to Northrop at the time, to build all of the composite parts except the wing, on Global Hawk, and we had won it. And all of a sudden, that was just a huge program. It was very painful, a lot of learning and rapid growth into that, but that was the program that really made Aurora transition from being a, a small, shop that had been pursuing the environmental market into the serious player it became in the aerospace market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And John, how has Boeing benefited from the acquisition of Aurora? What was the rationale behind that? Some would say that one of the reasons that this transaction happened was because Boeing wanted to kill the D8 Double Bubble who compete with the 737. What do you think about that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I, I'm a huge admirer of Dennis Mullenberg, and Dennis did a great interview again on your show, and I think in that interview a lot of Dennis's vision and enthusiasm really came through very clearly in that. And we were part of that. Dennis was out to transform Boeing. He realized that just because you're the best in the game today doesn't mean you will be in 50 years. And our job was part of that portfolio, was to be a disruptive innovation force at Boeing that was looking at generations of airplanes in the future. And, and Dennis, I just think is a terrific, visionary. He was the driver behind the Aurora acquisition. And so Aurora's role was to become an autonomy center, a prototyping center. Boeing had a lot of aspirations. Boeing did not and still does not have a Part 23 division, a division that can do Part 23 airplanes. At various times they've said that's not a market we want to be into, but other times they have been interested in it, so there were a lot of pieces that combined into there. Absolutely true that the D8 was the thing that got that round of the discussions that it led to the acquisition did start with teaming discussions on this NASA, Advanced Concept Demonstrator back in 2016 or so, came out of the NPLUS 3 program and the D8 was a program that had been led by MIT and that Aurora had worked on and was very interested in. But that was, that was a piece of the discussion. Aurora and Boeing had a number of previous programs for a number of different customers, several of them in high altitude, long endurance things where we were both competitors, but also we were, suppliers to them on, on high altitude programs, what the world came to see as Phantom Eye. There were programs before Phantom Eye, but The, Phantom Eye was the one that that became publicly announced and flew. And, you know, Aurora did the wing on Phantom Eye. We did all the engine testing. This was back in 2007/2008. So there was a pretty long history of collaboration working for and with Boeing before the discussions that were kicked off in 2016, that were in fact centered initially around the D8, but broadly they were centered around Dennis's vision of how you built a great aerospace company for the 22nd century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How do think that plan is shaping up?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I don't think it's any secret that Boeing has had some tough times, the Max and COVID were a double whammy. that, that hit them and all the big players particularly hard. I'm impressed. I think Aurora's doing well under Boeing. And I was really pleased at the AIAA SciTech, just a couple of weeks ago here that the DARPA TTO director on stage, publicly commented on how well he thought the Aurora Boeing merger and integration was goIng. Usually we see, big companies buy the little companies and then smother them with bigness. that's in he said, I don't see that happening at Aurora. I see Aurora doing really well and keeping their small company mojo while still doing a good job of reaching deep into the Boeing system for talent and resources. And, I think when your customers are saying that, that's what you want, right? You want it, you're, we're all in business, for our customers. and, I was really pleased to hear that. So I think that's a great testimonial for everybody who's worked hard to make that integration\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the comments you made earlier I'd like to get your further thoughts on. Aurora being great in research and development, but never really building more than one of anything and then to see you move into Electra starting a company that really is very much product focused. What are some of the insights in terms of commercializing technologies that you have learned along the way at Aurora that you internalized as you started to build out Electra.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the company culture is something that is, very difficult to change in, any entity even in small organizations, particularly in large organizations, it's hard to change the culture once it's, locked in. And, you get really good at doing one thing, and you know, Clay Christensen said that your, disabilities are a byproduct of your strengths, right? that what you're good at also defines what, you're not good at. Cause you have all these systems and processes in Aurora's case that are set up to do new things quickly but not to do the same thing, over and not to, support products in the field if from Something at Aurora, I you know I always kind of regretted that. I mean to make a real impact you have to not just invent new things, you have to fuse them into the world where people can use them to make a real impact. And that's what I wanted to do with, Electra. So Electra is not at all competitive with Aurora in terms of company mission.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John. you've had a lot disciples from Aurora who are in Advanced Air Mobility. Who's doing the most interesting work?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the things I am most proud of, from the Aurora experience is what I call the Aurora Diaspora, of people who came to Aurora right out of school, for whom Aurora was their first job, and I I was their first boss, who have gone on to be CEOs or founders of companies. It, the list is like 15 or so. It's amazing. And a number of them have been on your show. So, Brian Yutko, one of the true stars of his generation you who was, what or one of the most rapidly advanced people in the history of Aurora, ran the R&amp; D center in Cambridge, and then was the, head of all the product development. He's now the CEO at Wisk, but Paul Eremenko hired him out the aero department. His first job was on the goldenEye at, at Aurora. He's, had a incredible career at Google and Airbus and, now Universal Hydrogen and, Billy Thalheimer, at Regent, Adam Woodworth, who, was our go to guy for small UAVs at Aurora, until, Google lured him to the West Coast, and now he's the CEO at Wing. it goes on. one of the, one of the bigger ones was Insitu.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let me ask you a quick question. John, if we had Brian and Billy in room right now and you closed the door and said, okay, guys, here are the things you're doing really well and here are a couple of, things you should take a look at. What would be one two things they're doing really well? What are one or two pieces of advice give to Brian and Billy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I wouldn't try to give them advice. I would ask them for advice. I would say, you tell\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good answer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>uh, Part of being successful is having good ties and loyalty in all directions, right? It's not about burning people down, to build a successful company. It's about, helping everybody reach their full potential. And, we always said that the, you hire on talent. And then you find a role for people in the, business. And I think the string of people who have gone on to start their own businesses or become CEOs of either their own business or a business that somebody else helped start, is something that I'm very proud of and that speaks well to that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Such a universal truth. And, now you're embarking on a similar journey with Electra. When you look that journey, how do see the capital requirements for bringing Electra Aero's first product to market and, into reasonable scale production? How is this going to compare to what an eVTOL project? We all have good examples and familiarity with what those cost. How much capital have you raised so for Electra?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, one thing my mother taught me, you never talk about money in public so I'm not going to give you a straight answer on that question. I will say the total we're looking is based on things like what Pilatus spent to bring the PC 24 into certification. And, Pilatus is one of my favorite companies. I, I think they are just a fantastic example. And, their airplanes are wonderful. And they did the PC 24 for somewhere around 400 million or something like that. And I think that is a reasonable number to bring something in this class range into, certification. That's a 20 percent of what some of these other guys are spending on on this and frankly, I don't know how they have 700 people.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, to get the certification, if you can do it for about 400, I'd say that's, 25 percent of the cost of what these other players are going to take. Maybe 20%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we've lot questions John. Is there else that we haven't talked about you'd like to discuss?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I wanted to just touch on the STEM and, diversity and inclusion element of, industry, which is one of the things that, I am really, passionate about. We touched on it a little bit in that, how you grow leaders and how you help people develop to their potential. But, that starts really young, and I am a huge believer in both the sort of workforce development, which is the pragmatic way to look at STEM, and then the, the sort of, it's the right thing to do, sort of morality angle of STEM, and, I think that is just so the important and foundational to everything all of us in this industry are doing. I grew up in the sixties when Apollo was on the evening news every night, it was the good news story of the 60s and it attracted a whole generation of people into the workforce. Today, we don't have that as much from and we can't take for granted as an industry that people are going to want to just flock to what we're doing. I think we're all made up of total aviation people and, true believers, but we can't just depend on that cadre of folks. We have to be, evangelists in this for, our profession. And, that's part of why I've been very passionate about, programs like FIRST Robotics or like the Team America Rocketry Challenge and why our family has gotten involved with Estes Industries because I see the hobbies like model rocketry as being incredible, STEM development and workforce development, tools.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:09:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Five, ten years from now, how is world different than most people are expressing it? You've heard sounds like just about all of our podcasts, and you're hearing them pontificate on what's going to happen in the next 5 10 years in this world of advanced air mobility. How was your than what you're hearing of our guests?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first, I will caveat that, the reality is I have no idea, right, because, it's really tough to have a crystal ball like that. I tend to think, though, that being a big student of history, that, I look at the VLJ market, I look at the commercial drone market, I lived through the hype and excitement, that surrounded both of those, and if you look at those, you think, well, there'll be few players that emerge in a dominant position there'll be a handful of zombies and there'll be an awful lot of roadkill. I think the big outstanding question for me is whether the eVTOLs are going to end up being the aeronautical version of the Segway. And there was a great article in Wired magazine a few years ago that was titled, well, that didn't work. The Segway is a technological marvel. Too bad it doesn't make any sense. And it, goes back and dissects the, I'll call it the rise and fall of the Segway, which was, an amazing invention by an amazing person. Dean Kamen is truly remarkable. And what he's done in his career, and particularly with FIRST Robotics, I think is nothing short of amazing, but the Segway, was, we weren't going to be walking anymore because we were all going to be on Segways. And, that's not how it played out. So I push those as cautionary tales. And, I guess that's my big question of whether, you're going to see a lot of the eVTOL stuff end up as aeronautical Segways.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What advice would give to our listeners are starting companies with all of your experience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Agree that it is a remarkable time for innovation and thus for entrepreneurship answer in aerospace I encourage and support that. My, advice would be not to get captivated by chasing unicorns. That the idea that it's how much money you raise, that's the goal, or the metric that's that wrong. I believe that the goal here is to build sustainable, viable businesses. That means they have to have customers and revenue and ultimately earnings. And, I think that's what you've really got to focus on when you build a business is, how am I going to get to, revenues and earnings and not, just, some kind of paper valuation. That is the encouragement I give students and people when they ask about it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This has been a great talk, John.

Of being able to, listen to, folks like Dennis Mullenberg or Bob Pierce, at the same time we're, talking to people like Brian and, some of your other guests.

Have you noticed that often our guests have just amazing backgrounds, which lead to responses with multiple layers of depth in and appreciation of aviation, how vehicles are built, use cases and the value to transportation, and society. Well, Dr. Manning is one of those people, and this is one of those discussions. So how do we summarize our talk? This is a discussion around the value of advanced air mobility of eVTOLs and Overair's unique value to meet these requirements. So we've had this discussion many times: on the value of the advanced air mobility and eVTOLs, but it changes over time and of course, based on the experience, education and the workplace of the person responding. And so as such, this is a conversation with Valerie that's really worth listening to. In preparing for the podcast I was really intrigued with Overair and solid technical foundation. We really don't get into great detail on Overair and although Valerie does provide some perspective on what they've done, what they're doing and what they plan to build, I would encourage you to learn more about the company. They have a foundation of aviation competence that not everyone shares as they build their new aircraft in this new space. We discussed the state of advanced air mobility market today compared to several years ago, the most notable milestones, what's not getting enough attention and the road to commercialization. We then discuss what has changed about the viability and the use case of eVTOLS in the last several years, both positive and otherwise. We spend a bit of time discussing whether or not there's a real first mover advantage in advanced air mobility, comparing Boeing's potential advantage in the early days of aviation and perhaps where Overair may have a slow mover advantage as their vehicle will learn from the experiences and the learning curve of the initial launch vehicles and early stage eVTOL markets. For a lot of reasons Overair could be in a really strong position. We then discussed Valerie's work as Chief Commercial Officer, what the role entails a bit about their go to market strategy, and a more detailed discussion around the trade-off between selling aircraft and operating transportation networks. The jury's still out on the size of the eVTOL and advanced or mobility market, we've learned a lot, even in the last two years we've been having these podcast discussions. But it's hard to argue that leaders like Dr. Valerie Manning and companies like Overair with their thoughtful and careful approach are more likely to be one of the winners. Valerie, thanks for joining us and to our listeners, enjoy our talk with Dr. Valerie Manning as you in 2024 innovate in The Vertical Space.

I'm a big fan of the podcast,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first question we usually ask, one thing that very few in the industry agree with you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh yeah, I expected this one. And, I think I'll make this a little personal, but then tie this back, I think to, to our industry sector, which is, I. I am a pilot, but I did all of my initial training from zero all the way up to the ATPL flight instruction and everything in Europe, in France. Now I'm back in the U. S. and I'm flying here and everybody around the general aviation industry is like, wow, it's so hard and so expensive to fly in Europe. That's what we hear and it must be so much better in the U. S. And I'm like, I don't know what you're talking about, right? It's, at least in, in France, yeah, you can just go to the airfield six kilometers from my house, hop in the aircraft, fly to any of 10 or so close by airports, towered, untowered, class golf to delta, grass paved, any instrument approach you could want, and then land and go home, right? And it's similar here, except there's none of this, like, fearful bravo in France, so maybe that's what makes it easier here. But, no, to be fair, yeah, some airports do charge a lot, we don't have the FBO system, so it's just different. But I do love flying here in the U. S. as well. I think I've flown to 20 countries and, 90 or so airfields across Europe, and it's great fun and quite welcoming, so I just want to put that out there. But, bringing it back to eVTOL, there is an eVTOL angle which relates to the corridors and segregation. I think that's a longer point, and this is an area where, I don't know if there's so much disagreement, but we need to come to some kind of accord as to how are we going to proliferate, eVTOL around the world, given that it's so different in every country, how they're accustomed to relatively low and relatively slow aircraft\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, what would the industry consensus be on that topic, and what's your diverging viewpoint.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I would say that, I don't know that there's consensus, but I think at least here in the U. S. and for much of Europe, which are the two areas I know, is that we just, don't need to start in the near term with the aim of trying to define particular corridors and particular segregation at the beginning, because the ramp up is not going to be from zero to a hundred, where suddenly there's, hundreds of aircraft or thousands of aircraft flying around overhead. At the rate that I believe I see in many places, the uptake being, I think that we can fit in as the GA rules are working today, and then over time we can see, yes, what communication aspects might need to be adopted. What, perhaps, in some areas, what corridors might be adopted. So, I just think that's something we shouldn't constrain ourselves from the beginning, but to see how behavior, adapts, and adapt along with it. It's something that will need to come, but technology is evolving, I think some of our customs are evolving, the airspace itself is evolving, and I think we should evolve along with it and not constrain ourselves right from the beginning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's do a bit of a recap of the eVTOL market going back, maybe three, five years, however many years in the past you want to go. And, highlight some of the key milestones, big wins, persistent strong headwinds, the change in stakeholder sentiment or any key things that you observed over the last five years in the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, in this industry sector anyway, five years is a long time. I have a long career in, in, let's say more traditional big aviation. and so until, just over a year ago I was observing, this industry. So, of course, we had a period in, in traditional aviation during COVID where there was just an extreme amount of uncertainty. And one thing that, that I found, the whole question was, when is it coming back? How is it coming back? but I think in, and it largely has, there are some things that are lagging, but largely has. And our industry is extremely resilient. So one thing that I've seen change, and I think for the better, is that across aviation and aerospace, the fact that we have these emerging sectors that are actually making things very exciting between, the hydrogen, eVTOL, we have new space, commercial space, and the innovation that's enabled by new technologies and, yes, by some forcing functions such as, ESG focus, etc. I think is very exciting because we can use this to attract new talent into the industry, maybe to compete with some other industries for talent, and just to get some passion back into aerospace. I'm an aerospace engineer, Air Force veteran, aviation is really my life, and I would love to get another generation of players that feel the same way about it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what do you remember as key moments for this particular sector of the industry over the last several years?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, as an observer, when I was starting to think about coming into this sector of Advanced Air Mobility or eVTOL, I had some friends who had moved into it, was talking to them. Something that really sticks out to me is, the financial moves, in 2021 with the SPAC boom, et cetera, and the amount of money that was going into it. And I know this was happening in some other industries as well. But just to see, wow, all of a sudden an influx of money, and also to see that, it, to some, and I think in some cases it's for better and for worse, for some this wasn't so much an aviation play as a transportation play, right? So you're attracting different money, different players, which maybe gets things, at least at that time, moving at a different pace. But that really was a point to me in 21 saying, wow, this is really a shift that we hadn't seen before.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Valerie based on the SPAC years of a couple of years ago what do you think has most changed as relates to the perception of the value of advanced air mobility, eVTOLs?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I really think that, the sort of sobering reality has hit on the part of AAM that is aviation, is that, hitting the face of realities of regulation, hitting the face of realities of, of the supply chain, meaning how do we set up and certify every aspect of the aircraft. Realizing that this is a relatively long term play. I think for traditional aviation, eVTOL AAM is moving at an extremely rapid pace, but for things like, more digital industries, it's moving at a slow pace, right, which means that maybe that return on investment isn't quite, that business case isn't quite exactly what people expected. So, I think though that kind of slowing down a little bit relative to perhaps what some people thought at the beginning is a good thing, but still it's a forcing function for traditional aviation, I think, hey, how can we do things differently? So, that's why I think these kind of, colliding cultures have come to hopefully create something great, going forward now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Valerie, do you think there are any lessons that we can learn from the culture that SpaceX created and how they straddled, the velocity of technology development with the, necessities of working, in a regulated space and working on complex systems that have to come together at launch and ultimately, reach, levels of safety thresholds. We've been, been grappling in advanced air mobility with this intersection of two cultures. Any insights that, that you see from that in terms of what is the right mix and what wins?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's really no one answer to that. I will just say, if you think about SpaceX, and some others, well, not too many others, really, I would say, is this idea of we know where we want to go. We know that we have to achieve a certain level of, yes, safety, regulation, et cetera, and we put those boundaries in place. Other than that, everything's on the table, meaning new ways of thinking, and really, I imagine, not going back to, well, it hasn't been done before, right? This is something where, and since you do have a mix of cultures, of, let's say aviation or aerospace traditionalists, and then, new entrants, is not to say always compare yourself to, how long things have taken in the past, how hard things were in the past, and to move into, how, like, a problem solving. What's the opportunity here? So, it's really a delicate balance, I would say, and here I'm just talking about, not even talking about operations, but just about, getting the aircraft flying, getting the aircraft certified. And it's not only about the OEMs and the operators, right? The regulators are understandably struggling with this as well. Because there are so many new technologies, new configurations, everything to play at once. But, it's so much about, about mindset, and I don't think there's one right answer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So on the theme of the sobering reality that you mentioned before, where do you see the biggest buckets of risk as it relates to bringing eVTOLs to market? Is it in the certification of the various technologies involved, is it in the maturation of the supply chain, the operations themselves, or just the uncertainty on the demand where do you see the biggest risk and how do you prioritize the organization around those?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, well you certainly hit on several of them. some are technical risk, some are business risk. there are several categories of risks and, I think on any given day, one or another seems to stand at the forefront, but I think, fundamentally, we're trying to create business here and create business value, within the regulatory environment, within, the safety constraints that we all know and love. And, one of the reasons I chose Overair is because I thought, really, there were the fundamentals, including technical fundamentals, to create that real long-term business value. And it does come down to having a vehicle that's fit for purpose. I see these vehicles, these, VTOL vehicles as basically, it's a utility, right? We're creating a utility. How can we safely and effectively move people and goods to create business value along the value chain? And we talk about, for example, regulatory risk and how do we certify. Well, there are some that are moving quickly or trying to move quickly and pave that path. How do we get through regulation? Those aren't all necessarily the configurations that can go faster not always necessarily the configurations that will create long term business value. And as an aviation business person, that fundamental ability to create, business value along the value chain is what attracts me quite a lot. So it'll be interesting to see who has that patience of waiting for Wave 2 or even Wave 1. 5 to, to get to that value. But even so, I think another one of the risks in creating business value is how narrow or wide do you see, the use cases, the ability to address markets, right? That's another thing with the, the combination of the size that we can have with the Overair Butterfly, being able to have a tiltrotor. We have this utility in mind, being able to address a broad range of use cases with one vehicle, whether you're moving people in terms of VIP or passenger commuting, whether you're moving, volume constrained cargo, whether it's medical transport, I think this versatility is something that can help, address and mitigate the risks. I think another risk that has come up, of course, is around things like the ecosystem, the infrastructure that's there. Here, this one, I personally worry about less, especially if you have a range of use cases because in many parts of the world, there's so much underutilized, infrastructure that we can start with, that as we finalize, really getting that community acceptance, point going so that Vertiports can go in certain urban areas, which I'll get to in a moment. I think that really, we can utilize the infrastructure that exists. And then, I think a risk that is a huge one for me towards business value creation is about adoption related to noise, right? It's now you come back to what's the holy grail of scaling in the future? It is that sort of commuter or that sort of end to end cargo or being able to get into urban areas. That's going to matter. And here communities are not always going to be very accepting. So we want to make sure that the perception of noise, pushing noise regulations, that is something that's very key, and that's something that we're designing the Overair Butterfly around, is really that noise footprint.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned, the first wave and the second wave of airframers. What's it like being an airframer in each of those waves of vehicles that are coming to market? Who do you think is in the first wave? Who's in the second? What are the pros and cons of being in each?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I mean we know who are the ones who are really trying to, fly first or certify first in 24/25. I think some of the pros there are, if you're fast moving, and especially if you're in a situation where you have, shareholder needs to meet, if you're a public company, then you have some shareholder needs to meet that are more near term, and that makes a lot of sense. It also gives some level, potentially, of first mover advantage if the configuration is something that can support value creation again. And I think that's an advantage for those companies, but it's also a bit of an advantage for the rest of us so that we can see, how will we need to navigate the regulatory environment, the business environment, and maybe some market first mover advantage, but there are so many markets around the world, to address that I don't think there's too much danger in being squeezed out and not being able to find a market niche. I think, one of the advantages of coming just after, as I said, is yes, taking advantage of the regulators being a bit more savvy in what they want to do. And also just simply taking the time to develop some of the technologies that might take a little longer, right? Overair started, I would say, a little bit later, and of course we're adapting fabulous technology that has been developed over decades, in the past, and now, electrifying it and applying it to the civil market. That is going to be an advantage, I believe, because we're going to have that time to develop a vehicle that is, as I said before, it's one vehicle that can serve several missions with minimal adaptation, minimal configuration change in terms of the vehicle itself. Everything can happen in the cabin. I think also the way I see it is it's, again, what we address here in building the business at Overair, it's a lot more than the vehicle itself. There's a lot that goes on, around a vehicle, whether it's, traditional aviation or eVTOL, that's necessary, right? There is the, there's the training, there's the maintenance, there's the software, there's the, as we said, infrastructure, the concept of operations that will take time to adapt. So we're taking advantage of that. I think by the time we come to service and we are focused on that kind of 2028 timeframe we'll be able to come, I think, with a little bit more of a holistic, I, arguably a more holistic offering.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>19:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, thanks, Valerie. Hey, a question for you, based on what you just said as the Chief Commercial Officer is your greater challenge, defining the use cases of advanced air mobility. Or is it the defining Overair's and Butterfly's role are placed in advanced air mobility. You're really doing two things aren't you, as you come from big aviation, you are first trying to decide what's the real value of these things. And you're creating that value amongst the other players in the space. So is that the bigger challenge? Or is the bigger challenge, defining Overair's place in that world.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's an excellent way of putting it. I mean, it's funny, Ben Tigner, the CEO and when I was coming, we were like, What should we call my role, right? Chief Commercial Officer, because I think, I have, probably the broadest, definition of Chief Commercial Officer that I've ever seen in the industry, I think, which of course comes down to, getting our product out to market, but it's also defining what are those markets, it's defining what are the use cases, the concept of operation, the performance needs of the vehicle, the industrial design aspect of the vehicle, of course, all the software that's related and, the training and services, et cetera. So it is a mix of what you're saying there. in a way, yeah. the adage of, is eVTOL a hammer looking for a nail? the nails are there. what I'm trying to do, because of the fact that the vehicle that the company had already started to create before I got here lent itself to being quiet, fast, as only really, fundamentally, tiltrotors can be, relatively large and high volume, I just saw like, wow, okay, this can do a lot of things. So then it's, yeah, it's a little bit doing both. Figuring out how we fit in, but we can fit in most places, I would say. it's really thinking about where do we go and at what stage do we address which market. Because I think that the use cases will evolve at different pace, at different rates, right? This sort of, as I said before, like Holy Grail of people commuting to and from work or going to the ball game or the ride sharing. That's where huge volume can come, but that's coming later. Right, what's coming earlier? Things that are a bit more either scheduled, or some helicopter replacement, or some specific known use cases, like a cargo, a medical transport. This is what comes earlier, and I think not necessarily every vehicle is suited for that. Yes, of course we have airport shuttle, which is quite logical because you have established infrastructure already on one side, so that's very helpful for everybody. So I think it's really a mix of both. Now with that comes as well, geography, like where are we going, and I think part of value creation today is making sure that communities and locales, be it urban, rural, that they understand how to take advantage of these vehicles. So creating markets, that's for example what we are, trying to do in working with the Dallas Fort Worth, airport, with the city of Arlington, with that whole region there. Because this is a region that's like, we want this. How can we use this? But we're not sure exactly what to do. So we're not just in there saying, here, take our vehicle. We're in there sitting with them and saying, okay, this is how, the VertiPort could work. This is what we think we need. This is the technological development. This is the workforce development that's needed. Right? Everything that goes around it as well. So, you laid out two aspects, the kind of the give and take, and yes, indeed, I think that's equally challenging, the give and the take that, that I'm trying to, to develop at Overair.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So being in the first wave of vehicle developers coming to market, it definitely resonates with me that you build a vehicle that is versatile and multi purpose, as to the mission that you fly, because we have a lot to learn from actually flying these vehicles. And I think it's a safe assumption that the second wave of vehicle manufacturers are going to be designing some of those learnings into their vehicles. So, in this first wave, I have to ask the question, how likely is it that the first generation of vehicles are going to be in the market long enough that they scale up to mass production? Or will it be second generation revisions of those vehicles that are ultimately the ones that scale up? Likewise, the first generation companies are doing a lot of internal development of propulsion systems and of other subsystems integrated into the vehicle. They have to verticalize right now because of the state of the supply chain. So, do you go after missions that require large volumes of vehicle production in order to really make the mission work for that end market with the first generation vehicles? Or do you focus on, missions that, might operate at higher, unit economics, but in, in lower volume, and then prepare the supply chain and, participate alongside the second wave of vehicle manufacturers for going into these higher volume applications? I'm really trying to think how would you, navigate this set of questions because you're working across a few different dimensions of consideration,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>25:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, no, I know exactly what you mean and it's so fascinating and again, being somebody who's now a year and a couple of months removed from big aviation, traditional aviation, these are fantastic problems that we do face, like this is operational strategy, right? You think about it, you try to understand what makes the most business value, what's the most logical sense, and then you do it. And that's just, it's so refreshing and nice to be, in this industry space. But look, there's a few things to unpack there. One was about, the different missions, and do you go for volume, or do you go for something that's maybe more niche, but some way to prove out what it is that you're trying to do and another gets into the supply chain. I would say, in terms of the volume aspect, that's an excellent one. One of the main reasons to go for volume is production cost, right? It's just bringing cost down. We all see that there is a huge market, if you think about how, just globally, what could these vehicles be used for, if you have the right vehicle. Whether you're talking military, civil, or any of those use cases I mentioned before, worldwide. There's just, there's room for a lot of vehicles. So, obviously the more you can address these different needs, the more you can produce, the more your costs come down, if you don't have to, as you mentioned, if you don't have to continually redesign. Of course there will be adaptation over time, on the airframe side. So, for one instance, of course we do want to go for scale. But that scale will come I'm not going to say slowly, but I don't think the ramp up, if you talk to the composite manufacturers for example, the ramp up may come at a moderate enough pace that if you find the right, let's say, moderate use cases, you can, I think, be more supply constrained at the beginning, than, than demand constrained, I think. So, that's why for us, some of these as you mentioned, higher unit economics, when we talk about a little bit of helicopter replacement, not completely, but when you look at how helicopters are used today, there is a niche, and helicopter operators today are telling us there are some things they would love to use this for. They're very specific about what they want on their routes, but and then they ask, can the aircraft meet it? And when you talk about these unit economics, by the way, this is something myself and Gonzalo Ramos, who I hired, who also, came from, my alma mater, I would say. we really understand that and get really into how can our vehicles not just say, hey, we can fly a hundred miles and go somewhere, but specific routes, specific cases, what can we do? It's a lot of work, but you sell to the customer on that basis. And it's, so yeah, it might be smaller fleets, maybe more lucrative routes to start out with, but very good for route proving over time. And that's something that, the Butterfly is, we believe is very versatile in that sense. Others may have, maybe with their vehicle, maybe a smaller scope of what they can do, but maybe for one particular thing they do it very well, so I can't really speak for others. And again, the masses, that really comes with behavior change. People that are ready to commute around in these vehicles, making sure we have vertiports in spaces. That, that comes a little bit later, I believe. With regards to the supply chain, what I found is, one of the fascinating things is, the, in full supply chain in this industry sector, what's refreshing and nice is, a lot of it is, are the same suppliers, right? When you talk, structures, when you talk avionics, if you're talking about training, MRO, etc. These are people I've known for a long time, and it's been quite, nice to talk to them about, this new industry sector. And for them, there are challenges. Sometimes it's plug and play, sometimes it's, well, we know you need XYZ component, but we have to think about if it makes sense for us to make it lighter, cheaper, etc. The dynamic that's different on the supply chain is that instead of, these suppliers saying, whoa, we want to be on one of or both of companies in a duopoly, let's say, they're having to sit and decide, who am I going to work with? Because there's still only so many suppliers, and now there's lots and lots of eVTOL players that want to have their products. So they have to figure out which few are we going to work with? And I'm proud to say that Overair seems to be, very attractive in that regard. So, we'll see on the supply chain economics, how that works out. But where it's really different are, as you mentioned, the motors and the batteries. this is really new, really different. And so there is a lot of, let's say, relatively large amount of, I would say, vertical integration or at least, internal development and design. And we all need things slightly different in terms of our batteries, peak power, etc. And in terms of the motor, geared, gearless, size, number. This is really diverse and I think there's extra investment going into this and it's hard to say how that's going to play out. You've seen that some companies, have chosen, in the propulsion area, have chosen to exit the space they were in, and now they're coming out of the space. Maybe they don't see the economics. So, I think that is one of those risks that we were talking about earlier, that we have to see, where does this new, bespoke supply chain, how does that shake out?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, or maybe they don't yet see the volume potential in the space to justify their continued investment in this part of the supply chain. But what do you think needs to transpire in the supply chain to change the equation for a new airframer? Say you have a new airframer that's planning to enter this market. What needs to transpire in the supply chain for them to credibly be able to decide on a strategy that doesn't involve them having to verticalize on energy or on propulsion or on some of the other key things that the current first generation of players are placing so much effort into.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, in a, traditionally one might say convergence of designs, right? I'm not going to say it needs a transpire, but that is one big difference, is, not to say in, in traditional aviation everything is the same, clearly it's not, but you have some understanding of what needs are, what designs are, so, for the major component suppliers being, whether it be engines or avionics or anything else, the needs, the requirements are largely understood, and then you tailor it. For eVTOL, you look at all the designs, they are wildly different, and so some idea of fundamental, like convergence of fundamentals, I think would be helpful for the supply chain, not necessarily for the OEMs, but for the supply chain to be able to see that they can have volume. for propulsion players that are exiting, I know that they, and rightfully so, they were thinking can we do a one size fits all motor, or at least design of a motor, that then we can tailor for each, and it just didn't work out, right? So, I think there's some convergence there. Now, fundamentally I believe, truly believe, that the long term, vehicle that will get the most utilization, that will serve the most markets, that will be the quietest, that will be the fastest, is the tiltrotor. There is an aircraft that basically always has all of its propulsion working for it, as opposed to carrying around some propulsion that's not working for it in any given phase of flight. Right now there are two tiltrotors out there. There may be others in the future. So, I think some convergence of configuration over time may work, but it doesn't mean that only tiltrotors can work. It's just, there's, if investment can be concentrated, then perhaps volumes go up and costs can come down. However, since there's so much of a market, and there's room for a lot of vehicles, in terms of number of vehicles, I think that there can be several different configurations, given the right markets, that can achieve economies of scale as well, if all works out well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And with the first generation of vehicles, I think It's safe to infer, well, number one, they've really covered some fundamental new ground in the flight capabilities, but it's safe to infer that, the vehicles, based on today's propulsion technology, today's battery technology, they're a bit heavier than we want, they're a bit more energy hungry than we wish. we're going to see improvements in that underlying technology going forward every year the next five years, but from your perspective, what are the strategies that make it easier versus harder for those first generation vehicles to gracefully incorporate these improvements, in the propulsion and the energy technology such that they can revise them, in a fairly lightweight, streamlined way, to be able to remain competitive in the market that's going to be with us in 2030 or the early 2030s.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's super hard to speak for all, certainly, but I just keep coming back to utility, right? If we talk about propulsion and energy, and those are two different things, I would say. So let me focus on energy management, for a minute. I don't know how deeply each of the other players is digging into increasing the utility of their vehicle by ensuring that the vehicle can fly everywhere it needs to go, right? Can manage hot and high conditions, can manage Cat A, right? To be able to, with a critical loss of thrust, still be able to have controlled flight to come back around and land, right? There are going to be some places where that's required. when we talk about, how to manage power based upon how long you can be on the wing, how quickly you can transition to vertical, right? These are things around the vehicle design that matter. That's where our, tilt rotor comes in. Think about military, for example. Overair happens to come from fundamental vertical lift technology that enhances efficiency of vertical lift with the optimum speed tilt rotor, the individual blade control work that was worked on by Abe Karem and Ben Tinger for years. And then they were like, wow, we have a technology that can be applied to this new industry, right? So, therefore, we are already thinking about energy management. Therefore, perhaps we can better manage the, let's say, limited somehow energy that's coming from batteries, right? You've got to really be able to adapt. And in some cases we say, okay, how are we going to manage critical loss of thrust? Are we going to really be able to do Cat A? How hot and how high can we fly? And I think this is where use case limitations, design limitations, and configuration changes are how different players are going to have to meet. Meanwhile, batteries will get better. But some things will never change. Well, never. I don't want to say that because who knows. But batteries don't lose weight, right? So, how do you manage your equally heavy vehicle, unless you've thrown something out of it, at a very critical time, very low charge of battery, high power need, vertical landing. How do you manage that? Well, that's going to be through configuration and CONOPS. Configuration of vehicle and CONOPS. So, those are just physics. So, I don't know how everyone's going to manage that. I know how Overair is working on that. And then the propulsion, again, I think these, motor designs, from what I've seen, and it is fascinating, electric motors, I had to learn a lot bone up again on the electric world over the past year. There are so many possibilities that I can't begin to say where there might be some convergence and how some may address. I think people are really just going to have to depend upon a good supply chain and scale to, to bring that down. I personally don't know, and I'm not the world's expert, but don't know that there's going to be a convergence on, on motor design in the near future between different, players.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I don't know if there will be on motor design. there are so many different vehicles to be built in different sizes that, we might see convergence in motor architecture. So, motors that are, lightweight, really good at managing their thermals and able to, deliver high torque at low RPM. I think those are common design objectives that we see at all scales, but, boy, one motor of one power spec and then seeing all the airframers design around it, that's, that still seems pretty far off to me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I agree. I agree. absolutely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To what extent is this a market where the first mover gains a long term advantage? And, perhaps we can take a page from traditional aviation where if you look at the jet airliner market, Boeing dominated it early on as an early pioneer. Whereas Airbus joined the race, what, 25 or so years later? And based on the current market dynamics, that didn't really hurt them. so argue both sides of that argument.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I'm biased, right? we all know my background, and I really appreciate all my time with Airbus, certainly. But, no, it's true that I think in this, there's a difference here. There may be eVTOL players that are, that don't exist yet, right? that will come in 10 years after everything's established, or established. That, it's known that this is an industry. This is a mode of transportation. They have a new, innovative idea. They do something slightly differently. Come in from the beginning without the baggage of having had to be part of starting up the industry. and they succeed by being more efficient at something that today, including Overair and others, aren't. Right, that can happen. And that's more, there's no way to argue against that because that's in the future. I think for today, first mover advantage, like I said, This, I think switching costs, it's a different entity than in eVTOL than in traditional aviation, right? And this comes back to why are so many eVTOL OEMs planning to operate the aircraft, right? Because there are no operators out there. I'm exaggerating a bit. you have some, you have some of the helicopter operators, et cetera, who are saying, we want to replace, like, just, like I already said earlier, yes, we want to fly from A to B, some of our routes could be replaced tomorrow by eVTOL, boom. That's great, because they know what they want, they know what they need, and as I said, you work on these unit economics, specifics for them, can they charge, can they not charge, infrastructure's already there, great. So, if you move that aside and you get to, let's say, passenger transport on, For the typical AAM, UAM you don't have these established operators that you have to make them switch. One thing in traditional aviation over the past, that's another thing that happened pre, it was pre COVID, but also post in some parts of the world. you have to just start up airlines, especially when money was cheap. You have airlines starting up and you're like, okay, a couple of people say, all right, we have some money. We want to get a couple of planes. They go to the lessors and then you can you can compete for their business, but as far as switching, we don't really have that right now. So, I think, and there's enough, space to go around, so I, It's a very different animal because the transportation, let's say, industry related to eVTOL the operator and the OEM growth is happening at the same time and you don't have national brands, you don't have mixed fleets, you don't have any of that yet. So that's where a lot of the uncertainty comes in. Also, the aircraft don't fly very far, right? If you have Let's say an Overair operation in Dallas, Fort Worth area, North Texas Please, I don't want to get in trouble by saying the wrong things. The Metroplex, right? If you have an Overair operation with Overair Butterfly aircraft today That is not competing with, you know somebody else's operation with somebody else's aircraft in Kansas City. It's just not competing, right? So, and you may be able to get enough scale to really work out your route proving, etc. Now, in the future, in North Texas, you may have somebody else's operation operating Overair Butterflies and operating, another eVTOL that's better suited for maybe tiny short routes with one or two passengers instead of a, let's say, a longer route with five passengers. And that's okay. You'll have a mixed fleet operator. So, it's really hard to say the dynamics and what's going to happen, but certainly if the vehicles are not cost effective and quiet um, I'm taking safety off of the equation for right now. I'm going to make that assumption of safety. That we're all trying to achieve the same goal. But if they're not cost effective and quiet, they will not last a long time, right? These are aircraft that are, single digit millions with, we're still working out, let's say, usable life, residual values, etc. But it's, I don't think it's going to be quite as challenging to switch. But it's going to be fascinating to see. To see this go.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Valerie help me out with this is Overair intending to be both the OEM and the operator when you go to market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's not our main objective to be an operator. however, we do need to start, to Just as in traditional aviation, the OEM needs to know its aircraft. It needs to know what the aircraft can do. It needs to know how to be efficient. so there will be some early on aspects of being the operator. And at the very least, being there with the operator, assisting the operator, as I said. we have some customers who are just doing helicopter replacement, but they don't exactly know, right? Part of my main job at Airbus, which I, I loved, was running customer support. Running this aspect of, though most of the company is ready to get the aircraft ready for the operator, my job was ready to get the operator ready for the aircraft. I say that a lot because it's so, so key. those, N minus X years, right? We're going to go into service in year X. Depending on the aircraft, depending on the experience of the operator, you're starting your, X minus one year, minus two years. In some cases, there was one customer who wanted to start five years in advance. And what are they doing? They're learning how to do it. They're training. They're getting their spares. You're sending teams of people on site when the aircraft gets there. Field service, engineers, supply chain people, digital people. And it's, especially for a startup airline, you're, I think it's well, it's underappreciated how much the OEM is involved, right? It's not my dream to sell tickets to people and, it's all going to be digital, but to, and people like, Oh, I'm late for my, where's my luggage? That's not my dream. but the OEM anyway is going to be a massive part of making sure that these aircraft operate. So ultimately, having, a part 135 for, for a certain element of time, makes sense. We're working a lot on the software aspect of this as well. Both on the pilot, the passenger side, the OCC, and the pilot. Because this is, I think it's also underappreciated how, in order to have an increased utilization of the aircraft, how much you have to really plan for ride sharing, and for how these aircraft are going to operate. It's something I underappreciated a year ago, so we have a great team working on that here. So, again, that all has to be proved out so that we can set it up for ourselves, and then in the future, where we really want to go. As into a model where we're helping others start up their operation with our aircraft, with our software, with our services. But, we have, we just have a couple of views, obviously we're located in Southern California, so doing some operations in Southern California makes sense. And then, I think it's, wouldn't be a surprise to anybody at this stage to see that North Texas is a target of ours to get some operations going there. And then, really, if that goes well, We're helping others operate and we're getting our vehicles out there on the market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you worry that, in some circumstances taking on the complexity of being the operator in addition to being the OEM is essentially a bridge too far for a startup.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know if worry is the right word. it's, and I don't think necessarily a bridge too far because if, however you develop the company. You can prepare, right? These companies are greenfield. You've got, think about it. I'm an aviation person. this company, Overair is based on an aerospace foundation, right? Defense, which is, also a good target market for us. But it's a foundation of understanding, the complexities of design. There are other eVTOLs out there. eVTOL companies, bless their hearts, that started from a Hey, we want to do this operation, and okay, let's build an aircraft, right? They don't have the same fundamental aerospace bona fides that we have. But they're going maybe, they're going a bridge, not too far, but they are going over a bridge, right? So, I think if we develop the company as, for example, our software group here, There are some aviation experts, but they're mostly transportation experts, right? We've got a team that, they haven't designed aircraft, but they know about transportation, they know about ride sharing, they know about software for this purpose, and, I'm getting in there talking about whenever you get to the aviation specific software, right? Like EFBs and things like this. But, so, if you build it properly, you're not just thinking of yourself as an aerospace company. You're thinking of yourself as a part of transportation. So, in that sense, I think, no, it's not a bridge too far, as long as you segregate properly. I just think that, for the long term, it's likely that it doesn't make sense. It's likely, but things could change. The world has changed several times in the past. It may change in the future. To have all that under one roof where you're really fully trying to go, fully vertically integrated from the passenger all the way to the, raw materials. Is a lot, right? But I think what's more important to me is that in order to have an economically viable aircraft with high utilization, you need to know it, and inside and out. And unless you have a really savvy operator that already knows as well, and you're in there learning together, it's, you just gotta start something up. So, that's the idea.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's interesting that you pointed out that, in this space, because it's a new type of mission, there really are not existing operators that are doing this that you can hand the vehicle over and that you can stay close to and learn from. And so, a lot of people conclude, well, we're going to do the operation ourselves and we're going to learn from it. Do you think that the, size of the business opportunity in that operation. In other words, how big can it be? Can it be the Uber of the skies versus something smaller that is taking, just a piece of existing helicopter operations? Do you think the size of the opportunity impacts that strategic business decision for the company?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I hesitate only because we have this debate internally quite a bit, because there are people in the company and around the world who believe that, that the operation is where it is, right? unlike, I think in, in traditional aviation, famously, the further away you get from the passenger, the more money you make, right? So, somebody, making, some of the oversized fasteners is making quite good money, and whoever's selling the tickets and putting people in the aircraft are not necessarily making as much money. I think we have the opportunity to change that paradigm in this industry. There are those, and usually they're not the aviation traditionalists, who believe that there is more money to be made, if you own the passenger, right? I'm, the numbers, you can build a model that looks great on that. You have to make a lot of assumptions about how much people are willing to pay to fly per mile, how often they're going to fly, what's their disposable income, what's the infrastructure, how much utilization you can get, how many deadhead flights, etc. But there's a world that says you can make a lot of money close to the passenger. But I am an aviation traditionalist. I don't say it's wrong. I do say that I think over time people who just concentrate on that, and they aren't building the vehicles, they aren't writing all the software, but they're taking what's there with good, supplier customer relationships, and concentrating on the passenger concentrating operation. I can't help it, but as a traditionalist, I think that's probably the future, because, when you focus, you go quite strong, but I think we're a ways away from that. most of the, when I talk about, like, some of the vertical lift operators today, we're selling to. They're not particularly high utilization, right? The military, not particularly high utilization, not particularly tricky, right? If you think about, it's not about, I don't know if this answer is going on too long, but if I'm sitting here in Santa Ana, in our facilities in Southern California, a stone's throw from John Wayne Airport, right? But also a stone's throw from several other airports. And, I want to go to Downtown LAX. Well, it's not about me saying, hey, I want to, I'm going to go to John Wayne Airport, pick up an eVTOL, and go to LAX. I'm just going to go into my app and say, I want to, not LAX, let's say Downtown LA. I want to go to Downtown LA. Everything else has to be done behind the scenes. A car's going to come pick me up. Is it going to take me to John Wayne Airport to that eVTOL? I don't know. It might take me somewhere else because the John Wayne eVTOL is full, or is broken down, or isn't going soon enough. But it's, it helps to optimize the fleet for me to go somewhere else. I don't particularly care as a passenger. I just want to get up there, and I've toggled that yes, having an eVTOL is okay. If you talk about, let's say the Uber of the skies, right? Depending on who's optimizing the ecosystem decides. where the value is going to be created. you need to optimize the aircraft fleet to create value for the aircraft. So, by sending somebody to a different vertiport, etc. So, there's a lot of specialism I think that's going to come. We're just developing that out right now to make it possible. And then we'll see, who actually does that in the future. if it's franchise model, etc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's fascinating. this discussion really brings into focus, for me, the fork in the road, that the industry is looking at in terms of how do we bring, fundamentally, we're thinking, how do we bring new technology that manifests in these air vehicles that have new capabilities, right? And how do we bring that into the market? And with the eVTOLs being employed in, a transportation as a service mode, we're looking at one route. And In many cases that, raises this question of does the OEM also take on the operations for the reasons that we've discussed. But, in addition, there's this other route over on the side that is, building an aircraft of a different, size, perhaps a different configuration and bringing it into a market where there are existing operators that can pick it up and start using it, and it looks and feels just like another tail number in the fleet. Or, creating the technology to, to build an aircraft that can sell into the, general aviation community more broadly through, what hopefully will be made a rule through, through the MOSAIC NPRM, and going in that way, It's two very different opportunities with very different journey for the startups that are doing it in a very different risk profile, One that kind of straddles in the middle that comes to mind are the companies that are building the electric short takeoff and landing aircraft, and, perhaps taking a, a different path with the technology, the design of the aircraft, the certification path, but selling into a very different type of market where perhaps there are existing operators, this is just surfacing that contrast, for me. And I think in a very vivid way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it's interesting. Yeah, exactly. And, you I just talked about how much the team has been working on the software side, the kind of transportation focus. We have a team, on industrial design performance that is working with the flight tech team, working with the program, team very closely on, about, like, from the inside out of the aircraft, about how it is to operate, of course. I there could be, and there have been, podcasts about, you know, The big SVNO of Simplified Vehicle Operations. What is that actually? We talk about that a lot in GAMA, etc. of course, what's the training going to be like, etc. How, let's say, easy that may or may not make it to, this aircraft into different types of operations. One thing I have to think about, of course, again, is the cost, right? I developing, it, does take money to develop these aircraft, and not just the design and the certification, but the initial production and the supply chain, right? So, you gotta recoup that somehow, and it to recoup that with volume. And so to sell it, you two, five at a time doesn't necessarily get you there. Although, early on, it can help. I'm happy to have five aircraft go to, to replace five helicopters in a given operator's fleet to help for route proving. But long term, it doesn't necessarily scale. Scale is one of the things that's going to drive it, but yeah, I think there are various opportunities, especially when you come down that manufacturing curve a little bit, and the costs, and hopefully even prices can come down. yes, regulatory aspects are going to have to say about that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Valerie, you call yourself a traditionalist, and as such, how much inspiration and lessons and insights do you draw from the way that jet airliners have been integrated into the air transportation industry in the past, in the 50s, and, how the air carriers themselves changed, or have not changed, by the introduction of, airliners How does that inform your thinking about how this market might unfold?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know, uh, have said this, I don't know if I am actually a traditionalist, I do come from traditional aviation, worked with airlines all around the world, all different, positive and challenging aspects. But really I think the main point is not so much the aircraft, they get more efficient, they have different materials, that's all great. But it's the digital part, right? It's the data, and how that data is used, and how that data unlocks even more value for the OEMs, and for the airlines, and by the way, everybody in between, or maybe not so much in between, but the entire supply chain. The fact that we can do more, predictive, maintenance, the fact that we can do more, you know, fleet optimization, the fact that we know where the aircraft are all the time. We still haven't hit everything in, in, in traditional aviation, meaning, we still pull delays, you know, everybody knows that there are going to be delays into a certain airport on Tuesday morning, you know, nothing ever goes as planned, but we still plan the same way. So there are still things that can be improved. These aircraft, at least our aircraft, you know, it's a all electric, fully digital, fly by wire aircraft, right? We are building in from the beginning this aircraft is going to produce a lot of data. And we're working on who needs the data, how often, for what. And when I say who, it's who within, you know, program, engineering, of course the operational control center, the pilot, the engineers, support services, who needs it live, who needs it just after every flight, who needs it every day, etc. the aircraft itself can be a digital native. And I think that when you talk about battery management systems, you talk about pilot training and being able to do evidence based training based upon all of this data. I think that's going to be revolutionary. We can go really a step further than anyone in aviation is going now and that is, that will help safety, that will help cost, and that will help to unlock value. And I think that, going to be really, I think, an amazing change if we do this properly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Valerie. If we were in your office right now, we looked up at your whiteboard and you as the chief commercial officer, you had a three-year plan on the whiteboard. What would it say? What's an excellent achievement in years. one, two and three.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good one. we have to fly. We have not yet flown the full scale prototype. There are reasons for that. We weren't rushing to fly a non representative prototype. But if you were to come, not in my office, but just outside of my office, and then look through that glass door into one of our main hangars, you see our first full scale prototype. Nicely wrapped in white, it looks like an airplane, um, having some shakedown tests before it goes out to our test facility in Victorville. So, you know, we have to fly and get into that flight test campaign. That means a lot for the suppliers that have been, you know, that working with us, the, customers and, course investors and, everyone else. So, and for the team, it's most important for the team, right? So that's very exciting. So that's getting really into that flight test campaign. It is very important. In parallel to that increasing our, you know, outreach on the, you know, saw what we did with Dallas Fort Worth, City of Arlington. We've got some in the Los Angeles area, increasing our outreach with our let's say various ecosystem partners around the world to help get the world ready for our aircraft. And that comes in various forms of LOIs, MOUs, but, you know, really being able to follow that up with true work that's meaningful to help us mature our concept of operations, to help us mature our software, and to help us mature our, support and services that we're developing. And then I would say the last thing is getting ready for the operation, right? Because again, From the time we start testing our aircraft I think from the first flight, not I think, from the first flight, we are going to be testing, with third party validated noise signature, right? We are going to, of course, be working with the authorities and continue to work with the authorities because we have made a lot of progress with the FAA, on making sure that we're ready, you know, smoothly, hopefully, ready to kind of go into service after certification. Part of that also involves working with, you know, various militaries, right? So it's just really advancing, the aircraft, everything around the aircraft, and then the, of course, commercial and operational aspects of, the aircraft. So that's, what our next years are, all about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned earlier that infrastructure requirements, depending on the mission of the vehicle are not as significant as most people think. If you just use today's infrastructure. There's a lot of value you can create without having to create new requirements. Why are the relationships with DFW and LA so important right now. Why are they in your top three priorities? How does it help drive value to your potential customers? You know, what's the added value of the Dallas and LA provide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I mean, first thing on the infrastructure is, I mean, definitely to fully scale in Advanced Air Mobility, at least vertical lift, bespoke infrastructure will be needed. My point about we have quite a bit of underutilized infrastructure in various parts of the world that we don't need to wait for the bespoke infrastructure in order to start creating value. I mean, that's where I'm getting at. So, for, LA and for Dallas, uh, Dallas Fort Worth Greater Metroplex, I'm starting to learn about the sensitivities of that area. Point is, first of all, you want to be somewhere where you want to be present, somewhere where you have ecosystem players that want to work with you, and in both cases, these are not the most they're densely populated, but they're not a densely concentrated one downtown city of tall buildings that you're trying to fly over. So there are opportunities to have diverse use cases, to, you know, shorten the distance between two points in a way that might be far away, to use these, existing infrastructure to then create bespoke infrastructure inside of that existing infrastructure. Putting a VertiPort at DFW, at Arlington, thinking about how to adapt existing heliports in the area, but having the airspace to, to be able to, you know, do some route proving. So that's really what it is. I mean, it could have been elsewhere, but these are really welcoming partners. And another thing for LA of course is it's a nice ambition to be able to participate in, the innovation that the U. S. would like to showcase or should like to showcase when the L. A. Olympics come here in 2028.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Great. Thank you, Valerie. Hey, what was your, impressions and viewpoints of all the announcements, a couple of weeks ago of the UAM participants in the New York area. What was your reaction to that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I was excited. I mean, more power to my friends in the industry If New York City starts to accept, that's great. It's exciting to see the mayor support it. And because, you know, again, I've mentioned a few times today noise. Like noise, noise, noise, And we understand that New York City is one of the places that is not so excited about helicopters and helicopter noise in general. So it's nice to see some positive reaction. It's a good signal to the market in other cities. That's the key. It's about being a signal. I mean, New York City is, an attractive market if one thinks about just the pure ability to make money if everything is unlocked. It's a huge market. I believe there are high barriers to entry. There will be quite a bit of competition there. So I don't necessarily have desire to be there first as an operator. And by the way, I'm not anti New York. Both my parents were born and raised in New York City. My brother was born in New York. But, um, overall I think it was a very good, uh, message and I'm glad they were able to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Valerie. I'm really curious. talking about the use cases in the different markets as a chief commercial officer, you must be thinking about this constantly. But, give us an insight into the discussions within and among your team about choosing the right go to market strategy, choosing the right use cases to go after, and in particular, the choice between pursuing this UAM or, regional use case where there are, as we discussed, no current operators that you can hand this aircraft to, where there is no clear demonstrated de-risked demand for services. There's so many assumptions, that, it almost hurts. Yet, on the other hand, you might say we can go serve the GA market or a market where an introduction of this kind of vehicle doesn't represent such a big shift in assumptions and behavior and willingness to purchase, et cetera, et cetera. So how are you thinking about this trade off?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I would say it's a little bit of all of the above. that's one of the beauties of the Overair Tilt Rotor design being so versatile. I really do see it as like kind of the utility vehicle, um, where we don't have to sort redesign to meet different markets, but we are looking at both. Look, use cases, regions, geographies, they'll all mature at different rates. And early on where there's appetite and interest and clarity of thought from some existing GA or say, helicopter operators that know that they have, you know, 15 routes and 46 helicopters, I'm making this up. Several of them are, maybe at fixed times and over a fixed distance and they would like to, right? These are interesting targets and, we like talking to them. We can educate them about our vehicle. They can see if it fits, especially if it's an area where we would like to go or we know we can help them. So that's definitely something we're going after. That does not preclude us from trying to open some new opportunities. There are some, airlines out there, there are some other operators out there who are thinking about what to do, and, we are talking to them, but I don't think that precludes us from going, uh, to try to address use cases where our vehicle can shine. I mentioned a little bit earlier the hot and high, like mountainous areas, I mean the tilt rotor, especially a tilt rotor with the size of ours, has a great opportunity to serve from the city to the mountains, for example. And these can be pretty focused, customer base for early use cases, right? So I don't think we just have to pick one or the other. We do have to think about, you know, spreading ourselves thin, are we able to set up, but we have some years to build that. So I don't really see it as one or the other.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When we were preparing for the podcast. And, when we were looking at your vehicle and its capabilities, it appears to be a very low risk vehicle and that the likelihood of execution is quite high, in my opinion, versus some of the other vehicles out there. One of your greater value sets was noise, lower noise. How much greater value is the lower noise to the customer? And it sounds like your noise levels may be lower from those who take great pride and having low noise levels. So how much greater value is the lower noise let's say the community in the New York area. How do you guys quantify it? And is it worth the extra cost of creating lower noise?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first of all, I'm sure the program team will be overjoyed to hear you say that you believe our aircraft is lower risk, so I'll let them know that. I mean, I think noise is, so hard to quantify right now, but it's going to be critical. Because what we're trying to do is, we as an industry, we're trying to do is increase the volume and the number of aircraft that are flying even closer to people than the helicopters are today. So, yes we can quantify 55 decibels, uh, 65 decibels, etc. It's funny, I have a, watch where I have, I always have my decibel meter going and I'm always looking at it just to try to get a feel for, oh, somebody's talking, that's 45, oh, somebody just yelled, that's 75. It's, quite hard, and from, again, from traditional aviation, and I talk to airports, including John Wayne Airport, and, Luton Airport, where you have the people who are always complaining about the noise, and like, there wasn't even a plane overhead, why are you complaining about the noise? Oh, but every day at this time, so it's, there's so much about perception when it comes to noise. The more we push on true noise, the better it will be that we start talking about, you know, visual pollution, noise, but it's just going to be invaluable. So as far as extra development, I mean, the beauty of Butterfly is that it's inherent in the design, right? The fact of the matter is, we have four rotors four propellers, that have a diameter about twice as large as the next largest in the industry, which simply means they're, they're turning more slowly and so you have lower tip speeds and so you have lower noise. On top of that, with our, individual blade control, the optimum speed, individual speed of the, each of the rotors, being able to have that optimum trajectory of the blade as it's going around, no swashplate, everything's in there to reduce vibration, to reduce noise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ctime>1:06:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We had Dr. Bordain on a few weeks ago. And during that podcast, we talked to, to really get to the level of profitability required in UAM that we needed to reach a level of full autonomy, not just autonomous, but full autonomy. Over the next five, 10 years, where do you see the role of UAM as it relates to autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a topic that gets talked about quite a bit. One thing I want to tie back to is what I was talking about at the beginning about flying in Europe versus flying in the US, etc. I mean, one aspect is, again, is scale and, accessibility. Much of the world does not have just free skies, where people do just drive over to the airport and hop in there, you know, pick your GA aircraft of choice at age, you know, however young to however old, and just fly around. You know, you can talk about, Korea, Singapore, China, some places in Asia, uh, other places in Asia, where, you know, the sky is very small, because it's a small country, or it's managed by the military. So you don't have just this plethora of like pilots lying around. So, in some cases you might say, okay, that increases cost. Some cases you might say that's going to drive a path to saying, if you're going to have aircraft operating because you just don't have enough pilots, period, that could drive a speed to autonomy. Um, I think that, yeah, autonomy is going to play a role. I think really what's very important at the beginning is automation. You know, and there's automation with a path to autonomy, and, you know, autonomy it's a big word, right? That is, is it autonomous, meaning just the autopilot's doing everything to autoland? Is it, um, that the aircraft is making its own decisions? Is it, uh, the aircraft is rerouting itself, uh, because it senses weather? I mean, it's just a sliding scale. I think it's going to advance, this will come into vehicles, and, uh, it will come. I don't know at what pace, because then there's social acceptance and regulatory acceptance. The aircraft will be capable of being autonomous before they're allowed to operate autonomously, I believe. Um, so, yeah, it definitely plays a role. As far as the profitability, I would not personally go so far as to say it cannot be profitable until. I do understand that, you know, a decent part of the cost, and we do work quite a lot on unit economics here in our commercial team, a decent part of the cost is piloting cost. However, a big point about having a pilot is also about utilization of the aircraft, right? And here, you know, these flights are so short, you're on the ground so often that I don't think, it's not going to be the pilots that limit the utilization. I mean, I think the biggest profitability driver we see, one of, like, I mean, I'll simplify for effect and say the biggest profitability driver we see is how many hours is your aircraft in the air, right? From how many operating hours a day, from, you know, turnaround times, charging times, deadhead flights, maintenance, out of service, anything that you can imagine, um, you know, TFRs, etc. That's if you can fill the aircraft to a reasonable load factor, which I know is an if. But that's regardless of whether there's a pilot in the aircraft or not. You know, that utilization is key. And yes, pilots are part of that cost, but they're not driving the utilization. So, first we have to get people wanting to fly on these aircraft, um, have to get the aircraft at high utilization from a maintenance standpoint, from a regulatory standpoint, and then yes, you increase profitability if you can, perhaps, lower the human, cost. Perhaps that has an impact on safety, perhaps that has an impact on accessibility because you don't have to train so many pilots. We'll see where that goes. I mean, yeah, it's a, it's a big and interesting question.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:09:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Valerie, what advice would you give to someone who wants to start a business in this new chapter of aviation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:09:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you know, it's a unique opportunity, right? To help write the rules and the playbook for all aspects of the industry. It's possible that profit sharing and go to market could be very different than traditional aviation. So one advice, piece of advice I would give is don't only think of it as aviation. we We are a part of transportation. We are a new, mode of transportation that ties to the rest. And so I think that's, one piece. Another piece is don't be naive. You know, take the regulations, rules, safety requirements of aviation seriously. And the last I would say is be clear, and this goes to being naive, be clear that there is a lot of capital required in advance of revenue generation. So you really have to have conviction regarding the addressable market, your target. And frankly, that's regardless of whether you're an OEM or even an operator in the early, days. There's still capital requirements, right? So, um, yeah, so I would say that, but it's, it's, a fantastic, uh, it's a fantastic world. I love being in it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Valerie, is there one point that you would like to leave the audience with as we wrap up?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Valerie:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, again, I think I've built this in somewhere, but I am so glad that there's a push in aviation and aerospace that can serve to attract new talent and passion and help us compete with industries. And that's advanced air mobility, as I said, that's, you know, hydrogen, uh, there's a new space. It's just, it's really exciting to be able to, you know, be part of something that's really innovative, but it's something that's so fundamental to to kind of the, the, the heritage of, uh, of the industry as well.

Welcome back to The Vertical Space for a deep dive into the medical delivery use case, or I should say another deep dive into this interesting topic. We've had guests in the past notably Justin Steinke from Spright, where we talked about the medical delivery use case from an operator and drone expert perspective. This time we get to hear from Stuart Ginn, who besides having a professional aviation background is also a physician and therefore looks at the drone opportunity through the lens of a healthcare professional, somebody engaged in delivering healthcare and intimately familiar with the complexities associated with it. We've covered a lot of ground in this conversation, starting with a description of the existing internal logistics systems within the large healthcare system. And more importantly, its current problems that drones might successfully address. And we do this in the context of macro factors that healthcare faces in providing access to clinical services, to rural areas. We compare the B2B medical drone delivery business model to that of the B2C consumer delivery and have a lively discussion around which is more likely to become a killer app first. The opinion that the B2B medical drone delivery use case is a promising market opportunity is commonly shared in the industry. However, what is not adequately discussed is exactly how this value will be realized what matters to hospitals and what the ultimate product needs to look like to ensure wide adoption. Here's where Stuart's insights really stand out. For instance, instead of thinking about drones as part of a transportation system,Stuart believes they should be considered as an extension of the infrastructure, not unlike pneumatic tubes in hospitals today. As usual we go deep ask tough questions and uncover interesting insights, not widely shared. Stuart is an ENT head and neck surgeon and innovation leader at WakeMed Health and Hospitals in Raleigh, North Carolina where he also leads system wide innovation efforts as the medical director of WakeMed Innovations. At WakeMed Innovations, he led the inception and implementation of the nation's first drone based medical package delivery system. WakeMed innovations has also developed a novel hospital, integrated health venture model, the WakeMed innovations venture fund, which Stuart leads in partnership with regional venture partners. Stuart is also the co-founder and president of CAHM the coalition for advanced health mobility, a nonprofit working to drive innovation and impact for emerging mobility technologies and human health. Stuart received his medical training at Wake Forest university school of medicine and completed his specialty training in ENT Head and Neck surgery at Stanford university.

I don't think the killer app is necessarily retail and consumer delivery. I think some version of, B2B healthcare related Operation and service may be the killer app, but it's obviously a biased, a heavily biased perspective. when I go to conferences and when I hear other people talk about this, I'm just always looking at this through the lens of an unmet need in healthcare. the second thing is, and I'll just briefly say that this is sort of not related, but obviously there's a lot of concern around Using drones is an example that there's going to be a significant public backlash around, the presence of drones in airspace and in communities. And based on what we've seen, and we'll get into this later, I'm sure, based on what we've seen, in my healthcare system as we use drones, it's just not something we saw. I don't think there's going to be much of a significant backlash. I think we should be mindful of it, but I don't think it's going to be. we're sort of post privacy as a society. And so I think it might not be as big of an issue for companies as others might believe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This will be a very interesting conversation based on opening remarks. So, how about this? let's start framing the conversation, towards the unmet need in healthcare that you just surfaced. tell us why did you and your hospital WakeMed get involved with drones? What is it that is either broken or slowly breaking in healthcare that drone technology is uniquely suited to fix. Give us a bit of a high level context before we start going into more about the current way of moving things in the healthcare system and how drones can then improve that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, so that's a great question. When I started, when I came to WakeMed, we started organizing what we now call WakeMed Innovations, which is sort of a division inside Our healthcare system that looks at innovation capacity and resourcing internally, does a lot of strategic partnerships and thinks about technology, onboarding, all that kind of healthcare related stuff. And when I arrived, they were looking at several large problem sets that The healthcare system is facing in delivering care. We're a growing healthcare system in a really fast growing market, multiple hospitals, multiple freestanding, facilities and physician locations, just a big expanding footprint, and we are a big level one trauma center that is community facing, and takes care of everybody in our region, and our region is blended between urban and semi urban and even rural to a certain extent, but one of the big problems that we were having was our courier network and essentially our internal, logistics and supply chain. they were very unhappy with the level of service and visibility they were getting. They knew they were spending too much money on it. They were wondering, is there a way we can do this better? They were unhappy they had gone through several vendors, third party vendors to try to fix the courier operations and they were just unhappy. So at the time they were considering, bringing it in house and standing up their own operation. that provided sort of a framework for us to start thinking about other ways to provision those services. How do we face our footprint growth and deliver new services and care economically? That's a very tricky set of problems for a healthcare system. But, at the time, and this is 2015 to qualify that in terms of timing, I had a parallel interest in drones and aviation because of my aviation background. And so we started spitballing what it might look like. So theoretically, what does it look like if we provision that service? what if we could connect our facilities through a simple connected drone network? and at the time we knew this wasn't legal or possible, but we also knew that there was progress being made, at least there were hints of progress being made on the regulatory front. So we kind of endeavored to put together a theoretical network. What would this look like, if we, instead of pneumatic tubes inside of our walls, which are ubiquitous for our healthcare system, like many others, connecting, you know, nursing departments and internal to our facilities, connecting people. What if we could do that with drones connecting our other facilities. So we looked at what we're carrying what are the payloads and they were mostly small blood samples, about two thirds of what our couriers were carrying between our facilities were very small, high value packages such as blood samples and small devices, and even inter facility mail. So it was a fit in terms of potential payload. And so we built this theoretical network. what would this look like? And then can we go find partners, who might be willing to model this with us, and who might be willing to, you know, someday in the future when this is possible, provision this with us. And we found Matternet, who I had a relationship with, when I was doing my training in California. And, they were interested in addressing healthcare as a vertical. And so together, we put together this theoretical network. And this was around the time that the IPP, the Integration Pilot Program was being discussed. And eventually when it was published and opened, we had assembled this group of partners, including the North Carolina DOT aviation division and other partners. And so we proposed this network as a pilot site and then were selected and then later UPS joined, as a potential operator. So, essentially, we started with what we've found to be a really sticky, difficult problem for a growing healthcare system. It started in a very theoretical realm, and then we had this opportunity to do it and run a pilot operation for a few years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Stuart, what is it about the existing internal hospital logistics and supply chains that makes\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>the customer so unhappy with? Can you tell us a little bit more about that? that's a great question. so I'm going to qualify this as, it's highly variable. I always say this saying healthcare, sort of big H healthcare, U. S. healthcare implies that all these healthcare systems are the same and they're just not, they're very heterogeneous and, there's a lot of market dynamics, a lot of consolidation and regionalization and mergers with healthcare systems. But the bottom line is that most healthcare systems face a growing demand, if they are in sort of urban areas or areas with fast population growth. they are engaging in lots of consolidation where they're onboarding new facilities and trying to figure out how to integrate operations And if they're in rural areas, they're facing the opposite problem. Hospital and facility closures because of the economics of it, so they're further and further away from their patients, and their patients are having trouble accessing services. So the pressure and the demand for courier services and sort of specialty delivery services to link all these facilities together both near and far is increasing. as sort of a tailwind, the industry is very fragmented, meaning, healthcare couriers and logistics are, as an industry, are highly fragmented. The service levels are traditionally very poor, they are often third parties, and their business models are not very strong, they're probably low margin businesses, and so they can't often provide a very strong value proposition for the healthcare system, and they can't make their customers happy. There's very little visibility for the healthcare system inside that supply chain, that internal supply chain and logistics provision. So we don't know where things are, where they're going. it's hard to pull data because of that, and so... there's limited data into what you're sending where, and so there's a lot of decentralization of control and it's a very catch as catch can as an, as a system and as an operation. reliability is low, costs are high. It's all the things you'd expect. It's a system that's just begging for disruption. and, maybe one dimension that's important here is as healthcare systems are under this increasing pressure, they're also getting serious that for years they could ignore this kind of, you know, logistics and supply chain were just a side function and it was all about delivering care. Over the last 20 years, it's become clear that healthcare systems have to get really good at back of house, functions like supply chain and logistics to stay competitive. So there's an increasing focus on them, but most healthcare systems don't know where to start. Mine, for instance, did not have even a single, there was no division or person whose job was to look at supply chain and logistics internally. They were using a finance guy because he was good with numbers. So, so for all those reasons, the levels of service in the industry are poor, and there's just a lot of fragmentation and high cost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>the description of the pain points that hospitals today are experiencing. if we look into the future and we imagine that, drone technology and operations are pushed forward against this pain point in this use case, what do you see as the ideal solution that drones grow into to address this?

Well, I mean, this is probably a pretty sophisticated audience on this pod, who's very familiar with the roadblocks and the hurdles facing drone operations as an example from a regulatory standpoint, but in a future state where the regulatory environment has matured, where distributed beyond line of sight operations are feasible and somewhat scalable, then what is needed is a shift in mindset away from, these are components of our transportation system and provision towards, these are parts of our buildings and infrastructure. where we got traction internally at WakeMed as we were pitching this and populating this idea around was it was very difficult to get folks on board when we were just talking about cannibalizing, courier operations using a drone. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty from a technology and regulatory and safety and social license standpoint around that tech, especially in 2015. But the bigger question was the economics. I mean, does this make any sense? I mean, how much cheaper is it going to be? Is it going to be reliable? But as we started operating the system, even on a very meager, sort of modest scale, connecting two facilities, the questions that started pouring in and the thinking for the organization was Well, when we can expand this becomes a tube system, this becomes a new pneumatic tube system, and it's flexible and nodal and we can push it around to, different facilities, you know, on an as needed basis. So what we want is sort of a distributed network of routes and drone operations that we can use more like an open system and less like a, okay, these are drones that are here to move blood samples. What we need, in its highest form would be an open system that's accessible by lots and lots of people inside the healthcare system which, basically creates an opportunity to connect all those different locations and allows us to then provision new services at these new locations. For instance, there's lots of places we could draw blood samples. for our patients, but, transporting those samples back to our central lab is expensive. and, essentially, we then have to tell the patients, well, instead of us moving your blood sample, we're going to have you move yourself to that facility and have your blood drawn, well this kind of technology obviates the need for that and it moves the things and the goods around instead of the people, when we're talking about drones, I think in its best form, it's an open, accessible network that connects infrastructure and allows for sort of a flexible use over time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in a way you're saying that the demand for using this system is going to come from lots of different parts of the organization and it needs to be really low friction, in order to provision a movement of something from point A to point B, kind of analogous to the pneumatic tube that, anybody can walk up and use it, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's right. I think it's all about access to this system. And obviously when you're planning operations in the early stages, and we'll probably talk about this as, as well, but you need to model your economics and your operation around some Quote, use case. All right. What is it? How do we compare the cost of moving blood samples with a drone versus with a van? Or, you know, there's lots of examples, but the real value is this pent up hidden demand. And what you really want is to provide an open, accessible system and then let the users within the healthcare system help teach you how they're going to use it. and not for nothing, the data that will generate would be substantial and very valuable to our healthcare system. Again, we have very little, sort of perspective, understanding, and visibility for what we're moving where. And that ties very closely to the services we're delivering in those places. And that kind of insight could be incredibly valuable to us. As we try to shape our delivery services and serve our patients in all the different places where they live. It's\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>interesting on the last mile delivery side to consumers, companies are working on a very easy, seamless way to provision a movement. But it's people who are, consumers who have their phone and they're using an app just like they would use DoorDash or the equivalent, to have something, be delivered to them. And they're working to make that very seamless. But what you're talking about in this context is, provisioning a movement that is, you know, come and pick this thing up, or I need to move this sample from where I am to a lab or to a hospital. and... It's a little more heterogeneous, the set of different, movements that people are going to initiate, and really how that use case integrates in with all the different parts of the hospital system. and I wonder, is this going to standardize? Is this going to... become a system that, is copied, across different hospital, groups in very similar form, or will it be different, from, from hospital system to hospital\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>19:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>system? Oh, I said, that's like the million dollar question. I hope there's an opportunity for it to be different Because that means that the companies and innovators who are trying to drive use of this technology in healthcare are delivering, accessible systems and letting the healthcare users define their use in ways that are unique to their needs and communities. I know it's difficult to model a system when you're going to just say out loud, well, our assumption is that we don't know what's going to be used for. I'm not saying it has to be that clean, but I do think it will be different based on the demographics of the system, where they are, how it's configured geographically. Is this a rural spacing system, is it an urban system, is it a hybrid like mine? there's so much heterogeneity inside healthcare delivery, it'll depend on what services they're trying to deliver. I mean, the big picture is, what you want is this to be a set of tools that moves us further down, directionally, aligned towards decoupling services from locations, right? You want to be able to deliver more services in more locations. And by the way, that impacts the economics. I mean, the big picture on the economics for this. Now, this is maybe another thing that others don't agree with me or, I know I'm not alone in this thought, but. The real economics are not going to be driven around operations and cost savings on going head to head with vehicles. I think it's going to be all about, infrastructure costs. you can use tools like this to deliver services to more people in more places without spending an enormous amount of money on infrastructure and physical buildings, or technology having to be co-located in different places, just to provision those services. so those are the real economic drivers for this. Obviously, that's hard to model, and it's the kind of thing that has to develop over time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's interesting, you describe, really there needs to be a period of operational experimentation with, drone deliveries in a medical context, in order to figure out how each use case works most efficiently, or how it works with each of the different hospital systems, based upon their history. And right now, we're in the early stages of that. we're working on, making the movements technically possible, operationally safe and compliant, but figuring out how to integrate them to that use case in the way that really works the best for the stakeholders seems like another chapter and, you know, it just raises questions about, okay, how quickly can this scale, for companies that are going into medical deliveries and making a bet on building a business around that if each hospital system is its own different thing, and if the end customers still have a lot of learning to do on their own in terms of how they want to interact\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>22:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>with it. Yeah, I very much agree. I'm obviously an apologist for this technology in healthcare, but what we've seen at WakeMed and, you know, just as somebody like you who watches this industry very closely is obviously the time, the timelines have not contracted. They have been protracted. And some of that is tied up in regulatory, Constraints and inertia, but we're still on step one. Like you said, we're just trying to figure out how to move these things safely around, facilities and cities and communities. We really haven't had to address the deeper integration pieces that one is community and social license. We have and there's a lot of activity on that front and we're thinking about the environmental impact and the noise impact. That's all great. Some of that's tied up in the regulatory pathway as well, but we really haven't had to face okay well, how do you integrate this, and provide sort of a platform that the end user can direct and use. If it's top down, this is one of the mistakes a lot of people in the industry are making. If you're trying to run it like an airline, okay, we're going to come in, the FAA told us we're an airline, and we are regulated like an airline, so now we're going to operate like an airline, and you just call us when you need us to move something. That is not going to work. so there'll be an another set of steps around integration technology and how do you provide a user interface for these technologies and they will probably like a lot of other advanced mobility technologies need to work in sort of a multimodal integrated system they need to be able to, be able to be integrated into a healthcare systems transportation network seamlessly. and in fact, maybe a significant source of potential for this industry will be that once those problems are solved and there are companies that are addressing integration and interface I think it will probably end up improving the overall transportation mix and multimodality for healthcare systems in general and may move the needle on some of those other adjacent, transportation place.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>can you give us a little bit more insight into the types of movements that currently exist? what types of cargo, what are the distances, what are the endpoints? walk us through that chain of movement for all the goods today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, okay, great question. and I'll qualify this right up front. With one of the problems is, this is... Poorly understood, even among healthcare systems. I mentioned earlier. That there's very poor visibility and often healthcare systems as groups and organizations who are now trying to manage internal or contracted logistics, function, the precision of the data around this is poor and highly variable, in the U. S. at least. So to, to qualify this is we're guessing frankly, now there are healthcare systems that probably have much more insight and increasingly so. For instance, I bet if you get somebody from Kaiser or Intermountain Healthcare, they have a much more sophisticated view of what's being moved around their healthcare system and when. And I'm, I would be willing to bet, in fact, I know that for those large integrated ground up systems, they think very hard and carefully about, logistics provision when they think about new services. All that said... based on the data, for instance, at my hospital system, so we're about a 1. 6 billion per year system, we have about a thousand beds across three hospitals, a level one trauma center, we have four or five freestanding ERs slash multi, imaging facilities, with clinics, and then we have 70 or 80 position practices that we either own or partner with in our community. And that's spread across, Roughly 20 miles in diameter from our central hospital. in our system, what's moving around two thirds of the time is blood samples. A small additional percentage is inter office mail, and rarely large, one off, unpredictable, imaging equipment, and then obviously in the small parcel, piece is pharmacy. So. we don't have a large transportation footprint on pharmacy currently because we're not a pharmacy distributor, but certainly there is a demand for that inside of our system, but I don't have data to support how much of the lift that accounts for. let me use a blood sample as a, as an example. So say a patient is seeing a physician and the physician or NP or PA decides I'm working this patient up and I need a blood test of a certain type. They're typically going to be doing that and delivering that care out in the community in a practice, or increasingly in a retail pharmacy, or in a minute clinic in your Target, or in a physician's office. they may have the ability to draw the blood sample there, but often they do not, and the reason they don't is because there's no point in drawing the blood if they don't have a way to provision transportation of that, sample back, to the laboratory for processing. If it's a integrated practice like the ones I work in a practice owned by my healthcare system. Well, if I need, a sample moved from my office, then there's a courier that's going to pick it up, but they're typically going to pick that up on an optimized schedule, you know, where they stop at my facility a couple of times during the day, or maybe once during the day, if it's really important, I can call for a stat courier and just have a courier drive out and pick it up and ship it back to the lab as a one off. the costs obviously increase as you move up. So you move from highly inefficient to highly expensive across that spectrum. the blood sample either way will eventually make it back to my central lab, which for us is located at our main hospital. It will then get processed, probably in a batch, at some point, and then the result will get entered into the electronic medical record. This process takes, On an outpatient basis, getting the data that the doctor needs from the decision of ordering the lab to getting the data is too long. It is often a day or sometimes more, and it often depends on the patient's ability to travel into a place where they can have their blood drawn. obviously, if we could draw that blood sample reliably on site, because we knew we had a reliable system, a pneumatic tube system, where we could just draw the sample, put it on the drone and send it back to the main campus on demand, and it arrives 10 minutes later, and we can see that device moving through a system. and it's safe and accounted for. all of those things are probably going to be improved with drones. Then the turnaround time on that. A clinical data reaching back to the ordering physician, and therefore a decision being made, will be markedly improved.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stuart, let me ask you a question on that. So you've described then, if I may, I'm at a doctor's office, I had my blood drawn. The blood work is often centralized at the end of the day, and it's brought to a centralized So, you have your hospital system has their own lab, as opposed to, you know, some other, larger national labs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Quest or LabCorp. We do both, but yes, that's correct. We actually do both. Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>and you just described one of the major values of this, I love your pneumatic\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>tube system. I love that analogy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>when you were answering some of Luka's initial questions, you were initially describing a cost advantage. Right. And then you described a data advantage. partly, we don't even know what we don't know as it relates to the samples and where they're going and the like. But when you gave him more specifics, you described a clinical value advantage. Yes. The turnaround time. So which is it? what's the biggest driver here? The cost I'm having a little hard time with, unless you get to rural communities, that the cost of the drone is going to be more effective than the carrier. However, you did say reliability as well, and I know the courier networks, there's almost nothing nationalized, and I'm sure they're very unreliable. But are you saying the principal value is the clinical value of the faster turnaround for the blood test? Because for all intents and purposes, it doesn't seem that the turn time for 90 percent of the blood work is that critical. What's the biggest driver that gets you most passionate about the use of drones for the movement of blood samples?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's a great question. So, obviously as a, maybe the way I'm speaking of this and thinking about it, it's just kind of, Implied, I realize that I take it for granted that at the bottom of this, there's just like, as a doctor trying to deliver care, I want systems that really support that and give me what I need and what my patient needs as quickly as possible. I think it's sort of taken for granted, potentially, for me as an on the ground doc, that The driver for this would be faster turnaround. I'd like to believe that's going to be the driver, for purchasers of these services. And I believe that, actually, from an economic standpoint, it will certainly look a lot different than, for instance, retail, you know, point to point delivery or direct to consumer delivery for retail. meaning the appetite for a healthcare system, the willingness to pay for a system that promotes improved turnaround time and improved care and improved throughput through, for instance, our lab, maybe decreases batching phenomenon, improves turnaround for healthcare. But, you know, for better or for worse, our administrators are operating on our behest. if we want it and we need it faster, they're going to be willing to pay up to a certain point. So I do think that the economics will drive it, like every other purchase decision that gets made in the healthcare system, but the appetite and the willingness to pay for delivering a better experience for the patient and a better quality of care will be significant in the economics of drone delivery in healthcare. I hope I'm not wrong about that. I saw it at my healthcare system when to qualify this answer, I'll say that, you know, we were doing a really relatively high profile innovation project that included this at its core. but we paid for it and we funded that. My healthcare system funded that there was no outside funding for our, provisional drone operation that we did with the IPP. we funded it because we see significant. potential for the future of our operation and our ability to expand, into new areas. I will say that, tied to that clinical turnaround and quote speed, of data sort of return is that idea that we talked about earlier, which is in a world where this technology exists in my healthcare system, they're going to think differently. I've seen them do it. They're going to think differently about what services they can provide where. That opens up service. provision in new locations, and the economics of that are typically positive. So, I do think it's a little nuanced, but I definitely think that the big picture driver will be better care delivery and new services in new locations. So,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stuart, your opening remarks underlined your belief in the killer application being a B2B healthcare, use case. And so as we're having this conversation, I have a couple of question marks bouncing around in my head. So here's the trouble that I'm having in this conversation. It seems like the bar is fairly low in terms of the overall dissatisfaction with existing methods of moving things around in a hospital environment. It also seems like the demand is clearly there. There are structural tailwinds that are supporting new technologies and drones. Yet you're describing a very complex, heterogeneous system in which there is no clear way to, to come up with a solution that can scale. And I can see how the entrepreneurs in our audience might be. You know, weary of, jumping into something that doesn't really have a straight line to scaling. So, at the same time, the airspace integration problem is a lot easier in a B2B environment. You de risk a few routes as opposed to, ad hoc routes of delivering to consumers. Yet, when we look at the reality of the market, the last mile consumer delivery market is, getting to a point of fair level of maturity. And yet, in the medical delivery... Use case, not really have advanced meaningfully past, POCs. So, what's rooted in your belief that B2B medical delivery is the killer app and how do we get to that point, given everything that we've discussed so far?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, well, that's a. That's an impossibly large question. I love that question. No, I think that is the difficult question that's sort of the elephant in the room. So, thinking about this, as somebody looking at, I mean, we spend a lot of time in the healthcare system looking at healthcare technology very broadly. And to qualify this, Look, this is one of the mistakes a lot of people are, are making, is that this is a tool, like using drone delivery as an example, a tool in the emerging advanced mobility stack, this is the classic chicken and egg, just like it is for multimodal transportation systems in cities. If healthcare systems are sort of microcosmic in that sense, then, the value has to be driven by very flexible, multi modal systems with a deep level of integration. how do you... Justify those costs and does that offset the scale required all those issues you just brought up. I will say this, part of this is sort of in terms of why would healthcare, big H, be a potential killer app or a really productive place to experiment and to build business in this industry. Is there for one thing, the definition of health care is changing and it contains B2B, which in the short term helps mitigate some regulatory risk And, you know, because it's predictable networks and, it helps, connect the operations to a public benefit, which could be helpful from a standpoint of when you get down to the local, regional level of governments and citizens trying to justify the presence of this technology in the public domain, I think that B2B healthcare application mitigates some of that, but increasingly healthcare, it means B2C. I mean, I look at what's happening in retail pharmacies where patients are getting healthcare in more and more locations, often at their retail pharmacy. But these retail pharmacies, despite, the Minute Clinics and the CVSs who are investing heavily in healthcare, they still can't manage a patient's full spectrum of disease and healthcare need. Those patients still have to be connected to the integrated healthcare systems in their communities. And this is an example of a technology that can bridge that gap, that connects traditional healthcare models to emerging B2C models, and your pharmaceuticals could be delivered, and blood sample kits could be delivered and retrieved. Lots of potential in the future. but I think it's important to say that out loud, that it's not going to necessarily have to stop in terms of scale at, okay, this is a hospital network, they have five locations, you're going to put drones on those five locations. I think that as regionalization and distributed healthcare. systems emerge, and as new business models emerge in healthcare, the traditional brick and mortar healthcare systems are going to have to learn to partner with those kinds of companies, and you're going to see much more emphasis on pushing this out into the community, and this is a set of tools that can sort of help facilitate that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>okay, I'm still not convinced, I still didn't get the main reason, in your opinion, why we're observing this relative immaturity of medical drone deliveries relative to consumer deliveries. And, you know, perhaps something that you raised earlier, which I thought was very interesting that, maybe is the answer And that is that some people make a mistake of operating the service as an airline, and you say, hey, call us when you need something to be moved. Whereas, you're highlighting the importance of finding the right interfaces and right integration points. Is that the primary challenge needs to be overcome, or is it something else? I don't think it's regulation. I don't think that it's BVLOS. I think, that's becoming an increasingly\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>easier thing to do. So, so that's interesting. I think I agree that the regulatory part of, so maybe then, I know maybe we can unpack that a little bit. So in your view, the regulatory side is not enough of a constraint to explain why healthcare applications have not grown faster. Is that what you mean? Is that what I'm hearing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, I think it's a lot easier for a sophisticated operator to go in front of the FAA or EASA and present safety case for, the combined air and ground risk over\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>a few routes. Right, right. But are we seeing legitimate progress in terms of beyond line of sight operations? So, so can a drone company, any drone company or operator in today's environment approach a healthcare system, say, show me a map of your facilities and I will develop a network connecting all these locations, and that will allow me to develop an operational model, and that will allow me to calculate the economics, and that will allow me to determine how much I need to charge you for this service. I don't think we're there. I don't think the companies in the space are in a position to offer sort of a rational, scaled network, even on a pretty modest scale. so I don't know. I think that there's a component of this where nobody is able to sell the product off the shelf quite yet at least in the United States. Now, I'm much less familiar and up to date on what's going on internationally.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it comes back to, when somebody comes up in front of the healthcare, leadership team, and, pitches something like the drone delivery network, is this currently understood as something that is a nice to have, or is it a must have?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, no, that's a great way to put it. Now, in its current state, it's absolutely not a must have. Part of that, I think, is because, I mean, this is literally why WakeMed, my system, shut down our pilot, because our initial plan was to connect multiple facilities, and we understood that economics of it were... Going to need to be developed with our partners as we went. It was very early. and so they didn't have their model, ironed out. But after three years operating the same route with no prospect of even adding a single beyond line of sight route, in front of us, the internal optics were, well, We're done with the innovation project. This needs to move towards ROI. and the model said, well, until we can add three or four different hospitals, we can't justify this. As a customer, we can't justify its expense. so I think that's constraining things a lot as we have an alternative, right? I mean, couriers exist. it's not a great system. the industry will have to mature to the point where companies can come in and do what I said earlier, offer a relatively. affordable, off the shelf option, to connect multiple facilities and then operate them, and or, and even better, let the healthcare system operate them, in air quotes. so I don't disagree with you. I mean, I think that... Currently, in its current form, and what is available in terms of product and service, it's not a must have. It's a nice to have. how do we get there, was the second part of the question, and gosh, I don't know. I think it's progress on multiple fronts, you know, like death by a thousand cuts. it's slow progress on regulatory, and it's BVLOS. It's, the ability of, operators and drone providers to develop their own productive business models so that they can reasonably charge healthcare systems, something that, that they're willing to pay. but I don't know if there's, I don't have the answer, I don't think, for that, for how do we get, you know, it's a classic chicken or egg, but undeniably additional pilot projects, and each time there's a step forward in operational capability, either regulatory or technology wise, a step needs to get taken by somebody, in some capacity, and the tools need to get increasingly put into the hands of the healthcare users. And customers, or else, will never cross that chasm.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stuart, so, digging in a little bit to the economic question, for operators to come forward with, if we assume that, BVLOS gets done, we step into a scenario where that's there, and where multiple hospitals can be networked together with these routes. from the three years that you were... Operating the pilot. Did you get a feel or, supporting data from that experience that would, tell us what the utilization level of drones in this type of a future network would be? Because the utilization throughout the day is going to be a big driver to the economics and to the cost of it. In consumer operations, we have data from the pilots that have been run that allow us to look ahead and extrapolate. In this case, what do you see? Because on the one hand, lightly utilized drones, Are, going to be expensive on a variable operating basis, obviously, but if the system is heavily utilized, then the system needs to be tolerant to, capacity limitations at a certain point. And I don't know if these movements, can tolerate those types of delays. Or contingencies and failures and things like that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So, great question. Now, our utilization, we connected one freestanding outpatient surgery center slash clinic slash imaging center across a major road, to our hospital, which as the crow flies was a third of a mile so not a long distance, but, every blood sample, we had some exclusions because we didn't want critical samples such as pathology samples where the cost of loss of one would be high just because we were in a sort of a pilot phase, but every blood sample between those two facilities instead of being carried and being batched onto the couriers three times a day was delivered on an hourly and later every half hour basis by our operator, which was UPS. Again, this was configured more like a scheduled airline. It was every half hour or hour during business hours, that drone flew a payload across so our utilization was very high. We were finding that we were able to cover all of the lab samples in a given day that needed to move between those two facilities, with a little bit of additional payload room left, but that's because of the nature of the payload, which was small blood samples, even on a small drone. so I think that the utilization will be high if it's available. And again, the caveat is that this is a scheduled scenario, the real answer to that question is what is utilization when it's not scheduled and it's just available for use when it's a pneumatic tube system. So I don't know that answer\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So at the end of the day, let's say a given day, Stuart, during your trial, you had the hourly service being run by the drone versus the accumulated courier service at the end of the day. so first of all, how did the cost compare, one\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>versus the other? Yeah. So, yes. and to be a little bit more precise. I think the way it was set up that courier stop, I think it was three or four pickups per day, or three pickups per day. versus hourly. the cost data is Artificial. it was an innovation cost. We were paying, um, UPS, or more specifically, Matternet, to operate the, in other words, it wasn't the result of sort of a real operational set of costs. But even, so, my point is, I don't think it was, economically feasible for the operator. They were losing money. For one thing, they had human beings on both sides of the route, and so the automation or autonomy piece was not there, which is probably key to the, to this. So, the cost data is artificial. They were not making money on this contract they were using it to feed their growth as a company and their, funding cycle and all those things. I don't know if I have an honest answer for that. I'll tell you that on a per delivery basis we obviously knew what it cost. for routine deliveries between those two facilities, we were looking at something on the order of$15 per delivery. For stat on demand deliveries, it's like$50 per delivery over that third of a mile and the average, we have data on the average delivery time and with huge variability because of the batching phenomenon the average was still. two to four hours. And with the drone operation, it was ten minutes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>48:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let me jump on that, if I may, just for a minute. you mentioned pathology was removed, because clearly, there can be a time component in pathology, like for a cold section or something like that, where there's enormous time implications. But, most pathology, even if it's... You know, one to two, two to four days, not a lot is going to be done different, whether I get it in a day or four days. I know there's exceptions to that. But even blood work, when you're saying non critical, the, blood work, how much is going to be done different because I get it at ten o'clock rather than I get it at four in the afternoon? what's outcome is going to be different as a result?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, so that's a good question. The belief inside my healthcare system was that yes, batching phenomenon is significant, it's a problem they're trying to solve, and a theoretical system where you could smooth out, and make the cadence of drop offs at the lab more predictable and even across the day would have significant impact into turnaround times And probably the economics and the efficiency of the use of those machines And at least internally it was believed that was addressable with a system like drones putting aside the fact that we didn't understand yet what the cost would be and probably still don't but we knew Where the highest volume of labs were coming in and we knew when, so we, would know how to target that as an intervention. So there is a belief that smoothing out of batching phenomenon will have significant clinical and economic benefits. Again, the thing that our system got most interested in was okay, if we have excess capacity, and to some extent we're always going to have batching, then if we have the ability to send blood samples more fluidly from more locations using something like a drone system that was economically, tolerable, that would improve both the services we could deliver in our community, the locations where we could do it, and then... That could be used to improve the operations of our commercial lab. I mean, that's a revenue generating business for my healthcare system. So the more labs we can put through the system, and the more smoothly and reliably we can do them and the more efficient we can be, the better. Now the hard economics of that are still TBD, obviously, because we've never had to, Negotiate with a drone company around what the cost of this service will be and that's where all the uncertainty is currently\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>if you're going to create kind of the perfect scenario for The type of sample that would be moved whether it be tissue versus blood and let's say the community for which it is for let's say rural versus urban What's the perfect scenario that you would say you would lay out for the use of drone delivery for medical samples?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>right, so The pressing healthcare need. So what I'm hearing is what's the best use case for drones for, and we're still talking about blood samples, or you said any potential use. Right. Okay. Got it. Yeah. So, so that's a great question. I think that, so the most pressing clinical need we face maybe as a country, is access to clinical services for folks in rural locations. And obviously the more distance that's interposed between patients and the services, the higher the cost of movement between them and the higher the cost of provisioning that care and the poorer quality of care because they are less likely to access health care when they need it. so my answer would be, delivering, even basic, preventative services in rural areas. I do think that blood samples are a great way to do that, on the cheap. and so again, I think it's less likely, for instance, we mentioned pathology samples, well that means there's a surgeon operating in that rural location, and that's not going to happen, because Those surgeons are all consolidated back in the central location. But patients being able to access basic preventative and maintenance services like laboratory services. or, sort of reversing that provision of lightweight but important medical supplies such as test kits to more locations in rural communities and the practices that serve them. I think that is the most valuable potential, use case for drones in the U. S. healthcare system as it stands now. all of this is about drones. We're not even touching... Movement of people, which Advanced Air Mobility can touch on, you know, in the future, but in terms of goods and, provision of services, it's obvious that the greatest need is in rural locations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we've addressed this from a few angles already, but, how would you summarize what will it take to succeed as a drone operator serving the healthcare community for the movement of goods?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>for one thing, like you would tell any startup in any space, when you're thinking about the product and service you're trying to deliver, you need to really understand those customers and what they need from you. I think a lot of what it will take is people really digging in and understanding how health care provision works, how chaotic it can be, how the businesses behind them struggle to provision care, including the pieces like logistics. I think these companies and entrepreneurs need to be razor focused. If they're going to go into a niche like health care, they need to be razor focused on those customers. and what they need and what are the jobs that they need done. they don't need more technology. They don't care about more technology. They care about the services they deliver and the patients they're taking care of. So, just deep focus on the healthcare customer will help shape the offering and I think also will be competitively very important for companies that want to engage in the healthcare space. I know that's a common answer, but it's really not something that we're seeing. Again, it's still small as an industry, and the healthcare portion is even smaller. But the interactions we've had with various drone operators and companies are really looking at this. A lot of them are looking at it as a piece of technology and they're shopping around for the best way to use it. and healthcare looked good to some of them early on because... Of the dimensions we've already discussed, the regulatory dimension, the public benefit dimension, all of those things. And I'm glad for their involvement, but in the end it will require deeper focus on the actual customers and what they need.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>you highlighted earlier a mistake that people often approach the problem as if they were an airline. Can you elaborate on this a little bit and perhaps add a few other common mistakes that you see when operators are pitching\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>hospitals? Yeah, so, the top down approach, it touches on what we just discussed and that, and going back to your first question, what's something I disagree about this industry is that, well, one thing is that this is actually an aviation technology. It's not. it's closer to the ground robots than they are to aircraft in my opinion, in terms of how they operate and how they should be approached. But coming in and telling a healthcare system that we have this new fancy technology, call us when you need it is not going to be a productive approach. And ironically, it's because they need it more than you can potentially deliver it right now. they need to move stuff around frequently and unpredictably. So I guess what I'm saying is the approach has to sort of be get on the ground level with the healthcare providers. And when I say that, I mean the healthcare systems and the people designing healthcare services and the people delivering the healthcare services really provide them access to the technology right there at the point of care as deeply integrated and distributed within a healthcare system as you can. there should be like somebody, maybe Luka, you said before, just as little friction as possible between these people, like the nurses and the doctors and these drones, as is possible or feasible. I think that will mitigate a lot of the top down thinking, because it puts the user in the driver's seat. It delivers them access to a sort of more of a platform technology that they can then... I use the way they want to use it and I'm a believer that there will be sort of hidden and pent up and maybe induced demand for the technology based on personal experience and my healthcare system, but it's speculative and not exactly data driven.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so what does the ultimate product look like in your opinion? from a user perspective, should it be the same as walking up to that window in the wall, opening up that pneumatic tube, punching a code to... the pharmacy or whatever, should that be the same kind of interface, except that punch the code for a location that is 20 miles out and then somehow one of those, pneumatic tube branches go off into the drone and it flies away and it's that level\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>of abstraction of all the complexity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What does the product need to look like? And that obviously has implications of how easy it is to integrate and\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>scale, et cetera, et cetera. Yes. So yes, that's a great question. So yes, I would love all those things to happen. we even engaged AEC firms to look at this and they developed plans for us. We looked at putting on, A drone port on a roof of one of our hospitals, and then, finding a way to connect it to the pneumatic tube system directly, that, that's a big lift. That would require some, probably, robotics, and some transfer stations, and things like that. So, while that sounds great, yes, I would like it to be a tube station everywhere that somehow interfaces with the drones, which are now a part of the building. I mean, in its most perfect form, The drone system is like an HVAC system. It's just a part of the building. it's just, it's built into the infrastructure, and it's a little bit more flexible than that because it's accessible, and it's not literally built into the infrastructure, but it's integrated physically into the infrastructure. Now, I do think That is a significant lift, and that has significant impact on the economics, as you mentioned before, and the other trade off is the deeper you integrate into the physical space and building, the less flexible it could become, but the thing that is discounted, and then the final product, I think, will be Something that is populated in the consciousness of the people in the health care system. So even if you have to walk outside, I think people discount the human component. what we need is a system that is relatively accessible to our people on the ground. I should be able to, or our clinical nurses or medical assistants should be able to understand that if they have a lab sample that is given to them, the option now is either batch it with the courier or you have to call a courier stats. They need to understand that a third option is, or I could just walk it downstairs real quick and out in the parking lot, there's a little drone station that I can stick this thing on and then send it across with the user interface that I'm familiar with. that would be a very effective system. It's relatively lightweight in terms of integration. It's accessible, but it requires that final human component. I also think that... that will be critical. it's, in terms of getting the lab sample, the final meter, from the drone, wherever the drone is interfacing with the system, say, analogous to a tube station on a nursing unit, to where it needs to go. It's the people that work in the healthcare system and in the clinics who understand, have all the tacit knowledge, who understand where all this stuff needs to go. If you can just teach them very quickly and easily how they can access the system, I think that's the perfect answer. The perfect way to drive you use it. It doesn't have to be right next to them, but it has to be reasonably accessible and they have to know how to interface with the system. In other words, The user interface has to be very simple.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Stuart, who are the groups that are the most natural fit for figuring this out, figuring out how to integrate this technology into this type of an operational use case? Is it the hospital system itself that does this evaluation and integration and adoption? Or, I don't imagine that many of the drone operators are going to, take it all on themselves. Perhaps, one or two of the pioneers would, but is there a segment, that sits in the middle where there's a natural fit, where there are companies that do this as part of their business, or is this something that needs\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>to be filled?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a great question. So, healthcare systems as customers are notorious for having a hard time figuring out if they want to build or buy across multiple products and domains. I mean, virtual care services are a great example as they're trying to figure out how to deliver virtual care to patients. Some are buying off the shelf, and that's driving a new corner of the industry. And some are saying, you know, it makes more sense if we just build this ourself and do tech partnerships and sort of assemble versus build. I don't know, which will occur here. I do think the way that healthcare systems buy products and services, it will certainly be easier if that interface and integration is done with them, but through the delivery of technology, meaning I do think there is going to be space for companies whose job it is to come in and say, we're going to optimize your logistics and your transportation networks through this technology, and we're going to add drones as a component of that. I do think, from an economic standpoint, they will probably need to address more than just, we're going to add drones to your system. The hope is that Those companies in the middle may help optimize against the growing demand for provision of logistics and transportation services that I mentioned early on in this discussion. And so there may be ways they can provide a broader value proposition around transportation and logistics that includes drones as a component, but isn't only aimed at drones, if that makes sense. Another way to put that is drones alone are... attractive and valuable for all the reasons we've discussed, in my belief, for healthcare systems. But all the better if we're optimizing for a larger transportation and logistics need that is poorly provisioned currently. So I do think there may be space for that, to emerge, sort of integration platform providers that focus on things like B2B healthcare systems, to what extent that will be integrated into sort of what, you know, maybe there will be like you mentioned some drone companies or operators who decide that level of technology and service is necessary to satisfy their customers. it seems as likely that happens as it is that a third set of companies will come in and optimize for it. but, but I don't know. I do think that interface needs to exist.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm guessing there are rural healthcare systems that have a considerable cost of couriers and they are not reliable where they would say there's a great value once drones are at scale of plummeting my delivery costs and keeping my labs consistently busy, as you mentioned, that's one of the values that the lab would be busy throughout the day. I'm assuming that lowers costs as opposed to, I'm not quite sure why they just can't wait for the next day and evenly distributed throughout the day. But at the end of the day, my guess is there will be major rural health care systems that would say I may be able to reduce two to four percent of my costs with a reliable, less expensive drone delivery service. My guess is that's probably the low hanging fruit, Stuart. But I'm not sure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, I agree with you on that. and for instance, like you mentioned, why do they not mitigate their batching phenomenon? Well, those labs run 24 hours a day. The reason they don't do that is because there's another batch coming in. Like they just have not been able to, effectively do that. But I agree with you. I think that is the low hanging fruit. and it's a good place to start. It's also addressable from a standpoint of, modeling. I mean, maybe one of the issues here is, and you folks probably have a much better idea about the, what is emerging in the economics of drone operation and delivery, more broadly. But these companies don't know how much to charge, and they don't know how to price their service. They don't even know what their costs will be at scale, necessarily. they've never had to do that. It's just still very early is maybe the takeaway. I think that everybody's struggling to figure out exactly how the economics, like sort of a unit of economics will work for this kind of a delivery network based on this technology.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One thing that was mentioned by, one of our guests once was the potential of organ movement via drone, and I know weight is a big issue right now, but is there any sense of if only this could be moved by drone It would make a huge difference whether it be cost or a clinical\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a great question. I have an answer, that I have an opinion. it's people. And I want to qualify the use of the term drone. Drone, as we're discussing it now, probably implicitly means small fully automated vehicle that can carry small packages, 10 to 50 miles, but advanced air mobility. I think the tipping point is people. You can move expertise and you can move patients and they can carry cargo. But the transportation footprint for human beings, even on a non emergent basis, for healthcare system is much, much larger than most people think. As an example, my mid sized healthcare system, as already discussed, manages about over 20, 000 patient transfers per year. It's almost all regional within 50 miles. And the vast majority of that is not emergency or critical care. It is just inter facility transport of people. that is a large transportation footprint. and it's expensive and it's highly inefficient. and I think when we get to the point where we're able to move, if we're able to move people, so, so if drones or pneumatic tube systems and let's say eVTOLs are elevators, If we're able to do that, it doesn't have to be automated even, it can be piloted, but if we're able to do that and move people back and forth between, rural areas and, and health care facilities, for instance, then I think there's a giant impact on the way health care systems are configured. As an example, the entire trauma system in this country It's implicit in the way that trauma systems work is transportation provision, helicopters and ambulances, but it's not efficient, and it's very expensive. And essentially, we're willing to make those cost tradeoffs in their current form, because human lives are at stake but even for the more routine aspects of healthcare, I think when you can move people sized cargos or people themselves, that's a tipping point. Organs are great, but they're very specialized. It could be a very nice, addressable target for a company. but we're talking about... a very specialized group of hospitals, and in, in terms of scale and impact on health care, it's a tiny piece of health care, is organ transplant. So while I think it's very attractive to think about it, They'd help improve clinical care, changing outcomes for organ transplantation, which is by the way, all that any healthcare system cares about. They don't care if it's a drone. They would like to be able to provide the best transplant service they can. That requires large teams of surgeons to be moving around. That requires lots of infrastructure on the ground, clinical care, co operative and post operative services. The idea that you would move the needle clinically with a drone on that because you could move the organ faster is laughable to me. And I think that anybody who's seriously engaged on the ground with healthcare understands the complexity of that kind of work. And so it could be a very great way to generate, sort of pilot opportunities and have a lot of exposure. And yes, it would improve care, but is it going to move the needle on healthcare outcomes in the world of transplant? That's harder to imagine. So I think it needs to be aimed at less critical functions and more routine kinds of service where distance, is a factor, and where infrastructure is lacking. I think that's the great promise of this technology very broadly, drones, eVTOLs, all of it, is that it represents a new layer of configurable, flexible infrastructure that could be used to design and deliver services.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stuart, anything else that you'd like to, perhaps mention or summarize the conversation with?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't think so.
