It has some disadvantages, but I think staying too much time at the offices and drilling too deep into remote scenarios in your risk assessment, it sometimes gets not very effective, and I would suggest to put a limit on that and go out to the field and get your feet wet, in not the most favorable environments. And this is where I come to Israel. I invite companies, first of all, to come see what's going on here. We have been very open and we invite everyone to come and witness with their own eyes, not Zoom, not video calls. Coming, meeting the companies, being in our control center, and then come fly because you're gonna hit that problems at one point or another. So start that early. Sure, you're taking a bit more risk that your drone might have a malfunction. But if you do it over an uninhabited area, then come on, start flying. Let's put up a USSP first in a remote area. Combine a couple of companies. Experiment. That's my main message. And the second one is come do it in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>2:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Hey, welcome again to\"The Vertical Space\" and,a,one of a kind conversation with Libby Bahat Head of Aerial Infrastructure Department of the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority. This discussion has layers of value to include what makes Israeli aerospace unique, which includes that it's one of the more threatened airspaces in the world. We also discuss the Israel National Drone Initiative. A very impressive program, how it started, who started it, which may surprise you the program itself and the results to date. We discussed costs and profitability of drone operations, and how costs may be different in Israel versus other parts of the world. Listen to Libby's 1, 10, 100 and how it relates to profitability. It's amazing to hear about the use of drones and the management of the airspace in light up the current war in Israel. And how Israel managed the use of drones in the first minutes and hours of the war. Simply amazing. We spent a fair amount of time discussing the different impressive evaluations that have taken place. And what parts of advanced air mobility may be at scale today as a result. And what elements of advanced air mobility Libby sees scaling in the coming years. And what do you think he's most impressed with with advanced air mobility today? The answer may surprise you. I'll give you a clue. Listen to one of our more recent podcasts for the answer. So many thanks to Libby for his entertaining and important conversation. And to our listeners we hope you enjoy our talk with Libby Bahat as you profitably innovate and The Vertical Space. Libby has been working in the Israeli CAA for the past 15 years as the Head of Aerial Infrastructure Department. Libby is a qualified ATC, an instrument flight procedure designer, a Lawyer, and he holds an American private pilot license. Within the Israeli CAA from 2020 Libby is also in charge of the UTM/ U-Space implementation within Israel. Libby, welcome to the Vertical Space Podcast. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Thank you. Thank you so much. It's an honor being here.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What do very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I wouldn't know where to start. as we're following the European regulation. the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority, was in a good position to have a choice, to which regulation do we want to follow? Do we want to make one completely from scratch on our own? We're not a part of EASA. We're not a part of Europe, of the EU. Obviously, we're not under the jurisdiction of the FAA. So, we were in a unique position. And we looked at a couple of sets of regulations. Obviously, the European set and the American set, when again, we're looking at the ATM part of, of UAS, of, UTM, Unmanned Traffic Management. Eventually we chose, the European set, the EASA set of rule regulation 664 and it's, all, its, cousins, 665, 666 and so on. And as you recall, the basic, architecture is referring to a couple of U-Space service providers. So, a USPACE, let's say, over a city or over an urban airspace, and then the unit that will manage the traffic will be the USSP, UAS Service Provider, and a USPACE Service Provider, and it is supposed to give four basic services, ATM, conformance monitoring, geo awareness. Flight Authorization Services. So, even with that basic architecture, we had many debates.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm going to interrupt real briefly, if I may. Thank you for that introduction. But what's controversial behind what you just said? What does somebody not agree with you on based on how you've started this process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the basic infrastructure of four major services, just as a first example, we had questions, whether traffic management, the fourth service, you might say the fourth, obligatory service, mandatory service. We were not sure, we're still not sure, I'm not sure that's why I'm having a lot of debates about it in Israel, is better than having conformance monitoring, which is considered not a mandatory service. So we have questions about which are the correct, the better, you might say, four basic services. That's one thing I'm in discussions, let's say, a disagreement is a strong word. The second thing is having multiple USSPs in one UAS airspace. Again, there are many people, I'm one of them, that thinks this is so far ahead, and this is not the way that the average city will develop. So I'm not really sure that everyone is focused on, in these projects, in the our initiative and in many other projects, that there should be multiple, uSpace service provider in every uSpace. I'm not sure this is the architecture that we'll see at least in the the next couple of years, maybe 10 years from now, for sure, five years from now. So, so that's the second thing. I'm, you could say in disagreement. A third example we can talk about is, who will enjoy UTM? Will it be the average citizen? Will I get, like everyone expects, their coffee and sushi and hamburger and pizza? I don't think so. And I started many conventions with a picture of the soup Nazi from Seinfeld that says, No soup for you. Because I don't think, based on the current business case and looking at the cost, that the average citizen will receive a delivery by a drone in the next couple of years. I think it'll take longer than that. I think the public as a whole, municipalities, Police, different government offices. They will be the main users, of course, emergency services and health. So the third thing I might say is that, I don't think the average citizen will enjoy it, in the next year or two. Fourth thing I thought about mentioning is the conspicuity devices. So, how do we integrate crewed traffic into, the U-Space? Which technology would we use as a conspicuity device? Europe is very focused on ADS- low, ADS B, many different kinds of, new technology. And again, I'm in a lot of conversations with our colleagues about using things that are more common. I know about the Israeli, GA industry. Aircrafts are very old and, I don't see people installing new technology new devices in there. So I think people will use what's already in there. For example, Mode S, and then enhancing the capabilities of Mode S. or, and again, these are things that, that came up. Cellular devices. So, using our cellular phone as a tracking, as a conspicuity device. So, this is just a short of four topics that I'm, I have difficult with,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's terrific. I have to first say, usually pulling this answer out of people is not easy, but you gave us four things that people disagree with you on. Let me ask you on one of them. We had a terrific podcast last week, with, Bobby Healy from MANNA. I came away,a real believer of the initial value of the drone delivery being the high volume, now with MANNA, profitable coffee delivery is kind of a foundational start, to home delivery. You may not disagree with that. What you may be saying, I just want you to give a little more detail here. A little more light. Are you saying that the emergency services, the police services and all are taking the first priority for a reason, having nothing to do with economics or capability or delivery or profitability? You're just saying that for whatever reason, with your experiences, you feel the emergency services and the police will take priority.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I have to make, two different views on what we're talking about when we're talking UTM and USPACE. To have a segregated area and deliver, a cheap item from point A to point B, that's not what I'm interested in. I'm interested in managing large scale operations, multiple companies over urban areas, with a nice and good competition, and how do we manage the traffic, how do we maintain the skies safe. I don't call having a segregated area around a mall or around Starbucks and serving a couple of villages around it. I know that's profitable and that's being done and the costs are much lower. But when everybody's fantasizing about the pictures from the Fifth Element of taxis flying one over the other in Manhattan, And, through large scale operation over big cities and UTM U-Space, that's what, where I'm saying, this is not coming very short. And, the costs are high, are very high, be behind every flight. We'll talk about it soon. We made around 25,000 flights during this. Israeli National Drone Initiative. We'll talk about it. The costs are very high behind every flight, there is an ARA, an Airspace Risk Assessment. There is talking to multiple, government authorities. It takes a lot of time, a lot of people, there are people that are maintaining and, taking care of the computers in the USSP systems constantly because there are still bugs. So behind every flight, there are a lot of people and it's simply very expensive.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, it will be interesting if you could share some of the numbers on these cost drivers, because again, referencing Bobby's, recent episode, he was very open book about the costs being, currently,$4.27 per delivery, trending down towards,$3 by the end of the year. And they're not flying in segregated airspace. They're flying in controlled airspace. And you have multiple, delivery operators who are now flying in the same airspace under the Mode C veil in Dallas Fort Worth, for example, with MANNA and WING just recently showing how they are, coordinating their own internal UTM systems, or actually they're using an external partner. But that reality that you describe is really happening already. And with MANNA doing it profitably, don't you see that this is an early use case. Isn't that enough evidence?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">First of all, I'm a regulator, I'm CAA. I don't have deep knowledge, of the exact budgets that every stage is taking. Yes, the Dallas and the WING and MANNA cooperation, first of all, is something new. We all remember that we've been talking about UTM U Space at least for four years now. And only now, in the last couple of months, we see something, profitable. To my knowledge, they are the only one in the world that actually reached some sort of, of commercial profitability. I don't know of anywhere else it happened. I was at the Air Force for many years. And there are many ways you can count, one hour of flight of an F 15. Is it just the fuel and oil you replace? Is it the time the pilot was, instructed and qualified? Is it the maintenance that's after, I don't know, a hundred flights? So, don't know if they counted in the cost that it took to do the airspace risk assessment and the cost that people invested, the time that people invested in talking to, Dallas, to Dallas Airport, to, insurers to municipality, to the public, so I'm looking at everything to have one of our demonstrations. We still probably do have one demo, let's say every two months. So we're taking over a city, bringing there, let's say, 10 companies, now they're a bit less, but 10 operators to operate in the same city. And before such a week, we have 10 people, at least, just from the government, from the initiative management, working on it, I think, two full weeks. And, so I don't know if you measured just the electricity it costs to, charge the battery. and I'd love to hear, how it was done.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, you should check out the episode because, not to belabor the point, but, they do have a fully loaded figure that includes, variable cost and depreciation of the airplane, et cetera. But, what are those numbers like for the companies that you are working with in Israel? How much is their cost per flight?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I don't have exact numbers, Sometimes it's a simulated delivery. So the drone is flying from point A to B, but without the actual ice cream, hamburger, sushi, but$50 a flight. this, cause it's doing the actual flight and, we take over, an airspace over a city and we have, let's say, six, five locations spreaded in the city and drones are flying from point A to point B. They're being given, a destination that we're picking in advance. Which is, I don't know, two, three, five kilometers away from their departure point, going to that location and coming back. So this is what we've been doing. We have other missions that are not only deliveries, so we have cooperation with municipality, with the park So we did cooperation with the train, with the post office, with during COVID 19 pandemic. with the health administration. So, we had many profiles.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We're going to talk in a minute about your introduction to the Israeli, National Drone Initiative, but before we do, I'm sure there are people would like to know what's unique about the Israeli airspace? And then we're going to ask you about the INDI and, what it is, why it is, and the results you've seen so far.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">so, Israel is pretty small. Israel, if you Google the distances, so we're 470 kilometers long and 135 kilometers wide at the widest point. So, it's a very small country. I think, again, the square kilometers is around the 22, 000 square kilometers. However, we do have one of the largest air forces, at least in Europe, so either, even though Germany or France or the UK are 10 times larger than Israel, we have pretty much the same air force. You can, so you can imagine 600 aircraft squeezing in one aerospace. So it's small to begin with, we have a very large air force. It's very active. They're training a lot. Every pilot, in the Air Force does at least one flight a day, sometimes two. So the airspace is constantly, occupied. So these are first two things. Of course, we do have a very active, general aviation community and helicopters and light sport aviation, gliders, balloons, UAVs. We'll talk about that, in more in a second. So it's a very congested airspace. other thing is even before the war, it was a pretty threatened airspace. Everyone is very much on alert constantly for hostile drones. You can, see now that we're dealing with tens of drones a day, right now during the war. But even before that, we saw at least one attempt per month, even at what you call so called peace time. So everyone, is really on high alert from hostile drones. Theoretically, I know every country says they are on very high alert from hostile drones, but I think again, the volume here is obviously, much higher, I think we have many authorities with actual capabilities to deal with a hostile drone. And you have to make sure there will not be misidentification between a hostile drone and a friendly drone. So again, that's a bit different, because I think in many other countries, not every policeman, but not every senior cop has the ability to actually take down a drone. And in Israel, it's much more common. So, so the actual ability to deal with the drones is different. The last thing that most of Israeli airspace of that small airspace is not civilian, is not controlled by civilian unit. Most of the airspace is controlled by a military unit. The airspace are shared. So air aircraft, civilian aircraft can use military airspace, but the units that are controlling, are Air Force units. And, I'm a controller at Reserve Service at one of those units. Uh, and this is something unique, but we learned to use this sometimes as an advantage. So to make a lemonade out, out of this lemon, there are things that, civilian ATC, are pretty reluctant to do. and that's different with military ATC. So we take the advantage of each situation. So, so that's what's unique about the Israeli air space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So tell us a little bit about the, INDI background, use cases, participants, results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, around four years ago at the beginning of 2020, we were approached by, to our surprise, our highway authority. So, Ayalon, Highway Company, it's the equivalent of the highway authority and by, the innovation, authority they approached us, and we very soon, we set up a meeting with our director general. And basically, what they said, listen, us, the highway authority, have a mission to make the roads as clear as possible, to make the traffic flow. And we want to look at the possibility of removing small trucks and, scooters and making the roads a bit clearer and safer. Our innovation authority said we have the budgets, it's innovation, it's high tech. We have a budget. We want to start with a big initiative. We want to experiment, we want to try, we want to get our feet wet. Have companies fly over urban areas, let's say Tel Aviv and we will learn from this experience. You, the regulator will learn, which are the laws that, that you should do, which regulations you should change. Everyone would benefit. And to everyone's surprise, you can say, our Director General gave the thumbs up, and says, I'm good with that, Ayalon Highway Authority. You may take the lead. You have my green light. You have my people. That's me and my colleagues, Ami and Liron. Please help them with whatever they need. So this is how it started. And the basic structure says that us, the three authorities set up a tender. And we say in a one month, there will be a USpace and a UAS airspace over Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, just name a city in Israel, we've done it in that city. So there's going to be an airspace that we're going to experiment with deliveries. So, let's say for the first demonstrations for the first two years, about 10 operators, 10 drone companies, applied. Every company was checked and double checked by the innovation authority to see it's a valid, good company. And, you should fly every day, 50 missions, 50 flights will give you on every morning where you have to fly to, and everyone has to be connected, obviously, with the control center. So one of the, the bullets of that tender was also applying for, uh, USSPs, companies that will run the aerospace. And, we have two companies in Israel that joined right from the start, Airwayz and High Lander there. And they remained until now. We didn't have a third company joining so far. And this is how the structure was built and after a month, and that continued for 25 times, a headquarter or a control center is being built in that city. Airways and Highlander are two USSP companies sit together, connect their computers, set up the DSS, we'll talk about it. The companies equipped their drones with remote ID and we start flying. This is the basic structure. Besides those dedicated demos, I think the European term I like using is VLD, Very Large Scale Demonstration. So other than those something VLDs, we also used some opportunities we had outside of these organized demos. So when COVID 19 meant a complete lockdown of movement, actually, in Israel, curfews and so on, though we offered our services to different hospitals and the Ministry of Health to deliver, covid, samples, and to deliver, something to a building that's isolated. But we can land our drone on top of the, on the roof of that building in that hospital, drop the supplies that the nurse required, and that would save a nurse to dress up, dress down. It takes about 15 minutes. So that's one, way we did during the COVID-19, when there was a security situation in Beersheba. And we needed to scan the roads, help assisting the police to track down a suspect. We used to have a crisis in construction site with people falling down because they didn't, harness themselves correctly or they're doing their duties with no helmet. So we had a ad hoc cooperation, to see the, we can, control the safety in those sites. So, I can name a couple of other, corporations, but, the basic structure is the VLD and then jumping on different, opportunities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So Libby, I'm curious to understand a little bit more one of the first things that you mentioned, where your views, diverge from the rest of the industry, flight management versus conformance monitoring. Do you mind exploring that, thesis a little bit in more detail, including, arguments in favor of each.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, the four services that are mandatory according to, the European regulation, are four, they are network id, geo awareness, flight authorization. And the last one is traffic information. And this is, something that we dealt with, during the beginning of the war. I'm taking you to October 8th, okay? Or let's say October, 7th, noon, when everyone knows Israel is under attack. And we know that the war started with drones being sent from Gaza towards Israel, and there was a very big fear that, hostile drones are still, within Israeli airspace. Very soon, we pushed the 9/11 button. Everyone on the ground now, after a couple of, minutes, all the villages and all the, security managers of cities, of remote villages, of settlements, called us and say, listen, we have to fly our drones because this is the way we take care of the perimeter. We patrol the fence. So, you have to withdraw this restriction. So we have, and again, it's not only a fear from drones, it's a fear from terrorists that penetrated Israel. Eventually, what happened, and I'm cutting a long story short, we can get to that later if you wish, is that we declared the entire Israeli FIR as a demo or a semi U-space. That every settlement was allowed to fly in its own territory, only if they're connected to the USSP. Very fast, we, we built the control center. Have Airwayz and Highlander, our two USSPs, sit together, and we gave the possibility for each settlement to connect to either one of them, just as, theoretically you would, the European regulations sees that could happen eventually in a city. And it became clear to us that we are giving, actually four services, but not the ones that the regulation is referring to. So we're giving a network ID, obviously, no one was allowed to take off without, a network ID. The companies were giving these, operators geo awareness service. Before they would fly, they would file a flight authorization request. But, there was no need to, for traffic information service. There was a need, however, because everyone was flying within his own settlement. And many of these flights was anyway VLOS, because these were the guards having their drones within line of sight, doing their line in their territory. It doesn't have to be the full settlement, but their part that they were responsible in that fence. But it was very important to have a conformance monitoring because we wanted to make sure that if these were, on the border of being amateurs, these were not professionals, again, guards and volunteers for every settlement, for every village, including from my kibbutz where I live. Volunteer told the management here, listen, we have a drone we have good camera capability. I can guard this part of the fence from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM So many people volunteered and we wanted, it was very important for us to give them some sort of an alarm if they're doing something you're not supposed to do.. If they're getting away from the area that they are, they're allowed to operate. So conformance monitoring was very important. Traffic information was not so important. Now, when I try again to learn from this experience, and this is, getting close to what I was talking to in the first part of where people disagree with me, I think the average development of a shopping mall with one company serving the villages around him will happen much faster than 10 operators over Tel Aviv, a couple of, USSPs will give their traffic services. I don't think we'll reach that amount of traffic that will, it will make it profitable for everyone. I think we'll start in many places with one company giving services to the areas around it. And the services that are important are the ones I mentioned. The traffic information service is for a later stage. Even that, again, I'm in a couple of teams in Eurocontrol, in EASA. Including the ones, Andrew is so active at, and the way that traffic information service will be giving is questionable. Theoretically, the operator should get an information about a drone that is approaching him that is, not monitored or, a man crewed vehicle or, under the the, dynamic crewed, traffic. He's supposed to, take care of that. He's supposed to land, move his drone. There are many questions on how it'll be actually implemented and, I think it's a very good. philosophical or not discussion, but this is some part I'm, first of all, I'm imagining the development, the chronological development, as a certain direction. I might have it all wrong, but assuming this is the way evolution will go, I think the weight on each services will get clearer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's an interesting observation. And one thing that comes to mind is, if you're suggesting that there will be one operator per region serving a certain amount of airspace and the people underneath them, it becomes very difficult to then, arbitrate who will be that one provider in that area, right? Obviously as a government, you cannot say, no, we already have one operator in this area, so nobody else can come close in a way you're then promoting a monopoly in that particular area. So I don't think that's the way to go either. So at some point, the market forces will drive operators into a certain area. And now the problem is, okay, let's say that we have more than one, does that create the need for traffic information service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>32:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. Definitely. I wish, and I truly hope that I'm wrong and that I would get a request from four companies or even two to start deliveries in Tel Aviv. And then I would say, okay, guys, how do you, manage the separation? So I really hope I'm wrong, but until that situation comes, I think we will see more and more situation when we have, deliveries by one company because no one else wants, you're very right. I truly wish that I will get a request just as we start with multiple operators to operate in a certain airspace. However, since I know the costs right now, at least in Israel, are very expensive and the service will be very expensive, I'm not sure it will happen. I was starting to say that I'm looking at many problems in my life, in aviation, let's say, from history. And I'm looking about, how expensive services and new technology started. And I'm looking at the helicopter, taxi services in New York. And when I was a kid, I looked at the helicopter and my dad told me, oh, this is so expensive. When you're old, it'll be cheap. It'll be a 10 helicopter. It didn't happen. so I hope this will happen much faster, but for now on, since this services are expensive, I don't see a very large market and so many customers, so I hope I'm wrong, but that's why I think we won't start off right from the beginning with multiple operators because of these costs. When the first company arrives, starts delivery, as soon as the second company arrives, that'll be a good point to tell, okay, and, and we can set that off from the first contract with the first company. Okay, guys, you knew this is gonna come. I told you that when another operator comes, you will have to find a solution for safety, and you will have to have someone to manage the airspace. Guess what? As the Europeans like to say it, an acceptable means of compliance would be a USSP. By the way, do we need at that point two USSPs? Maybe we need just one company to manage the airspace. So I'm talking about scalability and costs. I have a good fault in that we've been working very hard in Israel on how to, and I'm going to get to that right with that question. What are the bottlenecks? So we've been working extremely hard in Israel on making this work. So making two USSPs cooperate perfectly, having no bugs, having restricted areas going back and forth. Having the flight authorizations, whatever is needed, and, it is very hard. And now, or let's say, as I, you could say, grew up a little bit and learned the costs, I'm thinking we might have made a mistake and we might have focused not on the most important and urgent thing. We've been focusing very hard on making a couple of USSPs work together perfectly in a U-Space. And what I'm telling you now, how sometimes I view things, it doesn't correlate with that knowledge now. But I was the first one to promote working on cooperation between a couple of USSPs. And that brings me to a question. Having two USSPs, or three, or fifty, working together is extremely hard. It's extremely hard because of emotions that competitors have, and, you can, assume a perfect utopic world, but we're talking about people. And when two companies have to work together the atmosphere has to be good. And when it's bad, and he's not working according to criteria, no, that guy's not working according to criteria. And unlike other topics that I'm in charge of in the CAA, I'm not a coding expert, and I don't know all the algorithms on the ATSM by heart. And, so, so that is a major, bottleneck, having two companies cooperate, so that's one stage. And then there's the actual technical difficulties. There are hundreds of commands and hundreds of orders and code is switching from one place to another. And hundreds of questions arise. And to some of them, I would say even many of them, there is no one answer. And, we had to answer many questions. And, this was the second and third, bottlenecks. The actual technical difficulties of running such a complicated mission. And the third one is the criteria that is not yet existing. So these are three, bottlenecks, I would state that these are going to be a big headache for me when we start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so is it fair to say that most of the challenges are, a step beyond simply assembling the information of the traffic picture across the different operators, but the challenges are really in using that information, how to coordinate the flight operations and keep them deconflicted when you're dealing with competing operators. Is that what you're saying?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think so, and this is just looking internally. So having two companies cooperate. Having, two companies, both software, you could say, working, that's the, second issue. Answering questions that are not, or getting answers that are not in criteria, that'll be the third. and we haven't even started talking about, different issues that are coming from outside. So, police, so Air Force, and many other government authorities want to have a say and want to make you do something for their needs. So, just looking at the internal difficulties, these are the major problems I stated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The National Drone Initiative has been ongoing for a few years now. What are some of the biggest insights that came out of it? And I'm curious, how come after so many years, there is no regular commercial operations of drones.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">On a private or commercial area for one single company, we have a lot of drone activity. Drones have been flying in Israel for more than 50 years. I was working on the first AIP chapter that incorporated them into the Israeli airspace 15 years ago. The first AIP chapter, on routes corridors and training zones was published in Israeli AIP in 2010. So we have around 300 companies registered, 300 operators, and around I think 3,500 drones have a registration number, meaning they're doing commercial activity. It sounds, doesn't sound like a lot, but if you look at Israeli size, that we are only less than 10 million people. If you look at the scale, it's pretty okay. So a lot of companies are having very successful commercial activity in the drone industry. So we're looking at agriculture and we're looking at photography and different IR scans and security. You name it. I think Israel is pretty known for being rather advanced. And there are many, companies that are working very successfully. We think generally, we're looking at, uh, a formula that says 1, 10, 100. So one operator operating 10 drones doing 100 missions a day. We generally say, as a very generalized, formula, when we were at that point, then we can be profitable. If we have one guy operating one drone, again, we might have get, got the math wrong, but we don't think this is, profitable again for the average citizen. So that's why the main, areas that it is worthwhile is the areas that, that I mentioned that are for public. I don't like, you can say the police example, cause, cause that's a wholly, a totally different, ballgame. That's first responders, that's emergency, let's say getting a defibrillator, serum, and they have, again, looking at manned, crewed traffic, this has been like this for ages and there will be no difference in drones, if a police helicopter used to have priority, then the police drone will have priority, and the same goes for medical operations.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you see the same concept of separation minimums of the traffic for drones that we already have with helicopters and other aircraft operating in the airspace? Will they be kept apart by the same distance? Do you see it as being something different for drones and, what is the capacity of the airspace for these different drones to operate alongside each other based on that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we started off, with a very basic, number, you could say, before the initiative, the basic number for, BVLOS separations was a separation of, five miles from IFR flight 2000 feet. And from, in Israel we have what we call controlled VFR route, or in short term CVFR, controlled VFR, and from VFR routes we allowed five kilometers but still, 2000 feet. That's, with the very basic certification process and before, dedicated the risk assessment. So, this is how we started the initiative after, when we started with the first demos we knew each company went a very detailed certification process and testing of their specific drones. So after we did that process, then the basic separation, got down to 500 feet. And, it was still, five kilometers, but 500 feet, vertical separation from, VFR traffic and man, the crewed, VFR traffic. And this was, fair enough for the, these, demos by the way, between the drones themselves within a U-Space we experimented with 60 meters between one drone and another. The initial altitude for the, U-Space was, 400 feet. That was the initial, number and that's around 120 meters, so we thought, again, looking at the traffic volume, we actually need to have two drones passing at the same second one over the other. So we experiment a little bit with, two actual, levels. So one drone flying at 60 meters, the, the other at 120 meter, again, very soon we realize it's working. We have to work a lot and very hard and the cost of having one drone do 360 or hold for 15 seconds and letting the other one pass, it's just so much simpler, and the traffic volume doesn't really justify getting into all that very hard work. I do see a very, big difference from manned traffic and that eventually every drone, the USSP, that unit would know its specific characteristics. So if I know that the regulator authorized for Matrice 300 for a specific type of drone, that we know that it was proven to us the accuracy levels are 60 meters by 60 meters, and another drone is less accurate. The other drone is cheaper, and that's, we could prove, or someone could have proved to us, that drone's accuracy level is 100 by 100, then the USSP systems would be able to tailor a separation for each drone. And it's a very big issue if I was a controller and I would known 737 800s have this level of accuracy, Airbus 320 have that level of accuracy and so on and so forth. But when a computer is running the thing, then I have no big issue of having a tailor separation between each two sets of drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And if you get down to, 60 meters by 60 meters type of separation, even in work you're doing today, and that still strikes me as a high number, but even if you stay there versus what you might achieve in the coming years, to me that seems like that would minimize the impact on the other drones that are operating in the airspace is type of separation would leave a lot of capacity, in the airspace system for drones. Is that the right read, on this or do you see it a different way?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I see it, the same way exactly. I was at a webinar or, it was even, a, of a conference that I think the Spanish authorities, I believe, were investigating a much lower number. Just as you said, I don't think it's a realistic, number. the second issue I was coming to is the reference altitude. The how do we, make sure that the drone that took off from one place but lands on the other has the same reference altitude as a third drone that took off from a totally different place? And that's another thing that you could say is you, it's not only unique to Israel now, but GSS interferences. So GSS interferences are a big thing in Israel. I know not only in Israel, now entire Central Eastern Europe and many other areas. Unfortunately, conflicts are not only in Israel right now. When you take everything into account, I think 60 meters as just, as you said, is it, is an ambitious number to begin with, I'm not sure how quickly it will be absolutely necessary, and I if I have a better solution of separating traffic, if it means one drone will, slow down for 30 seconds, I prefer the easy and simple solution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As I understand the operations that you have trialed so far are mostly VLOS, correct?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, I would say, something between, a third or even a half were BVLOS.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What's involved in obtaining approvals to fly BVLOS?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm not in the, airworthiness department, so I'll have to have a assistant from my colleague, Ami, from, airworthiness and engineering. But again, it's not something, new, of course, beyond visual line of sight operations have been in Israel for many years. And it's not something new. I could say just one thing without getting into the technical specification of what it takes to take a BVLOS. First of all, it doesn't require detect and avoid. So, drones that were manufactured, Hermes 450, for example, they're manufactured in a factory next to, uh, which is in the north part of Israel. And then those, had to fly to test their engines to instruct a foreign, customer, their BVLOS. obviously, they're flying, in an unsegregated airspace with other traffic, but without detect and avoid. The second thing is that we required a very well trained operator that's very well, knowledgeable in IFR flights, in, different malfunctions, obviously communication problem, navigation problem, just almost as an IFR pilot. And I know we were approached many times being told, Hey guys, what's needed to fly a Hermes 450 from the north of Israel to the south part of Israel is different than what it takes to fly a Matrice 300 or an Autel, over the margins of Tel Aviv over a large central park. So, these are a couple of requirements.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, so IFR expertise is not really a factor if you want to fly a small UAS up and down the coast beyond visual line of sight. So, is the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority using a SORA like framework to try to assess air risk and ground risk and then based on that assigns a SAIL level and later approvals for operators. Would you describe that process as very much similar to a European process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, it does. Again, not in my department, it's Aerial Infrastructure Engineering. I get to the part of that assessment that involves the aerial infrastructure. Again, this has been going on, for more than 10 years in Israel, you might even say, 50 years in Israel, and I get, into the picture when we're looking at the aerial infrastructure. Do we get next to an ILS and next to a SID from Ben Gurion? From a VFR route, what we call the controlled VFR training zone, and so on and so forth. But generally, yes, we didn't invent anything new. We're following a European regulation. I think we have some combination with the FAA regulation. I know for sure with licensing, we're following part 107. And I think historically the Civil Aviation Authority was very well connected 15 years ago, much more to FAA regulations. And we have a couple of relics from that period, like licensing, but, we're following either European or FAA regulation very strictly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I see. And I'm curious about your comment about not requiring detect and avoid for some of these larger UAS BVLOS flights. Is that because the entire airspace is so very tightly controlled that, there's less emphasis on detect and avoid.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, that's because all the airspace is controlled by a military controllers that have, very good sometimes too, strict control on every vehicle, on every aircraft. That's why we don't rely on the eyes of, of the operator. We don't need the eyes of an operator on the vehicle itself. They do not share the airspace with VFR. So in VFR traffic, theoretically, there is no such thing as separation and as instructions of ATC, but we rely on visual flight rules. So I won't get a drone in those routes. I usually I rely on both pilots. Either one of them will have to see the other traffic. Even if one is delayed, the other one will catch it first.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So general aviation VFR flights can only happen in certain corridors in Israel?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">When it's a bit complicated, if it's unplanned and you just want to hop on your Cessna and take off, to train a little bit, then you can do it, yes, only on certain corridors and on certain training areas, normally close to the, the airports on weekdays. Weekends, it's a bit different. There's much more freedom for the civilian low aviation to go about, wherever they want. And even during weekdays, they always have the possibility to request a special, request. they ask these, they file these requests and hundreds a day, to do this or that activity. Sometimes it's authorized, sometimes it's not. Mainly because. the airspace is packed with the Air Force training or doing operational missions. So, it's kind of a special situation in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just out of curiosity, at what altitude does controlled airspace start?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's basically you could say from zero to 5, 000 feet, but looking at very basically, there are some sections it'll go to 10, 000 feet and some that'll go below 500 feet. And even, it's a topic for another podcast. Even the way the controllers are controlling VFR traffic is almost close to IFR. They are giving them very strict instructions and separation, and they are very worried if two Cessnas come in a converging junction. But 5, 000 feet is a fairly good number.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So considering all of these factors, airspace and otherwise, is Israel an attractive region for drone operators from other countries to come in and do business? How often does that happen?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, we started the initiative, and I think we got a little bit famous around the world just a couple of years ago, let's say three to two years ago. And a year ago, nine months ago, the war started, just as before the initiative, getting a operator to fly in a country and not his own there's a paperwork involved. If I were to come with an Israeli company and start doing business in the U. S., It's not so simple. I think that again, Israel is a very attractive, or let's say should be a very attractive place for foreign companies to come because we took all these lemons and made them into a lemonade. So the fact that most areas are not controlled by civilian ATC means that we have, to do the coordinations with the Air Force and they apply very good logic, they are not obliged to look at some of the separation laws that the conventional, the historical, separation laws that came from a certain history in a certain context that is not relevant today. So we can execute to some extent logics that we cannot, demonstrate with civilian ATC units, unions, you name it. Now, the second thing is that again, I think we, the Civil Aviation Authority, have demonstrated that we are pretty flexible and that we are very helpful, that we are very approachable. You don't have to take my word for it. You can ask people from the industry, but me, Ami from Airworthiness, Liron that works with me, the SWAT team that was established to take care of UTM U-space. We are really doing our best, and sometimes an operator, it's very important for them. They might give up some profits, they might look at different problems they have getting a responsive and active regulator is a very big bonus. Now, the last thing is that I think, like the famous song, if you made it in Manhattan, you can make it anywhere. Well, if you've flown in Israel, no one can tell you that, you can't cooperate with authorities. No one will tell you that you cannot fly in places that have a hostile drone threat. And no one can tell you, ah, you, you probably can't fly in congested airspace.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I like your analogy. If you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere, right? But you're not at scale, though. So even though people are operating in Israel, and you can say, well, if you could do it here, you could do it anywhere. But nothing's really at scale. Or am I missing something?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think, having, around 25, 000 flights, let's say half or third of them in BVLOS in four years, in 25 very large scale demonstrations over people, over, the most major cities in Israel, over Jerusalem, the most sensitive place on Earth. With the size of the Israeli airspace, I'd say we're at scale. I didn't hear of any other country that ran a demo or a project with 25, 000 flights. It's true that the market. in Israel has its limitations. We're 10 million people. Let's say the more, more attractive parts of Israel with the major, customers, that is the big cities, the major urban, areas. Let's say our half of it, so we're looking at 5, 4, 3 million people. And that's true. The market is not very large. I think we have our advantages. someone can grab the opportunity and if our advantages are exactly fit that this or that company that can make good use of it I think they will be very unique So again, I think our attractiveness is true. It's not size and the market, but it's the other considerations of, and other special factors in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, on a few different, dimensions, you've mentioned the impact of military drone operations in the airspace and how that shapes the scale up of commercial operations. Looking at what you've seen in the Israeli airspace relative to this, and then also what we're seeing from the growing use of drone operations in wars like Ukraine. And if we project ahead to the future, what do you see as the implications of all of that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We had, this question being slapped on our face on October 7th, and we had to answer it right away. So we had about 24 hours to understand that we are in a highly threatened, new state of Israel, a new situation, yet we also knew in order to save lives, we have to allow friendly drones to fly. So that question was thrown in our face pretty aggressively on October, 7th. And right away. By the way, it went, we made an emergency regulation. We went to the parliament. Our two, units, our two USSPs were licensed according to Israeli law. So it wasn't, something that, that went on, without thinking it went through the entire, legal process in Israel. And basically what we did right away is mandate a remote ID to every small drone that's taking off. We mandated, that either company, that the entire Israeli airspace would be covered by companies that knew that's their responsibility and that they would pick up any RID Signal that that shoots up in that airspace. By the way, we contacted very fast DJI to open up their, RID broadcast services and they did it pretty fast. They understood the situation. So basically every drone that people are buying right now is transmitting, broadcast, RID right now. So, so these are a couple of, the solutions we found right away. I can say, from my experience, also in my, as, as my, with my reserve hat on, even the way that the Israel has dealt with the drone issues, even within Israel is very different. You hear about a couple of drones a week entering the northern part of Israel But although there have been a hundreds and hundreds of attempts from Yemen and from Iraq to send drone to the south part of Israel, no one succeeded. I don't want to get too much military here but even within israel, there are parts that the solutions that were there work much better. And obviously there are places where the solutions are much harder. There's no one solution. And we will have to build on many small solutions and try to make an impact.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, you've gone through many successful years with the INDI. You've learned a lot. Three years from now, you have a couple of parts of the advanced air mobility structure at scale. What's going to be at scale and why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I, I'm in a bit of a disagreement with my colleagues, as you heard. I wish that I would have, in three years from now, At least two USSPs in all the cities of Israel. I hope the bigger ones, obviously more customers, more people will enjoy more to the public, all these USSPs will be coordinated with the different defense organizations in Israel. So the Air Force, the police, other security organizations will have that. Picture so every police officer could have two swipes on his iPad and see if the drone above his head in the middle of Tel Aviv is a friendly one or he should take it down. and that goes, to the unit, to the Air Force unit. I know we're focusing for very good reason on urban airspaces and how do we provide the services in urban airspaces, but I want cities to be connected. We've been having a lot of flights between U-Spaces, long distances. Vehicles with the eVTOL, you just have to have a wing and it's, and you can call it eVTOL, another multirotor. So, larger vehicles. We've had, the EHang vehicle, both the 216 the passenger version and the cargo version flying in Israel. So I would want to have, some sort of taxi service. It won't be cheap. that's what I think, But I'd want that to happen.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But that's unlikely to be at scale in a couple of years. Clearly what you're describing with the drones, for the police forces, for the security forces, that it's seamless, that probably will be at scale is what we're hearing. And I'm guessing there will be some kind of drone delivery services, whether it be for, coffee, hamburgers, or medical delivery. It sounds like that may be at scale based on the excellent lessons learned. My guess is a little bit from what I'm hearing, passenger carrying vehicles, probably not at high volume scale, right? In three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I absolutely agree. We have, stations outside the city, you can park your car and take a bus. So if I can for 10 kilometers, even less so, if, if I can have a, EHang for$100 a flight doing this, seven minute flight the next central station in that city, I'd be very happy. Just as you said, I think the operations that will be of scale are those that have some sort of public value. So, I think municipalities will be a good place. Heavily using drones. I think government offices, environmental, looking for, construction garbage that, that, truck drivers throwing their, the dump from their trucks at illegal places. So I think, a general public, usage will be, at scale. I know we've been in contact with many offices and municipalities, court authorities, of course, the health industry. So I think in three years from now for that, I can, I'm pretty positive, unlike what I said at the beginning, that there will be a very long time before I'll get my sushi with a drone. I think it's different with public use, and that I can bet.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I do want you to give two minutes to the USSP providers out there. Let's say governments who are going to be deploying the USSP's and service providers, commercial organizations that are part of this process. What advice would you give to people? It's not, you have a lot of practical experience with really complex airspaces. What advice would you give to countries or providers for USSPs?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The first advice is having a very good knowledge in aviation and in regulation. We had high tech companies, very smart people, but without previous knowledge in aviation, they're having a very hard time understanding the logic. Look, I have a perfect solution. Yes, it's not STM, mine is better. No, you don't get the picture of the way things work. So, so this is, one advice. The second, that's more for countries and organizations. Don't do anything alone. Get cooperation for, I would say, the ideal number is three to four organizations. More is too much, and doing everything on your own is too little. So I would say join hands with other government agencies, other government offices, and don't do everything that one organization leads the entire thing. it's a, I don't know, it's an obvious advice, but you have to get people that are really into it, that really love it. You have to find that guy in the right organization, in the air navigation service provider, in Regulator and have that SWAT team being set up. Be sure that these guys get the authorities, get the approvals, get backed up from their managers. that's true in, in, in many issues. You have to get the right people really enthusiastic about it. And again, having, personal, connection with everyone on board. So meeting a lot, understanding the other guy's problem, not making decisions on your own. For sure you don't understand the full picture of your partner. And you have to have ongoing, very good, relationship, personal, and only then you will get to a much more educated, decision and it will save you time, in the future for granted funding goes without saying again for every problem in the world. And get the regulator on board and making sure that he's giving some sort of flexibility and that he has the ability and the will to help you. If a regulator wants to help you, they have ways. Every regulator has its ways, so you just have to get him on board. These are the top advices for people just starting a national drone initiative.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">When you look around the world and you see drone operations, being conducted, where are you most impressed?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right now, Dallas. Obviously, Dallas is very impressive because that's commercial. We've seen a lot of activity around the world, But Dallas would be the first. I hear a lot, I think I hear most of the things that's going on in Europe, but from now on, I have to say, if you're looking at actual flights and actual activity, it's low scale I'm, again, I have the pride to say we've done a lot of activity in Israel, I didn't see anyone get near that. Ireland, a lot of good things are going on in Ireland, thing that's really impressive in Europe is the regulation, the way they do regulation. We're very good, you could say, at practical experience. We, we hear of an idea and we run away and fly it. We want to experiment, to play with it, with our feet wet. That's one approach. The Europeans, I think, have a different, more strict approach, looking at the problem from one hand to the other, back and forth. And for me, with another approach, it's impressive to see the way they work. Very organized, very structured. And I'm impressed from that part in Europe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But the at scale operations in Dallas is a standout for you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, definitely,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What would you like to leave with our listeners? You've done a lot of years of very effective initiative here. What would you like to leave with our listeners that you think is unique based on your experiences?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think that you should get your feet wet. I think that the main advice I have. Maybe that's because it's a kind of an Israeli approach. It has some disadvantages, but I think staying too much time at the offices and drilling too deep into a third class, and remote scenarios in your risk assessment, it sometimes gets, not very effective, and I would suggest to put a limit on that and go out to the field and get your feet wet, get your feet wet, in not in the most, favorable environments. And this is where I come to Israel. I invite companies, first of all, to come see what's going on here without, without coming with your drones yet. But I do invite countries to learn from others experience. We have been very open and we invite everyone to come and witness with their own eyes, not the Zoom, not video calls, coming, meeting the companies, being in our, a control center, and then come fly, and because you're gonna hit that problems at one point or another. So start that early. I think the risk assessment can support that. Sure, you're taking a bit more risk that your drone might have a malfunction. But if you do it over an uninhabited area, then come on, start flying. Let's put up a USSP first in a remote area. Combine a couple of companies. experiment. that's my main, message. And the second one is come do it in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:10:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, great.

The viability of it has been proven very clearly. That this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think there has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space podcast and our conversation with Bobby Healy, CEO and Founder of Manna Drone Delivery. Bobby was a standout guest when we had him on the podcast back in March of 22, and we're delighted he could join us for a return visit today. Returning guests, give us such a cool perspective. They provide an update on the original assumptions and actual outcomes of the last two years. And with Bobby drone delivery overall, and more specifically Manna Drone Delivery, he reminds us of the original assumptions, what has actually occurred and what's been pleasant and disappointing surprises and how he sees the future and perhaps differently than his original assumptions. For those of who know Bobby and listen to his original conversation, you know he's a compelling, articulate industry veteran and accomplished aviation business professional. He's both a person who understands the technology and its application, and combines this with decades of aviation knowledge. And highly successful aviation technology implementation. This isn't always the case with some of the innovators and leaders in advanced air mobility. And it's perhaps one of the reasons more our app to bet on Bobby's projects and his vision for the future. And as we do with all guests, we listened to their important messages and we politely challenge their core underlying assumptions. And we've done the same with Bobby. Listen to what Bobby says is the killer app for drone delivery. Do you agree? He provides details with market size and price, which is refreshing. He talks about the value of B2C versus B2B in drone delivery. This in itself would make for a good podcast discussion as a lot of companies are focusing on B2B delivery. One of Bobby's essential messages is that the economics have now been proven for this space. Listen to his discussion of business and operational profitability. As we all know, getting to profitability is a challenge for any business. And it has been particularly challenging for some in advanced air mobility. Listen to how we discusses how Manna wants to power big and small brands directly. As an example, he has a deal with Coca Cola, where he flies their products. He discusses how he simply wants to replace the road and that consumers will and should never go back to road based delivery. If you listen carefully, you'll hear why Bobby has been more successful than others. I was a bit surprised by technology is actually deploying in house versus what others would hope he would purchase from outside technology providers. And finally listen to where Bobby believes advanced air mobility investments should be made beyond drone delivery. His answers may or may not surprise you. So many, thanks to Bobby for rejoining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our talk with Bobby Healy as you innovate and generate profits in The Vertical Space. Bobby kicked off his career building video games for Nintendo. He then founded Eland technologies an airline technology company, which he sold 12 years later to SITA. He then built Car Trawler the world's largest mobility marketplace for airlines over 15 years and led two successful LBOs for the business. For the last four years he's been building Manna a\"Drone Delivery as a Service\" business, whose mission is to improve the world by making lightning fast, suburban deliveries, affordable green and safe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, welcome back to The Vertical Space. We first spoke in March of 2022 and so we thought it would be great to bring you back and talk about the drone delivery industry and what has changed there, as well as what has changed with Manna. A lot of things have changed. So time to debunk some myths.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And it's great to be here again, guys. I'm really looking forward to it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Perfect. As you know, we typically ask if there's something that few in the industry agree with you on, would you amend your original answer or something else that's on your mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">If you look at my LinkedIn, you'll see that argument or the main arguments play out. Most people assume, not people in our industry, but generally people think that the use case is critical products, medical, defibrillators, urgent, societally beneficial products, and they are great use cases for sure. But the economic reality is that coffee and takeaway food is the killer app for what we do. That's one thing that most people, they don't disagree, they're just uninformed. They haven't done the work or the research that we've done on where the market opportunity is. And then the second one kind of hand in hand with that is a lot of people believe again, incorrectly that the unit economics or the capital economics don't work right now that they will at some point in the future when some magical technology comes along to make them work. But that's where I find, I enjoy myself the most on LinkedIn answering some of the people that have, raised those questions because I mean, I have the data, we have the flights, we're operating with profitable economics now. And I do enjoy engaging with people on the many misconceptions that are in our industry. And thankfully, we've already debunked them, not in theory or research. We're actually flying the debunk, even today as we speak we're flying aircraft in Dublin that are running profitable unit economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I would add that even when we talk to industry insiders, there is a tendency to think that B2B delivery use cases will be the ones that scale first, or at least if you asked them a couple years ago. There was a general tendency to believe that urgent cargo, high value not necessarily high volume movement will be the one that gains traction initially, especially because of the, arguably easier safety case to build with predetermined points in the network, as opposed to ad hoc, don't really know where the next order will come up, low value, you know, how in the world can you make money, delivering coffee and meals, et cetera, et cetera. Yet, as we often discuss on the podcast, those use cases didn't really scale past POCs and pilots, globally, whereas the, B2C delivery, the kind that Manna is doing is really starting to show some interesting inflection.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I agree. In the end we're running an infrastructure and that infrastructure is an airline. It's a cargo airline. And just like any other airline, utilization is a key factor in the profitability of that airline. And every airline in the world talks about load factor or utilization in our world. And you don't get that with high priority, critical goods, the volume just isn't there. So there's no world where you can make, those critical medical type deliveries a very interesting business from a commercial standpoint. And the other thing is you don't learn anything by doing that. Other than building an aircraft, you don't really learn anything. The real learning in serving the space we serve is in being in the trenches doing five, six hundred, a thousand deliveries a day out of a small car park and getting a 30 second turnaround time and embedding that learning into the software, into the hardware and iterating through that. So unfortunately, and there's a number of great players in our space that are doing and have done a really good job, pioneering job, I would say in medical delivery, but it doesn't translate in any way whatsoever to suburban, backyard, high throughput delivery. it's just two totally different paradigms and two different things to optimize.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Some of the guests we've had on have sometimes mentioned coffee delivery in a trivial way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Disparaging way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. And so, so when, as you're saying, listen, it's a, is it a good start for you? Is it a good proving ground for you? But can you scale and meet your financial projections that you want to hit in the next three years, delivering coffee?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already, every single coffee delivery we do is profitable. So 100 percent of them now, like we used to be at the weekends because we'd have higher utilization and then, weekdays were less so, but now our volume has diluted the fixed cost per location so they are profitable. And the thing about coffee is there isn't a product as popular on the planet for adults on a daily basis that has the adoption rate and the frequency and the gross margin that works so well that where the benefits of flying in a straight line as we do underwrite the new mode of delivering these products. So in a world where there's no such thing really as coffee delivery and people are now, I mean, you know, Starbucks or Starbucks drive thru is an example of Starbucks mobile app, people are absolutely addicted to, I would say, high consumption patterns, high frequency purchasing coffee. So of course it's going to be the best product. But now you say, people do trivialize it. Yes, only because I think not from a business sense, they're not saying coffee isn't a great product, but they're really saying, I think, is using the airspace to deliver a coffee seems like a bad idea to me. That's really what they're saying without saying it. And that's the purpose of I think regulation and the standards like Part 108 or in our case, U-Space in Europe, standards that are scalable that do allow high throughput in that airspace below 500 feet. And when we look at the market size we estimate that today there's 5. 2 billion food deliveries a year from the top four aggregators annually growing at 15%. So think DoorDash Uber eats all the way down and that's with a constrained market where there's a labor shortage, there's labor costs, economics problems, and there's a quality issue. So, so therefore those 5. 2 billion orders, road based orders are coming from customers that want it come hell or high water. Even if it's a bad customer experience and it's expensive. And the U S customer is paying nearly a 60 percent premium on basket value to get that pizza delivered. And they're never happy with it, but look, 5. 2 billion orders. So that's the current market. Our estimate puts it at a 16 billion order market without even trying, if we can remove the road from the equation and use aircraft. So you tell me one industry where you have probably a hundred billion dollar market staring at you in the face that's untapped, where the technology has proven we've already got positive uni economics. And the only thing between us and that giant market, I guess there's a social acceptance thing. You can't go too fast, too quickly. There's some regulatory, things still to unlock. But if you side that up beside blood delivery or vaccine delivery or whatever, it just dwarfs that space. And we didn't want to take on something easy. We wanted to take on the most impactful, space and that is everyday goods to everyday people in every suburban house on the planet profitably. And we're at the start of that now.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The other thing that strikes me about the coffee and the last mile consumer delivery is that you have the opportunity for a very consistent operation in order to make deliveries into all those customers in the market. By and large, they're already accustomed to ordering things from their phone from the ground based delivery aggregators. And in contrast, when we went and looked into the B2B medical delivery space, at least in the developed world, the companies face a pretty involved enterprise integration and organizational integration for each customer or each segment of customers. How is that flight operation going to work? Who is going to have the authority to initiate a flight? All of it ends up being a pretty heavy front load, cost and integration and it's heterogeneous operations as the business grows. Whereas in this it seems you already have a foundation of educated consumers accustomed to receiving deliveries via phone operations and it lays the groundwork for a reasonable path to go and scale a company to go and address that market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and there's no, enterprise sales process or there's no finding a budget somewhere in some hospital or some company's budget to try and do this innovative new mode. Our customers are the ones that are drinking the coffee. And they're abundant and they're aware of us and it's viral and all of these tailwinds to what we're doing that don't exist in the enterprise market. And then the other thing is we, again, we look at different densities. So European population density is much higher than US population density in suburbs. So for example, in Europe, we use a lot of motorbikes to move blood around between hospital critical to beat the traffic and it's very hard to justify, you know, why would you spend a large infrastructure budget and drones when the motorbike network's already there, largely run by volunteers. it's just sometimes forcing technology into a place where technology doesn't belong. Now different in Africa or, you know, countries that don't have transport infrastructure anyway. And of course there, you're not providing drone delivery. You're providing transport infrastructure. But there's already solid transport modes in most modern economies that are not as good as drone delivery, but they're not far off. So your benefits are marginal. And then you're incurring, as you said rightly, all this overhead of cold chain of all the trail of every part of the process for that sample or whatever it is. And then of course, toxic substances. a lot of the products you might want to fly in medical areas are considered hazardous substances, so, chemotherapy drugs is a great use case, but you're into a whole other area of risk there. And we just said, look, there's parts of that prize that we're interested in and we also liked the fact that it's a critical need to deliver those products, but at the same time, it comes with just such difficult challenges on the economic side of things that from my view, it's always going to be a business that's subsidized by something. And that's, I think, why it succeeded so well in Africa to date. And I think honestly, it's going to be challenged in other markets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I may say something really quickly, we can move on from this. As it relates to medical delivery, and in clinical pathology versus anatomic pathology, so blood versus tissue, I think an argument could be made that there's high volume of both, and tissue pathology will have a much higher critical factor, and there'll be a lot of price behind that, because there's a sensitivity to it where that may be a good market. I think they're both relatively high volume, but one difference between a cup of coffee is that the economics may not play out unless there's a lot of volume in the delivery. They're not going to pay a lot for one piece of blood, and I think one thing we discovered, Luka and Peter, on one of our podcasts was what's the real value of getting it there a little bit faster when it's a 24 hour turn on the testing anyway? But my sense is that the, and Bobby, in hospitals, labs, there's a very large cost item set aside for courier.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's a big element for labs. So maybe that's a next stage for you if the economics play out, but that meets a lot of your criteria, conceivably clinical and anatomic pathology, maybe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. I mean, I'd love to be, I'm not sure I'll be proven wrong here. What I'm, I guess in the end, what I'm saying is if you're going to build an infrastructure then you underwrite the cost of an infrastructure with a viable business case, and then all the other applications can work on top of that. So if you're already in a city or a suburb or whatever it is, and you're flying trivial products, albeit you're making money doing it, why wouldn't you then deploy that for other use cases? It could be beer. It could be medicine, like you say, samples, all of these things. And we can pick products up as well as drop them off. And why wouldn't you deploy? Of course you would. But you don't start with that because you're always going to be building a business that needs to be subsidized by something. And again, it comes back to ambition and scale. And for us, the ambition is unlimited. And we say, what is the biggest use case that we can solve? And it is, no matter what you say. It's always going to be the suburban household and their needs. And that's going to be what will underwrite the infrastructure for any successful player in this space. It ain't going to be medical.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>19:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, you talk about the potential to expand the market from what 5. 2 billion deliveries per year today with the ground based aggregators to something much larger. When you look at the differences that drone delivery brings into the equation, whether it's speed or environmental advantages or a safety case or cost, what do you see as being the key drivers that are creating the behavior change that leads you to think that there's a 16 billion a year, delivery opportunity?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">There's existing numbers that show adoption rates of road based delivery between 4 and 5% around the world and they kind of point to a low take up rate and there's our own data as well. and there's different states. I think that the restaurants are a small business. Think the consumer at the end of it all. And you look at the different things that they think are important. And in the case of the restaurant, restaurants frequently, they just can't, they can't get delivery, right? It's just too expensive. They can't do it themselves. The aggregators that power them, the, DoorDashes and Ubers and so on, that power them and themselves are constrained with output as well, if it rains, if the weather's bad in any way, or if it's peak time, you just can't meet the demand peaks, with people, it just doesn't work. So the result is batching, where multiple orders are put in with one driver and therefore cold food or terrible quality food and unpredictable times. And that's reflected in the NPS or the ratings of all of the aggregators, which are on the floor, not because they're not great businesses. They are, but they're constrained by just a limited output that they have. So why are we different? Because we're point to point. our average flight time is just less than three minutes. Physics is on our side. And when you have that advantage, the outcome is look, it's literally as simple as the outcome is hot food or hot coffee or, and in good condition. And that is remarkably the most important thing. It isn't speed. It will speed kind of translates into quality, but also reliability and predictability, which is as important as quality. People are willing to wait 15 minutes or 20 minutes. They are willing so long as that's what it is. But with batching and traveling, the traveling salesman algorithm, there's no way to be sure about that. So, so the variability is very poor. And so the consumer is going to modify their behavior because of drone delivery and the advantages it has. And we already see that in something as simple as coffee delivery. And before we existed, there was no such thing as coffee delivery in suburbs. That nobody would be crazy enough to do that because you won't make any money but yet our basket value in our coffee shop is more than twice the the basket value of the average order in the coffee shop itself, because behavior, right? It's a household order. So it's 2. 3 beverages per basket. There's a bunch of pastries and so on and then the other stakeholder for us, as I said, the vendor, the small business, they're looking at this saying they're now able to reach a couple of hundred thousand up to half a million customers in their catchment area of less than a five minute flight. And they're saying this is massive for their business. So. That's another stakeholder. And then the final stakeholder for us is the aggregator itself. And we'd expect our business is going to be, we call it B2B. And what we mean by B2B is we just want to be a delivery company. So we want to power the aggregators. We want to power the big brands. We have a deal with Coca Cola where we fly their products, but we want to power all of the big and the small brands directly, simply replacing the road. And so you think about the aggregators and their numbers are public. The aggregators lose money on most of their orders in suburbs because of the time it takes to deliver them and the labor costs and the labor laws. So we know the benefits to them are actually simply unit economics. we can do a delivery for them cheaper than they can do it themselves quite simply, and still make a strong margin ourselves because of our operating economics. So there's different stakeholders, but it, and some of them, it's about economics and some of them it's about experience and quality, and some of it, it's about growing the market. And by the way, the five to 16 primarily comes from number one is actually just widening the addressable market. So you're going from where the aggregators really only want to do very dense areas and quite short trips to obviously optimize their costs. We can now do much longer trips and support much less population dense areas. So you're actually widening the market to those like 92 million detached single family homes in the USA. And similarly in Europe, there's these really fragmented towns, suburb cities that aren't that easy to address for the traditional mode. So it's a combination of just customer behavior, I think, and market addressability.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, you answered the question, but I was going to ask if there are categories of products that people just wouldn't consider ordering via ground based delivery because they just know it's going to take too long, like a latte or something. And are you seeing that people will order those products given their expectation that it will arrive faster via a drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, we survey them as well. And quite interesting. If you look at lots of publicly available data, the key categories for road based delivery are, in order, if I just pick one market, the UK, where there's great data. And it's quite similar in the USA as well, but there's the top one is pizza. And then it's, other products like Indian or Chinese and burgers and fries is like fourth or fifth in the list of, perishable prepared meals. But actually if you ask people what they want to eat, burgers and fries is the number one thing. So what's going on there is people already know that certain products just don't deliver well, they don't travel well, and anyone that's got a road based delivery of burgers and fries knows that after 20 minutes, it's just toxic. So, so therefore you can't reheat it either. So, so consumers know not to order these things. So in the existing road based data, there's a hidden demand that's there that's not satisfied. We know that already from ours. And our number one, outside of coffee, our second one is probably tied between burgers and fries and ice cream. And an ice cream is an interesting one because you don't need a lot of choice in ice cream, right? You just need a quality, well known brand or two for the customer. But ice cream is interesting because it's 168 hours of the week almost, it's almost flat by hour of day of week. And it's driven by family orders, right? These are orders that have an experience associated with them, like a party or watching a movie or things like that. And the alternative is getting your car for 35 or 40 minutes to get the ice cream if you don't happen to have it. So we do see people now starting to rely on us for certain categories like coffee and ice cream that they might've pre purchased a week at a time and stored it in their fridge before, and now they just don't care cause they can get it from us and then the really the alarm bells, I think in a good way that ring for us is that burgers and fries in terms of meals are number one category. And finally, I would say people are saying, finally, I can get French fries. It actually tastes like French fries and they arrive. And I know that sounds trivial, but it isn't. It's the flagship product of McDonald's, right? I mean, French fries. I started this business because I wanted a bag of French fries and we call them chips in Ireland. I joke about it, but I did. And it's one of those, highly sought after products that delivery just fails.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>27:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I mean, Uber is a great case study in how an addressable market can expand when you introduce a new capability or a new user experience. I don't have the data to back this up, but I'm just basing this on my own consumption patterns and those close to me, but I'd be comfortable saying that a lot of Uber users their budgets for taxi and black cars prior to Uber were not the same as their Uber budgets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And the amount of music people consume now, it's Spotify. there's things that consumers never would have told you they wanted until you gave it to them and then they're absolutely reliant on it. It's like air and we'll be the same. We already are in the towns we operate in. It's just, people are blown away by the fact that they can get our service but at the same time, they straight away adjust to it and they start to get angry with us if we're 60 seconds late it almost feels like for some of them. So, so, and that's a good thing. it really is the end of road based delivery. When you offer this service, consumers never going back to road based delivery. And I think that's not unexpected. Our job has been at the engineering level to make sure that no matter what the weather is, they wouldn't need to go back. So that means flying in minus 20 C plus 42 C, very strong winds, I think 35 mile an hour winds, things like that, rain, obviously snow. And if you don't do all of those things and really from an engineering point of view, harden the product, you don't have a business. There's no point being a drone delivery business for fair weather because the restaurants and the customers that you're powering, they'll just, they just, if you, if they can't trust that you're going to always be there, you're a novelty, you're the circus. And that's not who we want to be. So you have to start with the very hardest of solutions and an engineer for that. And when I think about what advice I would give people, you can't start in this business with a halfway house. You have to have the final, picture solved. That's a mistake we nearly made at the start. And just by sheer luck, we happen to be in Ireland, which is the worst country in the world to do a drone delivery business, permanently raining, permanently windy. So therefore we can fly in any weather, but it comes back to, and it's very important. I know it sounds like engineering, but I'm trying not to be too engineering about this. But if you want to be real in drone delivery you have to replace the car fully. You can't be partial replacement. And that makes it much more difficult. The engineering equation is just much harder and the testing equation is much harder. Even the delivery mode, the way we deliver the software we've written for that arrival at the house and delivering, it looks simple. but it's not, it's quite the opposite. And then testing that out in the wild and, is one thing in a big field in the middle of nowhere, but testing it where there's customers underneath you, is a whole other thing. And that takes so much time. Sorry, I'm wondering, but it goes to what do you need to solve for, right? You need to solve for predictability, availability, speed equals quality, cost, unit cost, and yeah. So safety, I don't even talk about safety because you don't have a right to exist, if you're not safe and that comes down to, yes, we have governance because we're regulated by aviation regulators and a lot of oversight comes from that. But. It doesn't make you safe. There's a million ways to still not be safe, even if you're regulated. I think that comes from, there's a, there's an existential threat hanging over the industry if it's irresponsible when it starts to scale. And what that translates to, It took us five years and I don't think you're going to do much quicker than that. And when you start developing a backyard delivery product to, to really scaling it, which is where we are now, it's somewhere between three to five years timeline. And no amount of fantastic engineering, or engineers speed that up. It's a process of gradually evolving, crawl, walk, run more and more volume. You can't please the investors with this one. You have to manage them and let them know that it's a long, arduous process to make sure that you're safe. And I certainly see that in the industry, we've done a great job at that. I don't see anyone pretending that it can go, at blitz scaling pace, but it will, and I think there's a number of, operators like ourselves, like Wing, for example, Google's program that are now ready to start some really, serious growth in a safe way. So, but it is not your typical industry where a five year path normally to a startup, building a viable product with viable economics and the start of a revenue journey. That's very difficult, space by any measure. And so it'll come to what's the market look like in, in a decade, who'll be there, how many will be there, that kind of thing. Just because you mentioned the word safety, what it translates to is a market that's going to be a very few number of players with sufficient deep pockets and patience to get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, Bobby, delving into the customer experience a little bit more. Are you, guiding customers towards expectations for how long it will take for different categories of products to arrive from the time that they push order on their phone? What is a reasonable expectation for a latte versus a hamburger and fries versus other takeout food. Obviously the drone delivery operation itself is a consistent time period, but the preparation time and the other\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">what should customers be expecting?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. There's a very difficult problem to solve actually and the big aggregators have, have done the best job at this simply because of time and the data that they have. Truth is a restaurant that's preparing meals is a very unpredictable output line, particularly smaller ones. And from a day to day or hour to hour basis, quite difficult to predict. Now there's some very large brand players. I don't need to name names, you know, they are, but they can produce a meal every 20 seconds and they can get one through their drive through every 35 seconds. And so for those types of brands, we can tell the customer down to the minute when they can expect to see their nuggets or their fries or whatever it is land in their back garden, essentially for the others, and we have a number of vendors that are, they're a super product, but they're erratic to say the least. So we tell the customer it's a three minute flight or a two minute flight or whatever it is based on the range and the wind. And then we say, and the prep time for this restaurant is between five minutes and you know, with Google flights, you get this kind of bar chart of likely we give them a bar chart of likely arrival times based on the vendor's prep time. And we tell them what's happening as well. So they know in our app or through our API with our B2B partners, they know when the vendor started to prepare, they know when the vendors finished preparing, they know when we've received the goods from the vendor. They know when it's been loaded onto the aircraft. They know when the aircraft's taken off and then they can track it in real time. So the reason we do all of those things is the customer can always see progression and that's important. So the customer does not mind waiting 15 minutes 20 minutes for their burgers and fries, so long as you keep them updated on that progress. And so we measure time by stages, but if I look at my order to arrival time. So it's a time the customer pressed the purchase button to the arrival time. We see a range for products like our Coca Cola delivery, the median time for the aircraft to take off after the order is two minutes. Flight time is three minutes. So, so median time about five minutes all the way up to the premium, we've got this French guy that makes these, delicious sandwiches, but he takes 20 minutes to make the sandwich, but again, it isn't about the actual time. It's about the confidence in that time. And look, our NPS, our net promoter score is 86 year to date. And that's because we have this obvious advantage that we fly, but also we manage, as you say, the customer expectations very clearly. through constant messaging of progression of their\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay. So as you scale and demand increases, how do you keep customer expectations realistic? If it's coming up on lunchtime and you get a bunch of, order interest coming in and you have only so much, delivery capacity during that hour and that, beyond a certain amount, deliveries are going to be delayed simply because you're waiting for a free drone to go and make that flight. How do you prevent customer disappointment with the experience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And we have an advantage there over road as well, because we know if we look forward at the next 60 minutes and we calculate capacity in the next 60 minutes for any given GPS points, we know pretty accurately how many orders we can handle for the next 60 minutes. And that's the window where, it's actually between 30 and 60 minutes where a customer will say, I'm not willing to wait that long. I'll drive myself or I'll do without. So the first and foremost, there's no point adding capacity blindly if you don't know how to assess it in real time. So the way we look at it is we continually add capacity in units, as our repeat cohort of customers grows, so too does our volume, orders per hour, per day of week, and that's pretty easy to anticipate, and we just allocate extra capacity ahead of time. Overcapacity for us isn't such an issue when you look at the aircraft utilization, because we don't care so much about an aircraft sitting on the tarmac. We care about the people's cost, the people cost that would load that aircraft cargo, they're there anyway. So when we flex up and down capacity, it's more about flexing up and down the people that manage or load cargo or monitor those aircraft than the actual aircraft themselves.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the most utilization sensitive component of your operation is utilization of your human labor, not utilization of your airframes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Correct. Yeah, we don't really care about utilization of the airframes. I mean, we do, but in the end, don't forget we have mobile aircrafts. Our aircraft can load balance from one cell to the other. In other words, the aircraft can autonomously go from one location to another to serve demand in different locations. So we can dynamically allocate the fleet to. And there's other great use cases like parcel delivery, postal delivery, for example, and pharmacy delivery, even that you can take orders with a four hour window on them and just send them in underutilized slots. So we can balance our utilization through the day, particularly daytime hours. So I think as we grow, there'll be more of those what we call latent orders that have a window of delivery time that don't need instant delivery that we will use our fleets to fly. So I'm not too concerned about the aircraft itself. It's the people and we have two modes of operation. We have one where we're highly centralized, all the aircraft and a handful of people. And also, for example, one of our people can load between 20 and 30 flights per hour. So that's our number, right? and 20 or 30 flights per hour is the best you're going to do because our turnaround time is between 30 and 60 seconds, right? Aircraft landing, aircraft taking off and that you can't beat that. No, there's no way to beat that number. But that's the cost, right? That's that person's cost for those 20 or 30 deliveries. And you want them fully utilized. So if you're over budgeted on those people, then you're going to increase your cost per delivery. So that's the way to think about it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, what's been the biggest change in the drone delivery market in the last two years since we talked? And what's been your biggest disappointment the market?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The biggest change in a positive way, I think, well, I think for us, it's, the pivotal moment for us is reaching profitable unit economics. Since the last time we spoke two years ago, we were,$20 or$30 cost per delivery, and now we're at just less than$4 cost per delivery, fully loaded costs, including depreciation on the aircraft. And\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">revenue per delivery is?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm not telling you that it'll differ across channels.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Something higher than$4.50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's a great, it's a positive number. And like I said, I always, I'm not a great mathematician, but if you scale a negative number, you get a larger negative number, no matter how hard you try. no, look, we already have$4 in and around sometimes less, sometimes more dependent time of the week and the cargo cost per delivery fully loaded. Right. That's, and we're going to, by the way, publish this data, both on LinkedIn and through our friends at McKinsey. And so you'll see it and, but you can also see a very clear path to$2 cost for delivery, like literally with our eyes closed, we won't get there at the end of this year. We won't be far off it, but even limited scaling will bring us to a$2 cost per delivery. And what we want to win at is that, going back to the Warren Buffett, right, in a commodity world and drone delivery, ultimately, at scale and over 20 years commodity, right, it's A to B safely and quickly. The winner will be the ones that have the best cost of operation. This is why Ryanair succeeded, is why Southwest did so well in the earlier days. And we learned from history of running businesses that it's not the coolest product that's going to win in this space. Nobody cares. it's about the cost. So, so what's changed, I think we've demonstrated in superb fashion that the industry is viable, economically viable, and I think that's important. And then I think regulatory wise, again, we now fly BVLOS all over Europe. We have license all over Europe. Europe has really strong, difficult, but really clear regulations. USA has moved forward at pace as well. We see pretty much everyone operating with 135s, we see Google really starting to expand their operations, we see major brands like Walmart really leaning into it, so I would say ahead of expectations in Europe, for sure, and what we would have predicted in the USA as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What about a disappointment, Bobby?

I would love to see, and we would love to be flying under 108, very soon, but, still uncertain and uncertainty kills an industry like ours, well, it doesn't kill it, but it just makes it very difficult for companies like us to continue to grow and raise money to grow when there's uncertainty around the regulatory environment. And so 108's a discipline. Well, it's not a disappointment. It's great. We love it. It's the right shape. It feels exactly what the industry needs to scale. It's just hard to say when those, rules will be written and we'll go through the process and become, routine. So is it a disappointment? No, like I'm pretty happy that we have BVLOS in Europe. There's, 500 million people here, 300 million of which we can reach. so there's plenty of business. And I would say to any drone delivery company. get over here and start flying. Like Google are flying a mile away from my house here, where I'm recording this from, Europe is a fantastic place to build some scale. It's not as great a market the USA, it's a market where you can really get flying anyway. So, so disappointments, they're not really disappointments. They're just, it's the, I just wish it could all move a little bit more quickly in the USA. and other than that, I think we're in really strong shape.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How should we make sense of the different operating cost numbers that we see in the industry media or being talked about across the different companies that are doing this? From your vantage point, do you know if they're all being formulated the same way? Are we talking about apples to apples or apples to oranges with these numbers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think, there's some wishful thinking in some of the things that I've, seen. I would say, remembering WeWork and community adjusted EBITDA is the phrase I would think of here. You have to include packaging cost, battery motor depreciation, prop depreciation, maintenance, aircraft depreciation, personnel, all of the other costs, but those are the main ones that I listed there. If all of those aren't in your unit economics there's already a problem and particularly aircraft depreciation. So again, that goes to our aircraft has a useful life of 75, 000 deliveries. And that means that our depreciation factor is relatively low. And that's an intentional part of our product design, even battery management, battery maintenance, those ones should be equal for everybody, right, because we're all using lithium ion in some way. And we're charging them at different speeds, discharging them at different speeds, but largely speaking, while we think we're better than most on battery, I think you could pretty much assume that everyone's the same in that regard. I think where all of the players differ greatly is in longevity of the aircraft, how many cycles you're going to get from the aircraft. It's throughput per hour. And that comes to hot swap architecture or not hot swap and then charging in situ kind of the opposite of hot swap. Charging in situ means that your battery won't last as long. And after the person loading the cargo, battery is your biggest unit cost. And what I mean by that is if you're charging a battery in sub zero temperatures, or if you're charging a battery in very high temperatures, it's not going to live as long as a battery that's charged at a consistent temperature indoors. And that comes down to aircraft architecture and operational architecture. In other words, hot swap battery, the battery's only outdoors for 60 seconds before it flies. We've thought about all of that and we've thought about it because of our focus on unit costs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so you're treating batteries and motors as consumables. Those are not going 75, 000 flights. Those are being replaced periodically, but it's the remainder of the aircraft that you assert has a 75, 000 flight life. Okay, so how many flight hours, just from an aviation standpoint, comparing the expected life of this aircraft in terms of flight hours? How many is that? Roughly 15, 000 flight hours?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's a divide by eight, divide by eight. We do eight flights an\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">hour So what is the remainder of that airframe? What data do you have that, gives you confidence that this is a 75, 000 flight item? And what's your approach to continued airworthiness and maintenance of that object over that time?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Data. So our old aircraft, we call it the 3.8, was a 20, 000 flights aircraft. And we've never written one off before that, but we have many of them that have done more than that. We've a couple of aircraft over 20, 000, 25, 000 flights each. So we have formed there. We know what are the things to engineer for. When you talk about our newer aircraft, which we call 3.8.4 really it's functionally no different than our old aircraft, except for the propulsion system, which is a, it's a much easier maintenance system because most of the failures in our previous aircraft came down to wear and tear during maintenance, during routine changes of parts of the subsystem, props or, motors. So our new aircraft airframe, a single piece of carbon fiber, no moving parts. And that is easy to cycle, right? It's very easy to cycle that airframe through actually half a million flight cycles, on simulator on test benches, should I say, and get the data. And that's the process for evaluating what the lifetime of each component is. You're right, our motors and our batteries and props actually, for that matter, are in our unit cost. So we write off motors after 2000 hours. We write off batteries, in a number of flights, a number of cycles. So it's very predictable. And props less predictable although there's expected lifetime for props, it's mostly, preemptive, I would say monitoring for imperfections or damage to props and changing, but it's stack ranked it's battery, motor, props. And then we apply just a consistent percentage overhead to the entire bill of materials on the aircraft outside of that annual cost, which is quite conservative to get the look, this cable failed or that, that LIDAR unit failed or whatever, because components fail individually and in very unpredictable ways. And so I think the right approach there is just apply a consistent proportion of the overall bill of materials in an annual tax almost in form of maintenance and component switching. And we're, we've been in this five years, we think we have very good data on that. So we're, and as I said, we're quite conservative on it, but it's still overall the depreciation of the entire system for per flight is quite low. It's certainly lower than the person loading the cargo. And then continued airworthiness or maintenance and, the traditional aviation part of things, I would say our old aircraft or existing aircraft depending on what you're day you're operating on, is an aircraft that required a lot of overhead, a lot of maintenance inspections, frequent inspections, frequent overhauls. And we moved now to our new aircraft that just self diagnoses everything, designed for high throughput, long time without even an inspection. But it still backs down to very traditional aviation practices for keeping aircraft in the air and ensuring that they're safe. We, I don't think we're any different there than company that flies small planes or helicopters in the processes, the training, all that stuff that happens.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Given that you'll be publishing some numbers soon, are you comfortable sharing with our audience some high level,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Of course I\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">major cost drivers and the specific\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I actually, I predicted you would ask me, so I actually got a breakdown. Yeah. Yeah. Are you ready? Well, why wouldn't I talk about this? Because we, we do the best, right? So, so today,$4.27 cost per delivery of which fixed overhead, 71 cents, labor$1.93 consumables and depreciation,$1.63. That's where we are today. And then by the end of this year, well, look, I don't want to promise too much, but that'll probably be closer to$3 than even$3.50. Yeah. And then if I look at the human costs, so, and this comes to our operation, which again will evolve. We have different roles. So we have what we call a dispatcher, which is what others would call a pilot, that's a person that for us can monitor up to 20 aircraft simultaneously. What role they have? I don't know, because there's no sticks. There's no control of our aircraft, but they're there anyway, monitoring, but our loaders is our biggest cost. So, so that those are people that just take cargo from a vendor, load on the aircraft, just over a dollar per delivery. That's interesting because Ireland, in fact, Europe is a high wage environment, and so our hourly cost for labor is about$18. so if you look at that and then you look at our future system, which does not need those loaders, so when I talk about going from$3 to$2, that loader for us goes away and the vendor loads the cargo. So we're not in a rush to do that. We have the system built, we're happy. But for now we want to operate just highly centralized, very well managed, location. So we have that loader cost. And the number of the$1.63 that I mentioned earlier on in consumables, I can tell you stack ranked in there it's battery is roughly 50 percent of that currently that'll come down a bit with new battery chemistry we have, and then motors is second at about 25% and then maintenance, just a fixed cost of maintenance per flight that we apply and props and replacement components is the remainder of it. And there are some benefits to scale purchasing of these were obviously tiny now in terms of scale of purchasing. So that$1.63 we predict at scale will come down to about 45 cents. And so when we get from$4.27, where we are now, down to$3 or say$2 and 2 cents is the number I'm looking at, the bulk of that comes from reducing our consumables cost by just scale and better purchasing power. And then there's a pretty significant, unlock for us in change of battery chemistry, so going to a more conservative battery chemistry, but one that has a higher number of cycles and that comes from, again, this, we see this as a major advantage that our system has is that we don't need to charge our batteries and anything over 1C. So we can charge them slowly because the aircraft isn't waiting for a charge with us, so we might have seven, eight, nine battery systems, cargo systems per aircraft, and one of them is flying while eight of them are charging, so we can charge them very slowly and therefore get many more cycles out of the battery. And that, that counts in this space. It really does count. The top level architecture we have, we think it is designed for throughput, of course, productivity of real estate space, but also it flows through that because we have this hotswap battery, our costs per delivery are quite a bit lower than I think for people that are charging in situ, but look, those are the numbers. And we're actually going to publish the whole thing in detail for everyone to look at, but there should be no surprises in there. And I think largely our lower cost is driven by our higher throughput per hour.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Are these contribution costs, Bobby, or what costs are not included?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So those are pretty much everything.

So don't forget our cost gets diluted by the number of drones, right? And then that's proportional to the utilization of that same number of drones. So if we've resourced it correctly, in terms of the human loaders, then you need a 55 percent utilization of that capacity to reach those numbers. Those are numbers that we deliver today based on our existing volume.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What does that translate in terms of, daily deliveries per aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we do all of that with less than 300 deliveries a day for our four aircraft.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But there are delivery surges, in the morning, at lunchtime, different parts of the day, and then there are low periods. Is that right? And so if that's the current demand pattern, 55 percent is your threshold for these cost numbers, what is a reasonable expectation for the high end of utilization that you can achieve,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.

So volume is what takes care of that, Peter. So you, you reduce. Or should I say you increase the granularity of utilization as volume grows, right? So we already see weekends, for example, we operate 12 hours a day. Weekends are, I wouldn't say I haven't looked last week, but they're north of 90 percent utilization now on weekends. And what we probably should do is add more aircraft and drive more demand, but we are not motivated by volume. We've never been motivated by volume for this stage of the business. We've been always motivated by those KPIs around cost per delivery and optimizing for that. So we're about to open two other bases in the same suburb. So we'll be bringing it up to the gigantic number of 12 aircraft, which doesn't sound like a lot to most folks, but that's a thousand deliveries a day for us, more than a thousand deliveries a day cause they're very productive aircraft. And if we're successful at getting that over time, if we fill that capacity, which we will, once we switch on certain new channels, but think probably across the week, it'll be anywhere from 400 to a thousand real deliveries a day in the suburb. you'll have always have that right, but we'll flex up and down the human resourcing part of that across those, days of the week and hours of the day. And we, we think a natural place to be is about 70 percent utilization and at 70 percent utilization, we're somewhere between 2 and 3 cost per delivery.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You already mentioned that this is all beyond visual line of sight, and that the loaders are the only people involved, so no visual observers. Can you talk about how the, mission execution is done with the supervisors and any progress on the 1:many front.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, for us BVLOS is one to many. And for us, that happened at a year ago where we went from many to one. So we had like two point, two point, whatever people per aircraft down to now, actually practically we think it's probably 20 to one because that person, that resource really doesn't have a role. There's no mission planning. There's no nothing that there's really no role for that person, but we're happy to have that person there anyway, to observe and just to be aware. And there's certain areas, like we fly in controlled airspace as well. And Europe has this thing called U-Space. And we've worked with the folks in Google and in Wing with this as well, about de confliction and then bringing that de confliction up a level to ADS B IN to avoid traditional aircraft. Today, we do all in an automated way, but we'd also use that observer to observe the airspace, the ADS B traffic. But like I said, that cost is ultimately going to disappear completely because there's no role really there. Mission planning is automated for us, so when a customer signs up with us we don't see them. We don't talk to them. There's no interaction. they drop a pin where they would like us to deliver. And then we use data to decide if that pin is a safe place or not. And they're in the system. And when the aircraft flies to them, we do check while we're there to make sure the area is clean. In other words, it's less than a 15 degree angle. It's inanimate. There's no people underneath. And all that's automated for us so that there's no observers required. The mission planning is quite interesting actually because there's a couple of things that are surprisingly innovative in that space. I would like to say rocket science, but it's not rocket science, but the flight planning to optimize for energy use, depending on prevailing wind is important. And then we stream the weather from the aircraft that are in the air. So we have very accurate, very localized and very real time weather data that informs the next flight. And so that's a really important optimization for us in both speed of delivery, but also in, in energy drawn, which allows us to have that nice wind envelope or nice wind capability. And so that's very important, but another equally important part of what we do is mitigating ground risks. So, we have an effective population density where we fly. Like it is very populated where we fly. It is very dense. It's as dense as the Bronx or Queens, for example. It is really dense. And we're flying over about 450 houses with every single flight. So we take ground mitigation very seriously. And we do a lot of work there. And one of the feeds that we have is real time location data from users of our code, of our apps that they give us permission to have, and we'll monitor the space for hotspots of people. And that's a really important addition to what we've done. And so that data tells us, like, for example, if there's a beer garden, there's 500 people drinking beer outdoors in the middle of the summer. And we'll know they're there and we'll automate the flight plan around that. And so that for us has proven to be quite an easy thing to build where data didn't exist before. You couldn't really get that insight into where people were before. And in an anonymous way use it to mitigate your flights. So the flight planning is quite interesting in our world. And then the other part is aside from risk, just pure ground risk mitigation. You always think about, you don't want to be flying over the same places all the time. You want to avoid channels down certain areas to overbother people. So we ran, I wouldn't say randomized, but we, in the flight planning, we do a lot of work to reduce the effect of overflights. And that's been a key part of the acceptance aspect of what we're doing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What third party software are you using, Bobby, in that process?

I suppose our strength as a team has been in software, our businesses before have all been software businesses and either way, I think, if there was available software to buy in that space, we'd probably have bought it if it met our needs. But you have to balance always with software. The difference between software that's 95 percent what you need and 100 percent what you need is probably five years. I'm a programmer myself. That's my trade. It's often better just to build a simple system that exactly meets your needs, then adopt a complex system that more or less meets your needs. And in our case, like it is not rocket science where we're building, we're not going to be famous for how awesome our software or our hardware is. That's not what we're going to be famous for. We're going to be famous for our lowest unit cost and our ability to scale that, I think. But to answer your question, we use zero third party software.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm curious, I have to ask, have AI coding assistant technologies made an impact on your organization's ability to write this software?

I wouldn't call it strategic. I would call it an optimization. We're faster writing code. We're better at testing code. It just reduces the time to write code, but once code is written, the AI is no use to you and, we have a mature platform now, so we're more I'd say tinkering, we're optimizing doing small additions and it's very difficult to let an AI into existing code and start adding things. It's more when you write it from the start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Does it tilt the equation between building your own software versus buying software?

You might, get individuals just up a level. Like some of the code I would have written recently, and I use ChatGPT or Copilot, to write some of my own code. I'm writing code now that takes two or three days. That might've taken me a couple of weeks to write before. Mostly now when you're writing code, you're using frameworks or APIs that already exist to take a lot of learning, to take a lot of time to get to use, particularly in the AI and the vision space, and that's just like, I wrote some code recently myself that, that used our security cameras to look for people walking close to an aircraft or onto one of our landing pads. That code took me less than two days to get into production. And that's something that would have taken me a month to write before. And I'm, programming 35 years. So, so think about it that way. And I think that's the only right way to think about it. Just, it just makes existing good programmers faster and better. It doesn't replace the programmer. And so your decision, whether to buy versus build would more be about if somebody has matured a platform already that has done a scale drone delivery operation, it automatically by that fact will have evolved into the right piece of software for us, and I would buy that all day long, but nobody has written a piece of software that runs a drone delivery business at scale yet, except us. And I would say Wing. And so would I buy wing software? Yes. I would buy Wing's software, but I wouldn't buy anyone else's because the software evolves in line with the way you use it and you have to use it in order to develop it, I think.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You mentioned earlier that the consumer pays upwards of maybe 60 percent of the value of the meal with traditional, terrestrial food delivery. How does the drone economics impact, the wallets of the customers and the restaurants?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that, that number comes from actually a McKinsey work in the USA where they measured and it's, yeah, it's a 55 to 60 percent increase. So you buy a pizza for$30, you're paying$45 or a little bit more. In our case, we, I mean, you can get our app, we're charging customers$5 a delivery. And we haven't seen it. That's a little bit more expensive than they might pay for that direct. Here's my delivery fee number on the ticket. but we don't mark up the menu. We don't add surcharges. There's no tip obviously for the drone. So to the customer, actually, we're probably on a par with existing road based delivery, the way they might see it. Now it's only in the USA that everyone pays this gigantic premium on basket. In Europe they're paying about$7 fully loaded, but with tip and all that stuff. And so we're kind of in a par and I think a better question is, do we think there's room to charge more? Or do we need to charge less? and I think that's comes down to elasticity of demand. The drone does, favors there. It's really elasticity of demand on consumption, right? Whether they want the hamburger, whether they're willing to get it delivered or go outside. And if we're much more expensive than road based delivery, that's where the elasticity comes in. They're just going to go back to road based delivery. So I think our industry always needs to be on a par at worst with the existing mode or otherwise better. And then that translates again, back to our unit cost story. We think there's a world where a subscription is a real thing in drone delivery. And that's where we'd like to be. We'd ultimately like every household in the world uses us like Amazon Prime or like Spotify or just part of their monthly, thing in the household. And we think we can get marginal costs down to the point where that will work. And just like Prime or just like Spotify this is an almost inconsequential monthly cost for a household and we can use that to subsidize deliveries and still make our money by charging our partners a commission on basket value. So, we see enormous upside in the take rate or the revenue per delivery without needing to increase the cost to the consumer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How do you expect unit cost numbers that you shared with us to change in the U.

In Europe, that means implementation of U-Space. The regulations are there, U-Space is there. It's just rolling it out, but there's already four or five countries in Europe that will have U-Space this year. And USA, I think that Part 108 is the answer for scale. I don't think 135 is, although there can be the initial growth and scaling in the USA, which I think we'll all do a little bit of, but true, unlimited, unconstrained scaling, I think needs 108. So that's the bits that are out of our control. I think everything else is just execution. It's a capital intensive world, so you need a lot of capital to scale this, even though it's got a good return on it. Like our capital returns in 14 months when we open a new location, it's funded itself after 14 months. But you still, as we're growing a lot, you're going to need, a lot of capital to fund that growth. And I think debt will be a big part of that finance of the aircraft, just like in aviation. So will that be a constraint? Probably not. So then you move on to, again, the things that are in our control, but will quickly get out of our control. If we don't act properly and responsibly as an industry and as individual operators, we'll be punished by regulation. Cities will slow us down like they did the scooter industry. If there's accidents or, anything really that worries people, that will slow us down. So there's a risk there that with the rise of good regulation and the issuing of licenses that people might try to go too fast when they're not ready. They're rushing to get an aircraft to market. They start flying it and they ruin the party for everyone else. If anything slows us down in a material way, that will be it. And will it happen? I doubt it because I think the regulator on both sides of the pond have been very thoughtful about this. And I don't think anyone will be allowed to fly at scale unless they're safe. I just don't see a world where, you're going to have, people allowed to take risk. We obviously are not going to, but I don't think it's a world where you're going to have small operators that raise a seed round and start flying around communities. I don't think that's going to happen at all. I see this being an industry of two or three big players worldwide that will operate properly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby in three years, are you a$15 million,$50 or a$500 million revenue company?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In three years,$100 million plus, I would hope to think, and that could very well be all in Europe as well with some of the contracts we've signed and with the state of the market here, there's every possibility that we could get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And at a hundred million, you're a top three player you're saying in the world?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In drone delivery, we want to be the number one.

But there's a world where there's two or three other players as well. But, Wing seem to be focused mostly on the USA. We are too, but we also have the European side of us. So, possible we'll get there a little bit quicker in terms of scaling, just because the license regime here supports that, but, I'd be happy to share a couple of hundred billion dollar revenue industry with a couple of players as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:13:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I was just gonna say, in Europe, if you're a hundred million dollar company in Europe, you're still a tiny\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:13:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">me give you, let me give you a fun example, actually, that I'm surprised I haven't remembered this already. Without giving too much away, there's north of a million dollars out of one small base for us in annual revenue. And there's 10, 000 similar suburbs in Europe alone. If we just got to a thousand of them, that's a billion dollars revenue business and with a contribution that pays for itself in 14 months. So you pick, you just won't find an industry with those numbers anywhere that exists today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Then what stops you from being bigger than a hundred million in three years?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">it's not software, right? So it isn't, obviously the marginal cost of a unit is there always. We have to manufacture, we have to deploy the boots on the ground. It's a difficult business to scale. I compare us to a Starbucks rollout back to the Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz was on the podcast recently and he broke the numbers down and he said, look, it's half a million for us to generate a million dollars in revenue. It takes two years to pay back. And so he's all about debt financing and trying to go fast, but just it's slow. And I think we won't be as badly affected by that, but that's naturally difficult part of scaling our business. It'll take a while to get to a billion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already touched on this in the conversation about availability, there's, two potential paths that somebody in this industry might take in terms of how deep in a given geography they want to go, whether they want to offer a full capacity service to the customer in one smaller area or expand a little bit more aggressively, but not go perhaps as deep. How do you think about that trade off?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we think about kind of Goldilocks suburb of hundred thousand people and up, potentially we could make slightly smaller ones work. So think 50, 000 people and up. And if you look at that as a filter, there's some other ones like number of restaurants within a hundred meter radius of an anchor restaurant, an anchor tenant, things like that. But if you filter it down, you come to about 10, 000 locations, as I said, in Europe alone, that, that are viable for us to deliver a minimum number of, orders. so, and then if you say, okay, from a strategy point of view, do you want a thin layer? That means then you have that incumbency, advantage in, in many markets at once or as fast as possible, or as you said, do you just own a handful of markets such that they're impenetrable and you don't share them with anyone? And we've seen that play out in food delivery, in the USA and then later on in Europe. We've seen the way it goes. Each market gets its own lead player. And then 10 years on, there's consolidation for efficiency reasons, mostly, and you end up with two or three players in the region, in the continent. And I think there's a potential where if we just stayed in the main European markets, that a smaller business will start up in Sweden and one in Spain or whatever, we'll and for us anyway, we don't want to let that happen. We want to go slightly thinner in more geography, early than going deep. And primarily because we learned from the previous two industry scooters and, food delivery, and you could argue mobility as well. So, on demand rides where if you leave a market alone, something will grow there, and then you're postponing a problem of either competition on economics or, competition on marketing and owning the customer, and I think it's better therefore it's not a black and white, but I think generally we would favor going wider and more shallow. That's a stronger position to be in.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just to make sure I understand when you say that shallower and wider, do you mean not saturating a metropolitan area with presence in every suburb, but, perhaps a few suburbs but you're not thinking that, okay, once I'm in one of those suburbs the shallowness will be a characteristic of the service that you offer such that the risk is that you disappoint customers when they go to the app and say, oh, okay, great. Thanks. I can't get the service. I'm disappointed. I'm deleting your app.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">it won't be the customers that will decide whether they're getting drone delivery or not. It'll be the aggregators and the vendors won't give them a choice because it's a lot cheaper for them to fulfill that order. So when we say shallow, in an area, it means we go to a large city we'll do all of the suburbs over 50 to a hundred thousand people, but the suburb that's only 25, 000 or less, they're not getting the service because we'd prefer to be growing to the other suburbs in Madrid and Berlin and Stockholm and so on\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right. But whatever suburb you are in, there will be full and adequate availability\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, choice you mean, yes. and capacity as well. Yes, correct. So yeah, you don't want to go into a suburb and have a inferior product to what the aggregators themselves have and the aggregators themselves will want you, us, to be able to power most of their choice, some of their choice is impossible to power. You've got these real, tiny little restaurants tucked away in corners. And there's just, you're not going to get an aircraft there, but we'd like to think the 60th or 70th percentile of volume, we'd be able to get, and that in terms of volume of, or choice translates to less than 50 percent of choice. or percentage of restaurants in the area that you'd need to care about. But don't forget it. Go back to coffee. If all we ran was a coffee delivery business, we'd be a gigantic business and that would be a lot easier to fulfill than takeaway food.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, if you, as knowledgeable as you are, your background in aviation, your success in aviation. And as you think about advanced air mobility overall, let's say we break it down to a couple of different buckets. Let's say military drones, let's say commercial drone delivery, whether it be coffee, medical or the like. Or three, let's call it eVTOL, STOL let's say those are three big segments of AAM. What excites you and let's say you were an investor and you had to invest your money. I will assume you will say commercial coffee drone delivery will be an early candidate for investment. What would be next and what would be last?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">My next, without a doubt, in fact, if I wasn't doing this now or I wanted to do something new, it'd be military, defense, look at Anduril or Look at the geopolitical landscape right now and there's a race for sure to arm countries defensively with technology and that technology without a doubt is going to come in the form of flying robots largely, and that's going to have myriad sensor tech, software. It's a software play more than a hardware one. There's obviously a fusing of them, but I find that a really interesting space. And I think, the world is going to be investing a ton of capital in there and the opportunities are enormous and I'm probably unusual in that. I think that's a good thing that industry thrives because it's actually a way to reduce war, not increase war. So that's what I would be doing and I'd be doing it from the USA. cause I think that's where most of the investment's going to happen. So yeah, that's what I would be doing. I wouldn't bet on passenger mobility for a while. I just think it's too hard. I just don't think the physics work well enough yet, and the economics are, I find them difficult to see. You know, they work and it'd be interesting for sure, but I would, I'd be investing in, and working in military defense tech before I'd be doing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As you think about aviation technology, as you think about advanced air mobility, who are the thought leaders out there that you listen to? Who are the people that we say, well, when they talk, that's somebody I give a lot of time to.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You guys,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Nice.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I listen to your pod obviously all the time. I love it. but there's a number of players that, I have huge respect for. I don't want to embarrass them all, but I think, Keller and Zipline has done a super job. I think Adam Woodworth in Wing is an amazing guy. I met him last year. What they've achieved is remarkable. And closer to home, my own team, I have Siggy Zerweckh, 25 years in General Atomics that just, oozes aviation engineering. I'm wowed by the engineers, so you can probably hear that. And thought leadership in the space for me, more important than those, engineering visionary types that I mentioned are the ones that actually understand business as well. And there I'm afraid the industry is guilty of not being real from a business sense, but I have to say, it would be for me, Google and what they've achieved and drone delivery is who I would hold up in the highest regard. And thought leaders, most of your guests, I think, if I look back, you've done a good job of choosing them and I find them really every time I'm surprised, I've never heard of this person. And then suddenly I've met, somebody that's really understands the space better than I could have imagined. So, so many choices.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">One thing I think might be interesting to explore are your thoughts on, the capital that is going to fund the scale out of drone delivery. Right now, it has been primarily funded by venture capital, but clearly there are other types of investors that are going to step in and fund the scale out and thinking about, from your vantage point, who are they, what are the things that they want to see and then what will the financing of the scale out likely look like?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. So I think for who's going to pay to scale it out and what, how does the industry, get the capital it needs to really grow at its natural ability. The numbers are gigantic, right? There's probably a couple of hundred thousand, half a million aircraft are going to be needed in the next five to 10 years, maybe more, maybe less. These are big numbers, in terms of cash needs. I do though, think that the industry lends itself well to venture. We're certainly backed by venture, and we would foresee quite a bit of our future growth. So for us, we'll grow with a blend of debt and venture because we throw off cash now, remarkable as that sounds, we generate cash in a location. So we see ourselves as being probably 60, 70 percent debt funded. So think asset financing type growth and then equity is the other part and private capital for that. So venture. There's an argument that might say, private equity could get there as well. Large private equity firms could get there too. But our ambition is to take the business public as soon as we can. That is a moving feast because public markets are, not in great shape, but by the time we get to that 50 to a hundred million run rate revenue, I think the right thing to do for a business like ours is going to be to IPO because of the profile of investor that's available there. The retail investor will be very important to us as well. The amount of capital we will need to raise to grow it, as I said, to be the leader is enormous. And so it's our ambition to float the company as quickly as we physically can. But I don't think that's in the next two years. It's probably from three years onwards, but there's, there is an outcome where we're floating this business in three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, as we wrap up, what are some of the things that you'd like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the most important thing is the audience to understand that the economics have now been proven for this space. The viability of it has been proven very clearly, that this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That's, that is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think. There has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:26:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Excellent.

So I was really looking forward to this conversation with Don. Because as he says, weather imposes uncertainty, and uncertainty costs money. We've known for years, the cost of weather on traditional aviation. And listen up to the kinds of numbers that Don shares as those costs and what percentage of those costs are considered preventable. This discussion is essentially about what's possible in weather. Don says that aviation has gotten used to the lack of weather data and it's gotten used to uncertainty and that there are ways to improve weather today and in the future. Improvements that could dramatically improve flight operations and reduced costs, according to Don. Listen to what a weather pro says about the three things most needed for a better forecast. And according to Don, how data is key to improvement. We get into a discussion of weather on smaller things that fly. Drones and eVTOLs and other vehicles in advanced air mobility. Now Don talks about the need for better low altitude and micro weather and the need for better data for micro weather. He says that with drones, there's approximately a 40 to 50% attrition rate due to weather. But here's the challenge. Even though everyone says they need better systems in this case, better weather systems how much are they really willing to pay for those systems? This is one of the great challenges of selling technology to aviation. And Luka and Peter really challenged Don here. They know advanced air mobility is really thin profit and margins. And questioned their willingness to pay for better weather. But as Don counters though, they can't afford not to have better weather. So take it all in and many thanks to Don for joining us and to our many guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Don Berchoff as you innovate and The Vertical Space.

Don Birchoff, welcome to The Vertical Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, thanks for having me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's, something that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, what I'd like to say, it's not that they don't agree. I think it's just a lack of understanding about, you know, what's possible with weather. And, so I, you know, when you asked me that question, I think of two industries. I think of my weather industry, which is, my home. And then I think of the, aviation industry, which is who we support and who I'm part of. The weather industry, I think, is in agreement with most of what we're going to talk about today, that there's a lack of low altitude weather data, that impacts predictions and that impacts uncertainty. I don't think anyone would argue with that. We might argue with how to close that gap and what's the right way to do it, but I think most people understand that gap. On the aviation side, the challenge that I've run into is most of your aviation folks who have been out there operating for lots of years have really gotten used to the lack of weather data. And they've kind of built it into their mindset or into their business model. So they're used to flying and dealing with the weather and overcoming uncertainty. And they really, sometimes they looked at me five years ago when I first entered this industry. And I said, this is going to be a challenge that for drones and air taxis, the lack of low altitude weather. And, they said, well, why are you trying to? You know, solve a problem that doesn't exist. That was actually quotes. And you know, it actually did exist, but they were used to it and they didn't understand what was possible. What I'm starting to see now is as folks are flying more in the industry, they're realizing, you know what, we're starting to see and understand the economics around weather data more than the safety component. You can always get around weather by not flying. And, we, we generally had about a 30%. of the time when manned aviation or crewed aviation didn't fly due to weather. They could have flown, but they didn't think of it that way. And so that's really where the mystery is going to get unlocked here. We're going to show them that you can, make more money with better weather data. We're going to show them you can reduce your risk. We can reduce your uncertainty. We can increase your passenger comfort. And you don't have to live with what you had because technology is changing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, why is there the difference between those who know weather and the aviation communities interface with weather? Why is there a difference?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's a really good question. so I'm going to bifurcate the weather industry a little bit for you. You have those that are scientists folks that are actually in the business of producing forecasts. And they really do understand the things we're talking about. You need more data to make a better forecast. That sounds like common sense, right? But it really isn't as obvious to everyone as you might think even in the weather industry, because we have, the business side of weather. And the business side of weather, came out of really the 1980s and 90s. You know, the government had been the monopoly in weather and it had to be. There was really no options. And what weather companies did initially is they would take that government data and they customize it or make it much more impactful to a decision. In the beginning we didn't really change the forecast. Other than the human would look at the data and have this interpretive skill and heuristics that they can make it better. And that was the customized weather. People paid for that because it was better than the forecast. But then we started adding more data, right? We started getting satellites up there that were commercial satellites. We've added more weather instruments that are, privatized. we have more commercial data. but the business model has always been, and still is, focused on taking data, through apps and advertising, right? So advertisement, I always consider in the weather industry, we have a conflict of interest. The conflict of interest is, if you're in the business of providing data on apps and you're selling advertising, you have a motivation to have people click your apps more, which means now you want to, make data more hyper exciting, right? And then you have the customized piece, which isn't scalable unless you change the technology, around it, which is what TrueWeather's doing. And we have folks that like the current business model. And they don't want to admit that there's a lack of data, because if they do, it says we have to change the business model, which would disrupt the weather business models that depend on apps and button clicks and just forecast or customize data. So there's that middle piece there. So I'm bifurcating, a little bit. Now aviation, I think the challenge is weather's very complex. And, you know, when I was in the Air Force, I was on Air Force bases with F 16 pilots trapped at Kunsan, they didn't want to hear about my excuses about weather. They just want to know why weren't you right? Right. And, there's a tendency to try to simplify this whole process so they can make a decision that they feel comfortable with. And I think, you know, when you start explaining that you could do more with this data or that data, what I've seen in the industry is that they worry about having to pay for the data now. See, they like free data and the problem is free data is not free because it costs money. So to go back to, the edict here, in 1998, the cost of, weather delays by major airlines on the U. S. economy was 41 billion a year. And this is lost productivity, this is, decisions that cost money, it's inconvenience to customers and clients, that number is much bigger today. And to try to explain to the aviation community that's been built in the current system that there's an economic argument to be made, they don't really see it because they're not worried about the bottom line as much as the CFO is of a company.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The cost of weather delays, the 40 odd billion per year, how much of that is due to low altitude weather?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This study I'm talking about was a 1998 Boeing study that said that they actually said the 41 billion dollars was the cost of weather on the U. S. economy due to delays by the aviation industry. This is what got my attention, they said 28 billion was avoidable. That was the, that's what got me interested in this problem. Because that told me that even back then it was the way decisions were being made that was also causing some of this uncertainty that led to, you know, this 28 billion. So now if you look at today and based on what I've learned through my work in the Air Force and studies that I've done that have been validated, 30%, roughly 30 percent of, I, I think is recoverable, and the percentage of that due to low altitude weather, you have to bifurcate it down now and say, okay, that's general aviation, because remember, big aircraft don't fly at low altitude, right? They come into airports, they're well instrumented. So you gotta look at this and say, who's impacted by it? It's helicopter pilots, it's general aviations, and now it's gonna be drones and air taxis. And what I'm seeing right now based on, I can't really talk about specifics, but we're getting about a 40-50 percent weather attrition rate, meaning cancellation rate right now for some low altitude operations that are happening with drones. And my estimate is about half of that is due to lack of low altitude weather. And about half of that's due to just decision systems that aren't able to take this data and present it in ways that help to make a better decision, right? I don't want to get into those details, but that's about the way I see it right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'd love to uncover a little bit more of this because it's intriguing your comment about how there is perhaps still pushback from the aviation side that, solving for this low altitude weather is, not really worth the effort, right? Yet the impact is monetizable, some of the studies that you quote. And so is that because really where the money is, the weather is not as big of a factor on the low level, But the majority of the impact then becomes on GA and yet this is an area right now where the cost of not flying is not as high, because if you're a GA pilot, you look out the window and you decide that you won't fly because of weather and it's not like there is an economic impact as a result of it for the most part, right? So can we maybe dissect this business problem a little bit more with some examples and some additional feedback and commentary that you're hearing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. So, let's take the helicopters, for example, right? If you talk to Rex Alexander, who is a significant advocate within the helicopter community, who also is trying to work with, you know, Oh, good. So, yeah, so Rex and I, you know, we have these conversations all the time. He's worked very hard to increase the ability of the, emergency helicopter HEMS, right, Helicopter Emergency Management Services, to improve their, readiness and their ability to respond, and do that in a way to try to improve weather information through a system that has been developed by, I think, NCAR and the National Weather Service have developed a system by which they try to better pull together the data we do have and try to better inform whether a helicopter should take a mission or not. Because remember, if there's an accident on a highway and you know, you have to decide whether you're going to send an airlift out there or you're going to bring an ambulance out there what you want to make sure is that if you're going to send that helicopter, it could get to where it has to go. And many times they will not take a mission because, remember, most flying helicopters does not occur at an airport. The airport's the only place that we measure weather right now. You don't get the measurements between airports. People don't understand, like, cloud height, visibility, measurements only happen at airports. That means 97 percent of the country, you have no measurements. There's no measurements. Satellite can't do it. There's nothing. Same with winds. Winds only get measured at airports when aircraft land, or with two balloon launches a day. We have a vast, desert of data below 5, 000 feet. The satellites get down to about 5, 000 and then they attenuate. There's some that get through, but it's not really relevant. This micro weather problem is the problem. We have always known it is a problem. There was a study done from the ground up. This was developed in 2008 by the National Academies that said we needed 400 profilers around the country to measure what we call the boundary layer up to 5, 000 feet on a regular basis, right, to get this sensor data so we can improve our modeling. So the helicopters may have to go to a hospital somewhere in the middle of an urban canyon that doesn't have even, it only has a windsock. There's no digital information and if there's fog or stratus they have to fly VFR. You just don't know if you can do it because we don't have data. So they'll drop that mission. They'll say, we can't take it and it could risk a life. And so they send an ambulance out. So that's an example of just one use case, but that magnifies itself across the board, right? Into both public safety, emergency response, and business, because we haven't talked about the business side yet of not flying that helicopter to the helicopter company or the hospital. That's just an example.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What other industry is more dependent on good weather than aviation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a really good question. I would say it depends on how you define good weather, right? If you're a farmer, you want rain. That's good weather, right? If you're a renewable energy farm, you want winds. That's good weather, right? But it may not be good for your picnic. So, I always say it's the use case that drives that question. Now, you're talking about a really nice day where that's probably tourism, Because, you know, people want to go to the beach.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How about the ability to predict weather accurately, whether it be good or bad? What industry is more dependent on that, or is more affected by it? You just said there's a 40 billion study on cost and delays and cancellations. That's a significant cost to the industry. What other industry is more affected?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I'm gonna blow your mind now. In 2017, the cost of weather on the US economy was 634 billion a year. And that covers agriculture, renewable energy, construction, logistics, transportation. These are all industries that are affected by weather, and they all need micro weather, by the way. But the challenge has been is we haven't been able to build the business case to close these gaps, to collect that micro weather, because these industries, there's no real coalition. The other problem is the government can't afford to put that out, that infrastructure. I was a science and technology director at the weather service for four years. I had a 130 million budget, and I learned pretty quickly that the money that we're spending on infrastructure in the government has to be on strategic infrastructure, such as satellites and things of that sort. And we have gotten much better at long range forecasting because of satellites. But when it gets to the microweather, we haven't really invested in that. And so that's like the nearest target, but yet the hardest to solve because of the resources. So if you think about it, agriculture can use microweather, renewable energy, right? They want if, you know, every time winds are off by one or two knots from the forecast, the renewable energy farm could be hit with millions and millions of dollars because they think they're going to generate a certain amount of power. They've got a contract to generate that power, and they may have to go to the spot market now to buy fossil fuels to make up for the difference they're losing. And that costs them lots of money.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Don, this deficiency microweather out weather that you talk about is it really a statement that we need more weather observations, in order to have a better picture of micro weather or do we have enough input data and the answer is somewhere else in this chain?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you talk to folks that are trying to demonstrate that they are developing a micro weather forecast because it is a requirement, and people do need it. They're using techniques that downscale models, but not adding new data below 5, 000 feet. Just so you understand, the global models are like 9km resolution right now. That's the best. That's European. It means that every grid space is 9x9km, which means everything in that grid space looks the same. You're not resolving anything in that other than the average. Our short range models in the United States are three kilometer resolution, which is probably like a mile and three quarters or two miles. Those are in those grids you're not resolving anything below that. So if you try to continue to drive that resolution higher by getting down to one kilometer by one kilometer or 500 meters, you're not adding new data into the set. you're just, all you're doing is you're making it look better. You're making the pictures look really better, but it doesn't mean the data is accurate. You need real data just like anything else. You have to have data in order to do improvements to forecasts. There's also modeling. The modeling has to get better. There's physics and then the computing. So the three things that make a better forecast are data, computing, because you need speed. If you want to, if you do have the data and you want to run a one or half kilometer resolution model, it's going to take you computing resources, and that costs money and time, so you always have to worry, too, about turning these out fast enough. What good is a forecast if it comes out after the event. And the third one is the science. I mean, we're not, there's a reason why we can't forecast tornadoes perfectly, and there's still a lot of science. There's still a lot of things to learn. Even in icing, we have a lot of mysteries. So it's those three, but data is the key to improvement. You can't do machine learning without data. What I'm seeing in the industry is people are doing machine learning, but they're using analysis data. So the way we do historical weather in the weather community we don't have data everywhere, so you have to build a grid. You have to take the data you have, and then you build a grid, and you match that up against your physical models, and then you estimate what you think is happening in between those, and then you get a grid of historical data. But guess what? That's not real data. And people are using that kind of historical grid today, which is 15 kilometers or more resolution to run machine learning. And after they run the machine learning, they can't even validate it's right because there's no data. So, you know, that's the dirty secret in weather. Now, there are machine learning techniques that make sense, that you can do, like if you have weather radar, that you at least have real data, right? You're getting data. Although, keep in mind, weather radar is not necessarily always what it seems. Because you can have, areas that the radar beam goes above the precip, and it may be precipitating, and you're not going to see it on the radar. Right? So these are the, this is all the problems with weather instrumentation. There's no perfect solution with instruments. You have to build a village of sensors. Satellite, radar, lidar, remote sensing, you know, that kind of thing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So two questions. One, is is there a well executed accuracy assessment in the weather industry to track these various forecasts against what actually happened, so that we have an objective understanding of, okay, you have these large grids, we don't have differentiation inside, people are doing interpolation, they're training models off of those interpolations rather than off of actual observed data. But who's measuring how accurate that actually is and do we even have agreement on that, within the sector, within the industry, whatever you want to call it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, the, global models are being actively validated by the MET services. So ECMWF, National Weather Service, they are validating their models. The usefulness of that depends on what you're trying to measure. So, if you're trying to understand how accurate your winds are at 20, 000 feet, you're going to use a combination of satellite observation, and, balloon launches and maybe aircraft observations. And you, again, you're gonna map that out and potentially put it in a grid again. And you may not have a perfect real historical data set, but you have what's the best you can have. That would be on the average how you would, validate a model, using an analysis of the best data you can have and fitting it to a grid. Now, if you're talking about an airport, and you're just interested in validating your forecast at an airport for ceiling height, that's the best example of a really good validation, right? You can say, okay, I have measurements of ceiling. They come in every hour or more often. I can take a grid point out of my model and I can say, what's the ceiling forecast, what's the visibility forecast, the temperature for at that location. And that would be, that's your best set of data to do validation. So the problem is in between. So you have a point, and then you have an area. When you start looking at area, then it becomes more difficult to put a lot of confidence in all your validation. And so what TruWeather's doing, so, you know, just to give you an example, the low altitude has no validation except at a ground level at the airport. And that to me doesn't matter because drones don't fly at airports. And eVTOLs and air taxis mostly won't be flying at airports. They'll be flying out of urban centers that we have no data today. We don't know what the winds are doing in the urban canyons. We have no validation of that. All we could do is run models of what we think is happening. And they're not very good because there are a lot of estimates going into them. So, what we're doing is saying, look, we can't solve world hunger, but, when I saw the drone and air taxi industry coming up in 2017, I said, this is the best business model we've ever had for microweather. Now, you might say, well, what about agriculture, what about, yeah, they're all important. But when I say business model, I meant the ubiquitous nature, the amount of traffic that's going to be flying in certain areas. And the ability to amortize that cost of better services across a much larger array of companies and use cases. And so, my thesis has been and still is that we fill these low altitude weather gaps with ground based infrastructure and with drones that can collect weather data. And we use the satellites and we use the radar and we bring that together around corridors that are going to be your highest use corridors. Let's focus on that. We get real data now. When we run our models, we can validate that data, and we can then do real machine learning. That's the thesis.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You've painted a picture of the weather gaps that I was not aware of. I did not realize it was all generally around the airports. And, but I want to go back to, before we get to the microweather, talk about the use case, talk about the gap that you're filling. I just want to pull it right back just a little bit to commercial aviation. You mentioned the 40 billion dollars in delays, diversions, and cancellations due to weather, you're saying, and you're saying a large portion of that is preventable. So let's eat into that a little bit. You were part of the NextGen weather ConOps. What could we do today to put a dent? If you're saying a large percent of that is preventable. What could we do today to be able to help address those preventable weather delays? How could better weather, better predictions, more accurate predictions help? And how do we do it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, it's a very good question. I was involved in the JPDO back in 2005 for NextGen. I helped write the weather ConOps I had my, you know, we worked with a couple of folks. We had a vision that, you know, we would have to run more modeling, collect more data, improve the microweather. Cause keep in mind, even around, even at an airport, you're going to have microweather challenges, right? If you've ever been to San Francisco, you know about the fog that sometimes really messes up Air New Zealand coming in. And the challenge is that, you've got to improve the micro weather for the current aviation to help with that understanding of how airport delays are going to impact the system. Now, when Boeing said, because it wasn't me, 28 billion was recoverable, I mean, obviously that's a perfect system, right? We built this, NextGen weather. We couldn't get DOT and NOAA to agree who was going to pay for it. That's how simple this problem was, right? You try to go back to OMB, and I have all this experience in government, so, you go, we went to OMB, we said, look, we need to make this a, interagency kind of thing. I'm going to be frank, DOC, Department of Commerce, they've got their budget. And, NOAA has their budget. And Weather Service has their budget. And, in order to improve and get to what is really required, requires big investments in computing, big investments in other things. We couldn't even get them to agree who's going to pay for it. So that's the first challenge is just the bureaucracy. Then you have the challenge of the current systems that operators are using, we're using a lot of legacy systems in aviation that, NextGen ran into this problem, right? They said, we, you want us to equip our aircraft and do what and pay for what, and then we have to change our software. So the problem is, I made a decision that problem is intractable, right? Let's go after the low hanging fruit. Let's go after a new industry. I think the only way you're going to get to what you asked me, is by demonstrating it. And showing people how bad it really, I mean, how much it's really, costing you and then demonstrating there is a solution, right? And so then I started working with the ASTM. We rewrote the FAA to their credit, said, yes, we got to change the way weather data is collected. We've got to open up the spigot. We can't just collect data at airports anymore and say, that's the only approved data. We rewrote the standard. We got it through. It's published. FAA is working with us right now on how we can test and demonstrate that. Which means then we'll be able to get more data collected through IoT and other things as long as they follow certain rules, right? So that was always my thesis. I gave up on the big picture, right? I said, let's focus on what we can control. Helicopters have always been the bastard childs of weather. So I always knew they would be a fan. And this is where it's going. So that's kind of my answer. I know it's not a great answer, but I'm telling you exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Who's most benefited from low level weather and who really is not being affected at all.

What I was trying to get at is that you can take a lot more weather on an aircraft that's engineered, it's heavy, it's big, it can carry regular fuel, not battery power. You can put more gas on it. You have a pilot who can deal with, unexpected circumstances that will come up because we don't forecast perfectly. And you have a pilot who has flown routes that they know the local weather effects better than the weather people because you don't have the data and they never come back and tell us what they experience because they want to have that as a secret so they can get us later when they say, Oh, I told you it would be that way. I'm kidding. But, the bottom line is that you cannot scale this industry if you don't have better digital information, because that pilot today might be sitting a thousand miles away from where they're flying their drones. They want to fly one too many. There's no way the pilots can even know what's going on. They don't even wake up in the same environment that they're flying in. All those heuristics are gone. I'm sorry to say, Mr. Pilot, it's useless. Because now you're flying somewhere where you've never flown before, you've never experienced the weather, you don't even wake up in the same location that you're flying you're weather blind. And if we don't backfill that information with real data, you're going to have more uncertainty and you're going to be cancelling missions more than you have to. And you cancel them today when you could fly. 30 percent of the time when you cancel a weather, a mission due to weather, you could fly. I know you know that because you always get mad at us when we say you can't fly and then you go, I could have flown today. That's money. And that happens in manned aviation. Imagine uncrewed. Imagine lighter aircraft. Imagine a consumed data source. I mean a conserved data, a power source. You can't add more power on a battery. So now you have to make decisions. How far am I going to go? How much weight can I carry? How much recharge time do I have? And if you're flying people, how bumpy is it going to be? Now this is a totally different environment. So that gets back to your original question. What is it that many few people agree with you, Don? They disagree with me about what I'm saying because they can't see the alternative reality that's going to occur in five years. Every knot of wind is going to be battery power, just like the renewable energy. It means weight, it means distance, it means something. And, that's the bottom line. I mean, I don't see it any other way because I'm so deep in it and I know it, you know, I could see the future on this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The tendency to cancel due to weather, being, too conservative today. I totally agree with you. I was frustrated with that when I was flying. But at the same time, the cost of traditional manned aviation missions, especially in military is much higher, right? And there's human lives that you're putting at risk. And so there's a tendency to err on the side of safety. But when you're dealing with drones, whose flights are really short to begin with, who don't necessarily have a high cost of returning home, if the weather turns out to be not good enough. That calculus is a little bit different for that segment of aviation. I guess what I'm trying to unpack a little bit more is who sees the business value in this? There's no doubt that there is a gap, but how do you monetize this? Who is it that will take that data, that new weather, granular micro low level weather and have a disproportionately higher impact on their business?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's a lot to unpack there, right? So, we could talk about the military. Military is about bombs on target, reaching objectives. It's a different calculus, right? It's also about asset efficiency, asset management, because if you have limited resources and low density, high demand assets, if they're getting canceled due to wet weather, unnecessarily, you're not covering an area over the battle space that needs to be covered. So I can make the argument from a military perspective, which I'm very good at because I was in it about how, you need to be considering efficiency and using your assets in the military environment because they're not unlimited, right? And I proved that at the TACC. So, in the year 2000, I got to the Tanker Airlift Control Center at Scott Air Force Base. I was asked to build a regional weather squadron. I was the first and we built it to 108 people. And then I was at the Air Operations Center. We also supported TACC. And the first thing I noticed is that I was watching how planners and dispatchers were making decisions about how to allocate those airlift assets in those refueling assets around the world. And I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Weather wasn't even in the calculus. They would just plan and say we don't change based on a weather forecast. You've heard that before. I know that because you're in the military, right? So I watched this for a while and I said to my boss, the two star General Woolley, I said, there's low hanging fruit here. You know, we're not perfect at forecasting, but I could tell you. We are certain about certain forecasts, and if we're certain enough about those, why don't we take that into consideration when we're planning these missions? It doesn't mean we change everything. Let's just take a very focused risk management approach to this, where if we're really confident you change that mission profile, you're going to save resources. So he, he was game and we did that. And in one year we cut the delays. They were averaging 5, 000 delays a year from weather out of 100, 000 missions. So 5% In one year we cut it to 1800. So AMC says, what does that mean for us? And I said, well, let's take it to your financial analysts. How many more aircraft do you need to make that up? And what we found was that we saved them 200 million with that. So that's what's falling on the floor today. So we got that study. I'll share it with you. It was validated and we were nominated for the Chief of Staff Team Excellence Award and AMC made us validate everything because they didn't want to be embarrassed, right? So fast forward, that's what I'm using right now for this whole industry. But that was a military example. Now let me give you a commercial example. So I was up at eVTOL Insights two years ago and I had been asked to make a presentation. I was going to be one of the later in the day presentations and there was an OEM, one that everybody knows and is well familiar with that got up in the morning and said, I just happened to be in New York City where I grew up. So you're really in my backyard and I understand weather there. And they said we're going to fly air taxies and we're going to fly eight missions a day with one eVTOL. I said, okay. And, he said, we're going to generate 14 million a year. And I sat there and said, no, you're not, you haven't included the 30 percent weather tax. And it was at that moment that I trademarked the term weather tax because it hit me. People have to understand who are the people that care most about money in a company, the CFO, right? If I use the term tax, that's going to get their attention. So I got up in the end of the day and I said, look, You got a 30 percent weather tax in New York City, and people look at me like, what are you talking about? And I said, that's the price Mother Nature imposes upon your business, both real or perceived, because part of that tax is the time that you ground yourself when you could fly, based on uncertainty. And I said, so you're really going to generate 9. 8 million per aircraft. That's what's going to happen. And, of course,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Why 30%?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, well, I took my lessons from the TACC, and I took, other data, that we've collected to show that, about, on the average, depending on the city, you know, it all changes. I also said all the weather tax is all local, like politics, right? It changes based on the regime and the weather. But, generally speaking, when I look at all the studies that have been out about AAM, they just look at actual real weather impacts. They say, oh, the weather will be 15 or 20 percent, 50 percent of the time you won't be able to fly, right? But I know that you have to add that uncertainty piece in. So I take that as an average. I feel pretty good about it, right? 30 percent of the time, you're gonna be, impacted if you don't build a better system. So I said to him, look, I said, 30 percent of that's recoverable. I'm pretty confident of that. Probably more, but let's just give you a low hanging fruit. 30 percent is recoverable. So I said, first of all, you're really going to only generate 9. 8. Which they didn't like. And I said, but I could get you back 30 percent of that. And I said, for each aircraft, if I have the right systems in place in an urban area, I could get you back 30%. Think about what that is. That's like 1. 2 million a year, right? Then I looked at him, I said, how much will you pay for that? I said, don't you tell me that, I'm going to talk to your CFO. I said, if I could show you that, how much would you pay? I maintain they'll pay at least five to one, four to one return on investment. We could generate two to three hundred thousand per aircraft for weather alone. We're working right now with NASA, We're implementing, Urban Weather Sensing testbed at Hampton, we're bringing it out to Dallas, it's going to be around Alliance Airport, and we're going to do more of the economic studies behind this. But my argument is that you will pay me for that, if I could show you that I can get you more flight time, and by the way, more reliability for your customer, and if we have the better data, we can keep you out of rough air, we don't have to get people sick. Who are not going to come back on these small vehicles if they're getting sick. All these things. So, it's really hard to believe, right? I mean that this is possible, but that's kind of where my whole career has taken me to this point. It's all been a lifetime of work to get here and then to see the possibilities and now we're acting upon it and hopefully, you know, we'll be successful.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For me, it's not that difficult to understand the value prop as you're describing to me, what I'm curious to learn more about is how do you convince those customers that this actually is achievable and is real, right? Because it kind of goes back to how do you convince people in one weather app being more accurate than another. There's no easy way to validate it. You need to run, large scale, experiments and testing and retroactive analysis. What is the second and third and the fourth conversation and the conversation with the CFO organization look like, can you give us a sense of their skepticism? You're having to convince them how this discussion evolves.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, I mean, that's the big problem, right? So that's why I didn't go into conventional aviation because that would be an impossible thing to prove. When I saw the new industry, I said, this is all new software. It's all open data systems. We have ability now to actually make a new market around weather that is working in concert with the industry in understanding how they're using data in all areas of the industry, not just weather. How the FAA is moving to a performance risk based standard for weather, but for everything in aviation. So this is really being embedded and baked in right now into the industry as we go along. NASA's given us several SBIRs and we're going to be going out to Alliance Airport around Hillwood and, and we're going to be putting in three scanning wing LIDARs. We're going to put in the infrastructure that we think is required to get the data we need to run the high resolution modeling and to then be able to run those models every 15 minutes with winds that are unimaginably accurate compared to what you have today. And we're gonna, we have an economist, and we're gonna work with the operators, and that's the next step in the process. I realize you have to prove it. The thing I'm saying is I have no doubt that once we collect that data, if somebody wants to deny it, then it's not going to be rational. It's going to be because of their own personal culture, what they've been raised in, and how insistent they are that the way we used to do it is the right way to do it. I think we'll be able to show that. I just have to sit down with the number counters and show them the results. We have to have a clean slate, we got to throw away the past, we got to look at the future, and then we got to realize the software that's being built in this new system is very easy to work with. So what I did with the ASTM, as I said, all weather data has to be translated into JSON, GeoJSON, not weather geekism. I mean, one of the problem with weather data is it comes in so many shapes and sizes that people can't even get to it to use it properly. So I'm taking a holistic approach and saying this industry is the test for what I'm saying and NASA's been behind us and the FAA's behind us. I'm not going to tell you yet that it's assured. But what I will tell you is that I know you can't do better without better data. There's no data in the urban canyons. You can't run CFD modeling without real data to know what's really happening.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the air taxi use case, like you go back to the New York scenario and you postulate that with these micro weather forecasts, predictions into the future, what the weather will be at that very granular locale, that these operators will be able to, fly more often, but how does that fit into their ability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Or carry more weight, or carry more\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>weight. Okay. But how does that fit into they're improving their profitability on their bottom line because how many hours or days ahead are they typically selling a ticket for that scheduled flight wherever the passenger is going and are you going to be forecasting, so far ahead of time that they can, cancel the flight before the ticket is sold? Or are they selling a ticket and then canceling a flight before departure? How does that time window work? And the contrast in commercial aviation is really quite different because. Well, number one, commercial aviation is so weather resilient that they only cancel when the weather gets to a real extreme. People are buying those tickets, days, weeks, even months ahead of time. But, you know, in, in the overall spectrum of weather, they're, they'll fly in instrument conditions, they'll fly in visual conditions, they'll fly in a lot of conditions and the transportation mode is pretty resilient to the weather, until you get to an extreme. But in these air taxis, from what I've gathered so far is a lot of these are going to be VFR operations. And so they themselves are just inherently more sensitive to weather conditions. If you realize this ability to predict whether it's not a weather observation, but it's the ahead of time factor that it brings, how does that match up with the eVTOL passenger when they plan to buy that ticket? And how does it mesh with, the operators, need to cancel and their ultimate profitability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good question.

But here's the thing is that, remember I said, you know, I'm not trying to solve the long range forecast problem. That's beyond my pay grade, right? As you mentioned earlier, you have to run large simulations. We're running a very localized microweather model that could be a 10 by 10 kilometer area or even less. We're going to use the initial conditions that come in from the bigger models. Then we're going to have our data coming in our sensors that nobody else has. And then we're going to nudge that and rerun that model with our data. And then we're going to run a short range forecast, probably out to six hours. Now, you might say to me, well, Don, is six hours enough? Well, the answer is, we're not trying to solve the whole problem. We're trying to go after the most impactful part of the problem. People are going to buy tickets when they buy them. The question is, and I always tell this to people in the military, because remember, I went to National War College, I have a degree in National Military Strategy, and I always brought weather in as part of the campaign, right? I believe weather is a weapon, weather, anticipate and exploit, you know, using it against the enemy. And I also ran an Air Force base. So I understand the logistics. I ran the main staging base in Afghanistan. And so I, I practice a lot of what I'm talking about today and I tested it in real life, but what I'm saying is that last six hours is the key, right? Because now you still have options at six hours out, or even three hours out. The key is not committing somebody to come to a VertiPort where they cannot take ground transportation to get to the airport. That's the key. Period. And that's what we're focusing on. And we're also building an intermodal system. We just won a DOT Smart Grant with Fort Worth, City of Fort Worth. We're going to bring weather into this, as well as air. And we're going to start looking at how, if you can't get to the VertiPort, or if the VertiPort cancels two hours ahead of time, can we get you in an Uber Black, what those road conditions are going to look like. All this predictability, we are just a chaotic transportation service today, right? This is about just bringing more discipline and better data into the system into these decisions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, help me out. So, one way to answer Peter's question, I believe. Again, you got me at today, most of your sensors are at the airports. So what you're saying is, I would assume with drone operations, drone delivery operations, eVTOL, those things that fly low altitude it's going to be, really important to have good weather. Peter's asking, so what? Peter's saying, well, what difference will it really make? So it's possible, even though they plan that advance. Very good point Peter on the commercial side. People already bought their tickets and they're already at the airport. Now it is true. They may not cancel because of weather, because they can fly in almost anything, but there'll be massive, unnecessary delays because isn't good weather prediction. And so I think that's a very big part of the 28 to 30 billion dollars. If I only knew really what was going to happen. So in your case, it's possible what you're saying is, because of the big chunks of grid today that weather is done on, if I know much more accurately where the real weather would be, because of your sensors, for example they're less apt to cancel flights that they otherwise would have cancelled because there is no weather in that spot. And I'm guessing that's where your three or four million dollars, a year per operation would come from. Is that right? Is that kind of the so what, the way I'm reading\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it? Yeah. You got it. So what is, today you would can't, you know, you might have, I've seen this already. I've worked with some companies where they would have to cancel going back to Peter's point. I was driving away from the long range into the short range. So what was happening is they were doing testing, of some of these concepts. And they would have to cancel the mission two or three hours in advance because they didn't want to bring the people out to the VertiPort only to be stuck there. Or in the opposite state, you're at the airport and they're expecting an air taxi, and now you're not going to have it. So they're going to have to find another means of transportation. That's not as bad as the other one, right? Where you can't get to the VertiPort and now you've waited. You're only an hour and a half before takeoff because you thought you were going to fly there, and now you can't get to the airport now because traffic in those areas won't allow it. So, they were making this no go decision about two, two and a half hours before. Well, a lot of times they could have flown, and this is something they told me. So that's where the 30 percent comes in, right? So now we bring them out 30 percent of the time more than we did, and they're going to fly and they're going to make money. And they're not going to be sitting there with the empty aircraft sitting on the VertiPort, not flying and all the costs that goes with that. Does that help a little bit? I'm glad you helped me tease that out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It does. Help me out a little bit with, drone delivery services. Our sense is that eVTOLs are still several years away at scale, potentially more than that. some would say, but drone service delivery is happening today, and it's going to happen at scale a whole lot faster, arguably, than eVTOL operations. How does micro weather help, now you got me talking only micro weather, so you've trained me. How does micro weather help make a difference to the drone service delivery Does it really, will they make any different decisions based on better weather.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I would say just on, on Jim's question, when you're thinking about drone delivery, and let's just take last mile drone delivery, because so many people have a pretty vivid picture of what it is, that's going to operate more based on microweather observations than forecasts. And, you know, consumers will open the app and they will either be able to place that order or not, because this is all taking place within a matter of minutes. It's, you know, it's not like I'm ordering something three, four, five, six hours ahead of time and making some kind of a decision based on that. It's immediate. So it's just, okay, what is the weather along this two, three mile route right now or 15 minutes in the future? And can we go?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the things I want to point out is micro weather doesn't become as important if you're not flying scheduled missions. If you're not depending on velocity, where your business model depends on having a lot of flights, right? If you're doing surveillance on a pipeline And you could wait another day. It doesn't become as much of an issue. So, the drone delivery one is one of those that really depends on volume. And so every mission you don't fly you're dropping revenue that probably hasn't been told to your investor about how much the weather challenge is. So there's a lot of pressure on these companies. You got to remember, it's not like the current airlines who have baked in weather already, right? These are all folks that are going after VC money or other money. And they're, you know, they're embellishing a little bit of their abilities to fly, 95 percent of the time when it's really maybe around 20, right? So now they're already behind the power curve. The challenges with drone delivery is the winds above the tree level is not measurable and we see a lot of difference in the winds above tree level than the models put in there. The battery power issue, the weight carried issue. It just adds chaos into the system as well as the problem of you have to have three miles visibility you have to you know, be 500 feet below a cloud deck, all those things. Right. So you notice, I even talk about a thunderstorm because the thunderstorm stuff we see coming. It's the micro weather that's invisible or not notable that's going to hurt their business model. So, So, you're right. Now, one thing I will say, Peter, is that you really need about an hour, ahead of time because, you gotta remember there is an operation, there are people loading drones, they're running around the store picking stuff up, so, you know, if somebody puts in an order, it's not like it's gonna happen in 10 minutes, generally, right? So you have to think about the flow. So, if you have, I don't know, just to say you have 15 drones at a Walmart someday, right? That's 15 drones. That's a lot of drones? So every 10 minutes you're not flying when you can fly, you've just dropped 15 drone flights. So even the short range, and you do need the data, as you said. So what we've been advocating for is let's get some wind sensors on towers at 200 feet, 100 feet, 150 feet. Let's get above the tree line. Once we know what the winds are really doing, which we don't have today, that takes away some of the mystery immediately about power management, distance traveled, wind shear, there's other things I could talk about. And then let's get a ceilometer at every Walmart or wherever you're flying from so we can see the cloud height, measure it, because right now they're using the nearest METAR. And the nearest METAR could be 15 miles away and it may not even be relevant. You've been on airports where one half of the runway is IFR and the other half is clear, right? I used to, that happened to me at Kunsan. I used to get yelled at all the time by the wing commander because we would call it seven miles visibility but the approach end of the runway, which was less than a quarter of the area drone, was socked in but I couldn't call that visibility. He threatened to put me on a boat at the end of the runway to take my weather observation. So, my point is that all that comes together. So you're right. The data is important. Having that extra information is important. And then you still need a short range forecast for your flow to manage your logistics, right? To make sure you're not taking orders that you know you're not going to be to\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>meet. Don, you mentioned earlier that about 40 percent of drone flights are canceled due to weather. Can you talk more about that? And, you know, maybe be a little bit more specific who do you refer to when you mentioned this, and if you talk to drone delivery organizations that are really starting to have some meaningful and interesting scale, companies like Wing, like Manna. Do they have this problem? Do they, complete your sentences when you talk about the issues of winds aloft and how they're not able to predict those and how this impacts their customer service ultimately. Do you have an agreement on the impact that this is having on their operation and how do they think about this? Do you work with them? Do you provide services to them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good question. So what I will tell you is I, we are a Drone Ups company. I'm proud of the fact that they hired us, over another company after they realized that what we're producing is meaningful to them. They've acknowledged the challenges of micro weather, keep in mind that, when I say 40%, it doesn't mean the weather was bad 40 percent of the time. It means that you just don't know. So, that statistic really depends on where you're, what your weather challenges are, right? Some people might think, oh, in Phoenix, you probably don't have a 40 percent attrit. Well, I don't know the winds, right? The winds above the ground, you know, they can't handle 30 knots of wind necessarily above the ground, right? So your weather attrit is not seemingly the same as what you would think about for a regular aviation, right? That number seems high if you're not really on the ground and understanding what's happening. What we tell them, you know, is that we'll get you that, some of that back. And it means that you have to buy into the whole system. You've got to buy into the system of better sensors above tree level, some ceilometers, the way that we, aggregate data and present it through custom, outputs for locale and your decisions. You've got to make very systematic approaches to how decisions are made. You can't leave it up to a local pilot, to make that decision because they don't have the big picture. So this is the kind of work we're doing with DroneUp is trying to figure out how do we, really, you know, it's not just the data collection side, it's also the decision side, right? And how you build the system so that those decisions are made in a systematic fashion, that there's a stable process. I could talk about other drone companies. I don't want to do that because some drone companies don't want to admit there's a problem yet because they're still trying to, raise money. Others, are doing certain things that they feel they can handle it themselves, which may be possible. I just know I've been in the business long enough to know that you can't, if you're going to be a successful low altitude drone company or eVTOL company, you can't just look at weather as a data supplier. You have to have partnerships. There's even a meteorologist piece to this. There'll be times when you're going to have an area that has lots of drones that you want to fly and there's a system coming in and the models are going to say, you know, that system will be, you'll be getting rain at 30%. You know, one of the things I'm finding is what does a 40 percent chance of rain mean? Do you cancel? How do you make a decision with that, right? So, what we say is you talk to our meteorologist, we'll help, we'll get you an extra hour of flight time, potentially, because we say, oh, that 40 percent is happening north, it's not going to move down into your area for another hour. There's no automated weather today that could be the heuristical part of that, like you used to get when you talk to a forecaster. There's still going to be a requirement to have meteorologists in a loop until we're perfect at forecasting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Assuming a drone delivery operation is happening from a hub and covers, let's say a four mile radius, how much does it cost a drone operator to instrument this particular area with the necessary sensors, and then also get the meteorological service from you. What is that burden on an annual basis or on a per flight basis, and how does that fit into the overall economics of those delivery operators?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so I don't want to give you all those details because that's my IP, but what I will tell you is this. Our goal is to get them four times return on investment. When we talk about sensors, when we talk about integration, when we talk about APIs, and when we talk about getting those APIs properly integrated into, their decision support systems that they're doing. And when we talk about even having a forecaster in the loop every now and then, you don't have them every day, you only have them on the edge cases, you call them up. The goal is a 4 to 1 return on investment. So I'll give you an example. If they're losing, 40 percent of their missions today, we want to get it down to 30%. And if that revenue, we want to get you, we want to get you, you know, we don't want you to pay more than 25 percent of what that savings is. And that doesn't even get into the cost avoidance piece. I'm just talking about revenue right now. We're not even talking about people that are standing around and I've seen this doing nothing because they're waiting for the rain to end, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It seems like, the customers who could benefit the most from this, if I'm interpreting your, arguments correctly are the, high frequency, low altitude operators, drone delivery operations, for instance, right in the near term. Those are also, customers who are very pressured by, cost. And they are looking at every single cent and asking themselves the question, can I afford to spend this cent because my unit economics are really challenging to maintain and achieve. We see this often with, all kinds of supplemental data providers that yes, have a lot of value, but, you know, drone operators might only have the capacity to pay cents per flight for some of this data. So in that context, how do they prioritize the value of weather data and their willingness to, give up margin for it, as opposed to best effort, if I need to cancel a flight, I'll cancel a flight, I'll send it a minute later or a couple of minutes later, because it's really at a small scale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first of all, all those other methods cost money. So if you've canceled a mission because you didn't have good data, and you then had to drive that or find an Uber Eats guy to take it, you've just spent money. We're looking at this the wrong way. You're looking at weather as a cost of doing business. Weather is an enabler to make money. That's the problem I run into all the time. I'm not criticizing. I'm saying that what we're up against is a culture of how people think about weather. Everyone thinks about the cost, but nobody recognizes weather's costing them. You know, there's no such thing as free weather data. It's costing you. So, what I would tell you is this, and again, some of this has to be proven, but I'm, you know, there's an old saying, I don't know this to be a fact, but I know it to be true, right? Weather may cost you overall today, 60 cents a drone flight when you amortize all the impacts of weather on your ecosystem. If you amortize that cost, it might cost you 60 cents a drone flight. Alright, if you start paying me 15 cents a drone flight, I'm not, I'm using this as an example, and I save you 60 cents, I don't understand where the problem is. Why are we prioritizing? You're going to have to lay somebody off instead, or you're going to have to cut costs somewhere else, or, and this is what I say all the time in weather. It's amazing how much value there is here that people haven't realized yet, and they're actually cutting costs in areas that they don't have to if they just have a smarter weather system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. These drone companies that, that we've talked to, they have weather minimums where they are flying with about a 50 percent safety margin on wind conditions, rain, etc. So they have a pretty wide safety margin for their go no go. But obviously they want better dispatchability. They want to fly more often.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we want to get that safety margin down. You know, we want to get more certainty so you can bring that down to 20 percent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know if that's the direction that they're going to go though, because the drone platforms themselves are improving with weather resilience, so much. I mean, and a lot of it has its roots in the amount of energy that the drone can bring along with it on the mission. And so we know batteries are getting better. We know drones are being built that can handle stronger winds. They can handle more moisture in the air. Icing will always be a challenge, but short of that, I think we see the weather performance of these drone systems improving a lot in the coming years. So, how does that trend fit in with what you are offering to them on a forecast basis? And I would just assume that they're going to, keep the same 50 percent type safety margin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:04:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, if you're assuming they're going to keep the same 50 percent safety margin, then there's no business model. Because that, they're, for some reason, they're doing that. But back to the, the question, the bottom line is this, is that we have very sophisticated aircraft today that are manned and they, and we still ground these aircraft 30 percent of the time unnecessarily. The same thing is going to happen when you have your very sophisticated drones. If you ever use the term all weather, be careful, because there's no such thing. I've been told we can have all weather aircraft since 1980s. There's no all weather aircraft. The more you engineer, the more weight you put on an aircraft, there's always a trade off between engineering, weight, and everything else. So I've been in this a long time. It really comes to this way. You have to improve your engineering, but you have to improve your weather resiliency from a prediction standpoint. You have to work them both together. There's no one or the other. You're always going to have weather impacts and you're always going to have margins that you're going to give up if you don't improve the data. I mean, why wouldn't you want to invest in better data and get more margin and get more flights. I mean, this doesn't make sense to me. I mean, maybe I'm, I don't know. I don't get it. Right. I don't get why you have to have a 50 percent safety if you're got better weather data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there other alternative funding sources that are available for your capability or your competitors? Beyond just the organizations themselves paying for your services, will the government underwrite your capabilities? If they're looking at every cent, which they are today, and you're saying, but there's real value here, and they're just prioritizing their dollar, is there an opportunity for the government, any kind of consortiums to help underwrite the costs of the microweather?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. To answer your question, I don't expect the operators to pay, the full cost of this. There's two things I want to mention. Number one is once we get these low altitude weather networks out, they're going to be able to serve other verticals that today are underserved. So if you think about the urban canyons, there's a lot of air pollution. There's a lot of concern about how air pollution moves around transport through urban canyons. This data is not only going to be valuable to aviation, it's going to become valuable to many other verticals and they will buy it at some point. This just hasn't been a business model. The second thing I want to mention is that the states, can invest in infrastructure. So the way I break it down is this way. You have strategic weather infrastructure and then you have tactical weather infrastructure. The strategic weather infrastructure would be like those scanning wind lidars. You don't expect companies to pay, anybody to pay for that, right? Either that's going to be private investment, helping to fund that, that would then, you know, buy into that based on the business model, or we look at public private partnerships like toll roads. Right? So we could see that the states, there's like five business models where the states can actually buy some infrastructure, but then just contract out the maintenance, the data processing, and then, you know, you work out the business model with the state. Maybe, they get a discount for all public safety to use the data, right? And then you charge commercial some fee. There's a bunch of different business models that can make this work, which is why, I'm not landing on one solution. I'm still figuring out all the things that you guys have brought up, I'm well aware of. And so I've been working on the approaches to try to get around those, objections, right? So to speak, to try to find a way to make this work, to make it profitable and make it work. So I don't see the, drone operators having to buy all the infrastructure. I see them buying a service. And that's really where we want to get to. Now, they may still want to buy some of their own equipment for takeoff and landing location that only they have, right, like a ceilometer. But, if we can get everybody to share their data, you've got real data now coming in where you can improve cloud ceiling forecasts over an area to get a much better understanding. Today they don't know what they're going to fly in if they can't see it. There's no data. You don't know if it's IFR around that ridge. You don't know. So that means they have to stay grounded until they know and things like that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, can you share some, thoughts, observations, what it's like being an entrepreneur and building a, a weather business thoughts for aspiring founders in this industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you know, you guys got an idea of what it's like, because you've been asking me very good, challenging questions. And by the way, I do appreciate it, because, what we're really trying to do is very hard on a number of levels, right? You got the policy. Which I've worked on with FAA and ASTM to try to, you know, make it more favorable to bring in third party weather providers into the aviation industry. You've got the science and technology, which is all cutting edge. Everything we're doing is on the edge of technology and science. It hasn't been that this stuff hasn't existed before. It's been in the universities and labs a long time, but no one's ever pulled it together into a, you know, into a production system and make it into a business case that could work. And then you've got the culture in aviation, like, the questions you guys are asking. These are all good questions. They're all real problems. They're all real objections that I have to overcome. and that's hard. That takes a lot of energy, right? If I could have probably invented the pogo stick and it would have been a hell of a lot easier, right? But I like hard challenges because I've been in this industry so long, I've been fed up that we haven't been able to really change the aviation system, right? It's been the same system for years and it just doesn't make sense to me that we're kind of happy with it when it's so disruptive and costs so much. So, and then selling my investors. Right? So, this is not an easy sell. You have to find people that really get in and understand that it's really about the data. It's not about weather, right? It's about the data. It's about what the data can do. Why is it every other part of the industry says we need better data to make decisions, but weather, eh, we don't need better data. This will work fine. I mean, I just, it's so baffling to me. And I understand it. I think it's the culture. I think it's the way people have been brought up. I think it's just the system. And it's also, really difficult to understand what we're trying to do and understand why it will work. So I get all that. That's, what's been the hardest part. I mean, this, building the business, hard because you need money, hard because we need customers. What I am confident about right now is we will get them. So what's the second problem? The second problem is the pace by which this industry is actually growing. And I would tell people that are, trying to, build a business in this industry, not just weather, is you gotta have patience and you gotta have recognize it's never going to go as fast as you think it is. Don't dilute yourself thinking, that you're gonna, you know, do something different than everyone else, because you can't if the policy doesn't change, you can't if the FAA doesn't change the policy. And the other thing is these, all these other companies I work with, they're all doing new software too, which is what I love, by the way. And they all have their challenges. Like you said, Peter, they may not be ready to invest in weather, right? They may not be ready to invest in something else. So, I think, the key is, you have to know what you're getting into. You got to understand that it's a different animal. We're basically building an aircraft and flying at the same time in this industry writ large. It's not an established industry where you're trying to do something that's entrepreneurial and innovative, and it's challenging.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And as we wrap up, what's, one message that you would like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think, you know, again, I think this has been a great conversation.

I do believe that what we're doing is the right thing I'm always more than happy to have more conversations about this. I want to you know, there's things I still have to learn There's people that probably can help me figure out how to crack the nut Right? So I don't want you to think that I have all the answers. what I'm just going to say though is weather imposes uncertainty. And uncertainty in anything costs money. And, the only way that you're going to resolve that is by having real data to fill in that uncertainty gap. And if the data can give you the ROI and you can demonstrate it, believe it. If I can show you this, believe it, right? The implementation part is hard because the companies we're working with have to bring their company along with this, right? Who, again, have a lot of people who would say, Oh, why are we doing this data? I get it from ForeFlight. I can see my weather, you know. So, this is a multi faceted problem, right? That's why you have to come in at the CFO level and in the COO and CEO level. Because, you really got to have a buy in by the company up and down to say, yeah, this is the direction we're going to go in because it makes sense. It's the future of weather. It's the future of, networked information and it's the future of analytics. So you want good weather data in there. Why are you going to spend a billion dollars on all these other systems that are going to give you perfect data and then you're going to use weather as your weakest link in the tent? It doesn't make sense to me. Why invest in all that if it's, this is your weakest link in your chain, right? So that's my takeaway.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we certainly enjoyed it as well, Don.

And why not using drones for this kind of operations? It can be cheaper with drones, more sustainable. So it's now about delivery inside the port and outside, for example to the anchor area where ships are waiting for entering the port. When a ship is sailing to the port, for example, an oil tanker, before they transfer the oil to a terminal you have to take some samples to check the quality. Nowadays the ship will enter the port, will go to the terminal, people will go on the ship, will take the samples, will drive with the car to the laboratory, do the checks, and they know if it's okay or not to start a procedure for transferring. We're now looking into why don't we fly with a drone to the ship who's already sailing to the port, not yet inside of the port, but sailing to the port, take the sample, fly to the laboratory, and do the check. When the ship is sailing into the terminal, we know the outcome and we can directly start with transferring the oil into the terminal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our discussion with Niels Kalshoven, Head of Drone Innovation Program at Port of Rotterdam and Co-founder Drone Port Rotterdam. So, this is one of the few discussions where we're speaking with someone without an aviation, OEM, or advanced air mobility background, but has deep experience where the drones will be used in this case at maritime port, the Port of Rotterdam. We heard about the Port of Rotterdam and its compelling use cases with our discussion and podcast with Andrew Hately, which you should check out. It's become a really popular podcast on The Vertical Space. So after we heard about the port of Rotterdam from Andrew, we were curious to know what they are specifically doing today and intend to do with drones and other advanced air mobility, as well as hear how their current and anticipated operations apply potentially to other ports in Europe and around the world. So we went right to the source to today's guest Niels Kalshoven. Listen to a Niel's describes the use case at the port of Rotterdam, the implementation and value of U-space, the policies and procedures put in place to ensure a safe operation and the volume of operations today, and what's anticipated in the future. This is a really interesting business model; it'll be interesting to see what type of service eventually scales at port operations. Will the ports allow their customers to operate drones independently with some type of centralized command and control, or will ports provide some type of centralized service? Whereby the port customer's contract for drone services with that centralized organization? We generally see both models with airports today where some airports allow their customers let's say airlines to operate independently, or in some cases, especially outside the United States, there are more centralized provision of services like centralized gate or ramp management. We hope you enjoy this talk with Niels. It's great to hear how trailblazers are establishing drone operations, how they justify their efforts and spend and how they see the real value in return from the operations of the future. Niels thanks for joining us and to our listeners we hope you enjoy our talk with Neils Kalshoven as you innovate and The Vertical Space. Niels Kalshoven is the Head of Drone Innovation Program at the Port of Rotterdam and Co-founder DronePort Rotterdam. The use of drones is in line with the strategic ambition of the Port of Rotterdam Authority to be an even safer, more sustainable and more efficient port. Within the port Niels is responsible to develop the port area into an area where providers of drone services can experiment in a relevant environment. In the hybrid port of the future drones be used in addition to vessels, trains, and trucks for the transport of freight and passengers. Niels welcome to The Vertical Space.

So if I look to the, urban air mobility, and people, agree with me is that I think that if you look at the technique, it's quite far. But if you look at the regulations, there's still some work to do before we get really into the operational flying with the drones in the air, in ports or cities or wherever you think about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Niels, you're saying is that the operationalizing of the drones is potentially further out than what most people think?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, I think so. Especially if you look, to our port, the port of Rotterdam, it's quite busy at this moment. Already now, I think two and a half year, we're looking into this kind of new industry. And what you see nowadays that the amount of operations are still, increasing. So it's quite busy in our port area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right, then I'm going to challenge your comment just a bit here. So what you're saying is, that although drone operations may have a while to scale the way people are generally expecting, at your port, the drone operations are pretty much at volume. They're operating relatively well, which is, a pretty darn good drone use case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Yes, it is. So especially if you look at the regulation nowadays, it's all VLOS or eVLOS. So you have to see the drone flying. But still, I think we now have 50 to 60 commercial drone operators who are flying for our customers in the port. If you look one and a half years ago, it was only 15. So it's quite increasing in those, is it one and a half years, so to say?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Niels, give us a little bit of a background. So you're actually a port guy, right? You're not necessarily a drone person. So this is a little bit different for us. Okay. Tell us a little bit about, Port operations and how the operation of a port sets up the potential need for drone operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so if you look at the port of Rotterdam, it's a quite big port. It's the biggest in Europe, not the biggest in the world anymore. But still we have 42 kilometers long is the port and we have 3, 000 customers which are located there. If you look at the port operations, formerly we are a landlord, so we lease our land to our customers. This is one of our income and the other one is port use. So when a ship is entering the port, they pay an amount of money, for using all the, services from the port. So what you see nowadays that there's a lot of logistic going on the, in the ports. A lot of goods are transported inside of the port, but also outside to the inland or to the short sea, to other ports in the neighborhood like Antwerp or Hamburg, for example. And what you see is with the drone industry, it's quite new for us as well. It's already there, but there are many questions. How can you use these drone operations in these kind of port environments? So that is what we're now looking into in several use cases. How we can involve or implement this in the current situations, so to say.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Before going into some specific use cases, do you mind telling the story of how you got started with drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so it started two, I think two to three years ago, when we saw that there was a new development about drones and it was first, it was the very small ones and we started to, within our innovation department, and, yeah. Let's start with the intro of the investigation of that. So we spoke also to our board and they said, yeah, drones, drones is something our neighbor is playing in the garden. And that was our vision at that moment. But we thought that it was, the development goes very fast. We say, okay, if you, look into the future and see the increase in the number of operations in the port. We as a port authority should think something about that, have an opinion about that. Do we like that? Do we disagree with that? Do we want to have a specific role in the ports as a port authority in this industry? So that was the beginning when we started with this, research, which is still going on, but that was the beginning when we started to look into these operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So this was an internally driven effort. It wasn't the fact that drone companies came to you and tried to pitch the ideas, but it was more of a internally grown innovation project. Is that correct? Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But indeed also, drone operators asked to our authority for what is the regulations here? Can I fly here in a port area? At that moment, we didn't have any answers. So that was also a trigger to start into those investigations about the industry. So when you\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>when you started this, you know, a couple of years ago, what was the, primary, areas of concern or things that was top of your mind? Was it related to regulations? Was it related to the fact that perhaps the characteristics of existing drones were not adequate enough, or perhaps they were, was it about, the decision of whether we, hire somebody to do this or do we in house this capability? What were some of the main things that you were juggling as you were trying to decide whether this makes sense?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We ensure that all the drones were flying above the ports, that it will be done in a safe way. So do we have to regulate it or, do we need some extra regulations, inside of the port because it's all critical infrastructure. But it's also about security. Do you want those drones in your area? Sometimes you want them because customers are using it for inspections purposes. But it can also be that we have non cooperative drones in the port with other purposes we don't like. So those were the first topics that we say, okay, about safety and security, that's very important. We want it to be the safest part in the world. So with these new developments, you need an answer on your questions. And we didn't have the knowledge at that time. So what we said, let's start, gathering all the information, getting the knowledge, to know where we get talking about that you have information to where you can base your decision on. So that was very important in the beginning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so did you see drones as a way to expand the offering to your customers as another revenue source for the port, or was it about enabling the customers to bring their own drones and then operate them as they see fit?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the Port of Rotterdam, it's really enabling. We do not, build up our own services for our customers. So we are more enabling the environment to say, okay, the drone operators can fly in the ports for our customers. So we really want to facilitate that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see. Okay. So you don't, directly contract with drone operators and have them fly on behalf of the port, but you are providing an environment infrastructure, whether this is U- space or otherwise that we'll get into later that lets those, 3000 plus customers hire those drone operators and service providers and help them in whatever they need or they want done.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, exactly. Of course, we also look into the drone operations for our own organizations. But if you look at our customers, it's an open market. They are free to choose any operator they want. Of course, if you look at the port area, it's a specific category, so you need extra regulations to fly over there. But indeed it's open, so you can choose every company you want, national or international, that's up to the customers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's the need for the drones. What's the, and what's the use case for the drones? What are they doing today that was done by some other means three plus years ago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what you see nowadays, it's, already said it's all EVLOS BVLOS is not, yet there. The regulations aren't in the Netherlands for enough fly BVLOS. That will, I think, take a couple of years. What you see nowadays is that a lot of inspection is done by drones. Inspection of infrastructure, chemical industries, plants, cranes, all different kinds of things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's inspection and surveillance at the port. Where previously it was done by what means.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It was done by people. For example, if you look at the infrastructure, the cranes, the inspection of cranes, and look at the current status of the maintenance, it was done by people. And it took them maybe a week to build the structure, to get it to the cranes, do the inspections, get all the pictures, a video maybe, and then do also the analysis. And what you see nowadays that they use the drones, it is flying, for example, one time or several times around the building or the crane, using the camera, using the algorithms, AI solutions to also predict the maintenance. for example, they will do it first for a baseline and every month, for example, and they will do an update and they can, after several times, they can predict the maintenance. That's very interesting. So it's cheaper because it's less labor, but also you're more efficient in using, drones, for example.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And this is the infrastructure that the port owns, right? So in this case, you're using the drones to inspect your own assets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also, but it's also from our customers, for example, the container terminals, there are independent companies. What you see is that they're responsible for their own cranes and inspections, responsible for their own operations. And they do also, use drones for the inspections purposes. And if you look at ports, we also have, for example, bridges, or other infrastructures, trains, railways. There we also use drones for inspections. So it's both for our customers are using it, but also the port authority is using it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what is the primary, benefit or value that either the port or the customers see? In this case, let's take using drones for inspection and surveillance. Is the value realized in much, less time spent on doing these things, or is the value in having more frequent inspections and therefore predictive, interventions and maintenance, and therefore you save money over a longer period of time. Or is it something else? When you were going through the business case for these drones. Where did you see the value? How quickly and how strongly does that ROI resonate?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's always in combination. So indeed, you're more efficient in, doing, it quicker. So that's, related to the price cheaper. But also if you look to the safety, when you have to build a structure to inspect a crane with, and people have to get up to the structure,\\ it's, I think, also safer to use a drone instead of. So it's a combination of, time management, efficiency, in the duration and also safety. And that's makes it cheaper to use drones in these, topics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the trade offs? You mentioned things that you gain by using drones. What are the things that you sacrifice a little bit? Is it perhaps the, human touch, if we can call it that, of a knowledgeable worker that can, identify things better than perhaps machines at this point, or is it something else? What I'd like to, bring up in this conversation is what it was like convincing management to roll this out. What were the, concerns raised? What was that back and forth discussion? Obviously you mentioned security and safety, and then on the benefit side, saving time, being more efficient, saving, lives potentially, but, can we get a little bit deeper into how that calculus looked like for the port.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A very good question. We don't always have the figures yet, but if you look at it from the customer point of view, it's for them always about, do it in a cheaper way or in a safer way. If you look at as a port authority, for us, it's very important that when people are flying in the ports, it will be done on the safe way. So it's another point of view, so to say, if you look to our customers or the port authority. At the end, I think one of the most important things is indeed safety. That it's for all people. It has to be done on a safe way and a secure way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What changes to existing processes were required when you introduced drones into the workflow?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:43\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so we looked indeed to the processes and the procedures. We're now looking into, we started the proof of concept for a U- space airspace. When they start to fly, they will fill in a flight request. So for now we know who's flying in the air. And that's quite a new procedure. If you look for a couple of years ago, there was none of them. So at least we know that. Those are quite new for us as well. So we formally, we're specialized in traffic management on the water. Now we're also looking to the air. So all those, procedures and processes, which are important for that, those are quite new for a port authority, maybe not so for an airport, but for a port authority, it's quite new. So that was quite a challenge for us also because, sometimes you fly above and the container, terminal, okay. Then a drone falls down on a container. That's not so exciting. Of course, there can be some damage on your drone, but not on the container. If you compare it to a chemical industry, that can be very, dangerous if you look to the dangerous goods. We're still looking in of all those kinds of procedures, what kind of, risk, mitigations must be taken into account for a container terminal or in chemical industry or, flying above, water, for example, ships. Those are quite new for us and we're still looking at several of those procedures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about procedures on the enterprise side of, let's say, teams that inspect assets, whether those are cranes or railroads, chemical plants, or any other infrastructure in the port that the port owns. How did their workflow change from, previous iteration or version of manually collecting the data, maybe taking some pictures and then uploading those pictures into some ERP like system that then tracks over time, the state of this infrastructure. How did that change with the drones and were there any required updates to those systems in order to accommodate drones in this workflow.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so I don't have the knowledge of the really in depth and the detail procedures from what of our customers, what I can say is that what you see is that they're now collecting a lot of data, so that is something different in the way of working. So when they're using a lot of AI algorithms to process all this data. And get also good results of all their images and the cameras they, or the images they get into the system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you talked about inspection and surveillance. What other use cases are prominent today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what we're now looking into is also several use cases. One is, for example, delivery. Delivery of packages inside of the port, but also outside. For example, we have a customer, who's now bringing 130 packages daily to ships and is doing it with boats, very small speed boats. And, yeah, why do you, why not using drones for that, this kind of operations? It's, it can be cheaper with drones. It can more sustainable. That's also very important topic. so it's now about delivery inside the port and outside, for example, to the anchor area where, ships are waiting, for entering the port. That's very interesting for us, but also, for example, when a ship is, sailing to the port, for example, an oil tanker. Before they transfer the oil to a terminal, you have to take some samples to check the quality. And those samples first has to go to the laboratory to do the checks. So nowadays the ship will enter the port, and will go to the terminal. Then and, people will go on the board, on the ship, will take the samples will drive with the car to the laboratory, do the checks, and they know if it's okay or not to start a procedure for transferring the oil. We're now looking into why don't we fly with a drone to the ship who's already sailing to the port, not yet inside of the port, but sailing to the port, take the sample, fly to the laboratory, and do the check. When the ship is sailing, into the terminal, we know the outcome and we can directly start with transferring the oil into the terminal. It's like more, if you look in a port, it's about the port optimization. How can you help that and make it more efficient and faster, and that the ship can transfer the oil and after that go directly to the next port. So that's very interesting for us as well. another use case is looking to eVTOLs. For example, when a crew is, has to be changed. For now, all tech, they will go off the ship and drive the taxis to the airport. Why don't we use air taxis for that? Because we don't have any public transportation over there. Another topic can be that our fire department in the port is fairly sophisticated and is already using drones, when the ship is on fire. They've, if the ship is on sea, they will fly with helicopters to the ships and their equipment is, they have a lot of equipment. It's too big to put it as well on the helicopter. So you need another helicopter. Why don't you use a very big cargo drone to fly the equipment to the ship and the fire department to go fight the helicopter? So those are the next, use cases we are looking into and yeah, can make a difference for a port, not only for the port authority, but for our customers, as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>90 percent of the drone operations are for infrastructure inspections.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exactly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And they're operated, help me clarify this with Luka's good questions, and they're operated by one of the 3, 000 customers of the port.

Very good. and if I could, and you spelled out many use cases for, let's say, AAM. So drones, you talked about larger cargo drones, you talked about, eVTOL, and again, for our audience, you're not a drone guy, you are a port guy. And you're saying, we used to, and historically, we never had to worry about the air, or to manage the air. Talk a little bit more about that. Tell us about how you were first introduced to it, what software you used to manage that process, who are the people who operate it, and how easy is it to operate, and what are some of the challenges there?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. To manage the, the very low airspace, we're now looking in, uSpace airspace. That's, it's quite new for us as well. There is already some regulations for the, from the European Union but it's not in, implemented yet in, in the Netherlands. We still wanted to investigate what is U- space airspace and can that be a solution if you look at the increase of, drone operations in the ports? Not only the small one, but also the bigger one. And also, if you look into the BVLOS operations, then I think it will be very crowded in the air. And that's the reason we start this proof of concept, for two years. And what we really wanted to investigate is the USPACE airspace and solutions. So manage the very lower airspace below the 150 meters. Is that something, interesting for our ports area? And besides that, the second one is, we're now responsible for the water, but is the port authority also the one we should do this? Or is there some other authority who should be responsible for this? Those were the research questions when we started this project, because we didn't know what it was exactly. Then we said, okay, just let's do it. Let's make it happen and let's see what it brings to us. And, it's what you see nowadays is be selected, and, provider. And, they call it an UTM system. And, UTM\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Who's\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Who\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>is the provider, Niels?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The provider in this case is Airwayz. so they are the developer of the system and we are the operators of the system. So they are, they've developed the whole system and, from, and they have a background in the manned aviations and what you see nowadays, they focus on the unmanned aviations. And within that system, there are several services we, you can deliver, eh, for example, the traffic management, you get all the information, from all the drone operators. You can do the traffic management and you can say also, someone is already flying over here, please wait for several minutes, or do take another route. This is an alternative we can give you. So that's all in this system, and that's called the UTM, the Unmanned Aircraft System for Traffic Management.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>how do people, you know, file their plan and how do they get approved? And, what's this tactical and strategic deconfliction? Explain that process because our audience will love to hear the practical use case here that Andrew Hately talked a little bit about as well in his podcast.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. we have several, if you look at the solution of use, use USP, you have to integrate all the drone operators into the system. So the drone operator has his own command and control system for the fleet management, where they can control their drones. And we have the traffic management system. Our UTM. So what you want is that the drone operators, when they start, do the preparations for the flight, so the pre flight, they will, fill in a flight plan and ask for a specific route, for example, from A to B. And, we will look in the area if somebody is already flying there and so not, we approve the, the request and otherwise we will withdraw it. And when they get, approval, they can take off and flight from A to B because we have in direct integrations, we get also in the, in-flight or the telemetry. So anytime we know where the drone is flying, that's is also very, easy. If you looked, eh, into the UTM system, it's like an aerial picture. So what you see is what we have. All the drones will, applied with the fly plan. In the system we also have manned aviation we also have the AIS data. So those are the ships were sailing in the ports. And we're now we have also the non cooperative drones information. So there's several information\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is all integrated into the software, Niels.

That is, we're now looking into the last part is the non cooperative drones. But when we have that, we have a very nice aerial picture, and then you can say we have all the information in the lower airspace and can start with the really de conflicting of the drone in the drones. And that's very interesting. Maybe not for now, because it's all VLOS and eVLOS, but in this case it will learn a lot. We get a lot of information and we learn by day. how we, get into the de conflicting for the BVLOS flights. And also what you can do is, because you get all, a lot of statistics, data, you can also look to, okay, how we can mitigate the specific ground risk or air risk. So make it easier for our drone operators to fly it in our port. And that's very interesting as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Speaking of air risk and ground risk, can you go into a little bit more detail what level of air risk class and ground risk you are operating in and what is the resulting SAIL level?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if you look at the prototype we're now running, it's in G class. So we're close by the airport, Rotterdam The Hague airport. That's a controlled area. So to say the CTR, but we are looking outside of that. So where the area where you are doing the proof of concept is the G class. Because of the operations we have now, we don't have any SAIL 4 yet. It's all about SAIL 2, SAIL 3 some of them. and that's more or less, nowadays, but yeah, because it's still VLOS and EVLOS. But we're now looking into several operations, for example, the BVLOS, and we're now looking at looking in how we can get the drones into SAIL 4, for this and what do we need? What kind of data do we need for our regulators to convince them that it's secure and safe to fly, with these drones, and say, okay, with this information, we know at least it's safe to fly BVLOS in our area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see. maybe this is getting too much into the weeds, but I'm curious the ground risk, determination. Are ports considered a controlled ground area for purposes of classifying risk?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't have all the knowledge of that, I have to say, but I know that if you look at specific, ground risk, when a lot of people are walking there, Let's put it that way, the drone operator at the end is responsible to look into the ground risk and, has authorization from our authority to fly above certain area\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. And the reason I'm asking is because, you know, just by looking at how a safety case can be put forward in front of the regulators and the fact that it is a controlled ground, area where only the people who are involved are present and that you can, manage that ground risk, and also from a, air risk class sounds like, initially you're flying very close to infrastructure, you're, in an uncontrolled airspace, it seems like it would be already very fertile ground to be able to fly BVLOS, and I'm surprised why it hasn't happened yet in an environment like that, where you compare to, the drone delivery space, for instance, where BVLOS flights are happening over suburban areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's true. And that's, I think that's for, if you look to the port or to the Netherlands, that's one of our biggest, challenges, to convince our regulators that we can fly in a very safe way and that it can also be BVLOS. What we also try nowadays is because of the infrastructure we have and all the data and we want to try to, for example, the fire department to get the first one will fly BVLOS above water. And they are not a commercial one, so it's easier for them to do this kind of operations, and starts building up again all the data and convince our authority and regulators that it's very safe to do it in this way and that we have data that we convince them that, that you can fly BVLOS above water with these kind of data and infrastructure we supply nowadays.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>32:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned earlier that you think it'll take another couple of years until the National Aviation Authority is convinced and that before BVLOS flights can happen. And again, that strikes me as way too long and so what is it that, that the aviation authority in Netherlands is having an issue with, and are they trying to impose things that are above and beyond what's established and mandated by EASA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you compare it, for example, with autonomous cars, it's also the same in The Netherlands. The technique is there, the car is there, but the regulation isn't yet there. So they're mostly always behind. So that's the same what we see now in the drone industry as well. But anyway, what we see now is that the regulators See what we're now doing in not only in the Port of Rotterdam, but also in other cities or ports and they already get the trust that it's, we can do it in a very safe way. What you see nowadays that they are really keen to help us. And we now also will start a BVLOS corridor. which will start from the port of Rotterdam to a test center which is close by, 30 kilometers away. And, that's a really first start for us, to fly, several BVLOS operations, above, water. But I agree with you, it can always be, can always be faster. and I'm convinced that we, looking at what we have nowadays in infrastructure, digital, we can already start with some operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:28\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At some point, I'd love to cover the vision for how this operates at scale at the port and whether it's decentralized and you have 3, 000 different customers who are planning their flights and flying them as they see that they need to for their purposes and the IT system manages the safety of that.

And that is one of the questions, for a port authority. Is that something, we want to, let it up to the market, or is that something as a port authority you should want to do that? And that's a very interesting question and we don't have the answer yet. But what you see nowadays is that, for example, if you look to a USSP and you want to get several information layers in that, that sometimes, speaking as a port authority, we have more information than other parties will have. And we're not always allowed to share those information because of the authority we are. So it's also a very interesting question is if we can provide a port authority the services and other commercial parties can also, will be there a difference in services quality and also in, in costs? Is there a price differences in the future as well? And also to the price discussion, it's very interesting and also a very big question mark, because for now we know about what the, we invest in all the infrastructure, but what the model will be, the business model of using USpace Airspace. So will you charge all the drone operators or not? We don't have an answer yet. that's a very big question mark. And we know that we will have to charge them because if you use the infrastructure and etc, maybe it can, for us, it can be breakeven or do you want to make some money on that as a commercial party? So those are very interesting topics as well.

I can imagine we already started doing some research, but it's also depending if you only fly in the port, what is happening if you cross the USpace airspace. So those are several scenarios you can write down and say, okay, what then, what should I charge the drone operator? And I have to be honest, I really don't know yet.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you talk to customers or operators, what kind of feedback are you receiving?

On one hand, it's people who are selling drones to the independent operators that are running them today, which is, relatively peanuts. If you are going to charge for something, Niels, you're charging for access to the airspace, I'm assuming, is what you're charging for. And in the future, you may be charging for a service. Whereas Peter's question was getting to, you may provide a centralized service rather than having thousands of people running their individual drones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you look at it as a port authority and looking at the port area, I think, but that's my personal opinion, I think I would prefer a centralized service. So everyone knows how much it will cost to fly in the port or cross the port and then it's very because we have so many people who want to fly over there and you have to organize or orchestrate in a way that you are still attractive and that you're not charging too much to your customers, that you're not attractive anymore as a port in a broader perspective. So it's, we want to have it at least in a safe way. It's the same if we look at the traffic information on water. You want that it will be done in a safe way and it, you need infrastructure for that and our customers understand they have to pay for it. Yeah. question is indeed, do you have to make a lot of money for that? And that's not always the case for us. As a port authority, I think it's more interested that we have more customers here, who bring their businesses here. And that's more valuable for us than making money out of these kinds of services.

So what in the transportation nowadays is it's under the five kilogram or something like that. Of course, we're looking to the next step is the heavier cargo drones. And when it's allowed also to fly with those kind of drones, up to 25, payload kilogram, for example, then you will also see the bigger cargo will also be, delivered. So it's a little bit depending of what is possible, and, nowadays and what is allowed nowadays. and, yeah.

I think if you look at the products nowadays, I think it's about the distance you can fly, the time the drone can be in the air. And that, of course, is dependent of the batteries. For now, it's all about batteries nowadays. You already see that they also look to the hydrogen, of course, or in combination, hybrid. But I think nowadays it's the combination of, the duration you can fly in the air.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any interesting insights or feedback from when you're talking to customers how they think about whether to outsource drone services to an operator or whether given the volumes, it makes sense for them to develop that capability in house?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A very good question, because it's also depending on what their core business is. If you look to the example where we talked about the customers who is doing the deliveries nowadays, is for the 130 packages a day, is looking into, okay, let's start with outsource it. And maybe in the future he will insource it because it's then it's part of his core business. And that's really interesting because if you look to, for example, container terminals, we want to have some inspection of their cranes. Those will always say I will use a drone, a commercial drone operator who will do the inspection because, otherwise I don't fly too often. It will cost me too many time, too many, investments to get all, and also in, in labor with all the training, et cetera. It costs too much to do it by yourself. And then they outsource it. So it's really depending of the, the industry where you're in and the purposes you want drones for, for inspection or delivery or whatever. Because I can also imagine if you have cargo delivery daily, for example, the samples we already talked about, yeah, then it can be very interesting to do it by yourself.

I would assume with the use cases you're describing, there'd be an awful lot of ports that are going to have a lot of drone operations in the future. Or do you see it only in, one or two in Europe, in New York, L.

Some ports are farther, some will just start. If you look to, for example, the biggest one, Hamburg, Antwerp, Rotterdam, looking these kind of operations, they also look into U- space, airspace, or, how, manage the, the, the lower airspace, offering special services as an authority. We're not the only one and every port has its own approach. what, which is good because what you see nowadays, we speak to Antwerp, we speak to Hamburg, and that's very interesting because we say, okay, we do it on our own way. We implement U- space airspace in an operational area. Antwerp has a different approach and we can learn both from both sides. That's very interesting. So what we do nowadays, what we wanted to do is that we are building up our own ecosystem in the Port of Rotterdam. They are doing it as well in Antwerp, Hamburg as well. And we want to connect all those ecosystems and exchange the data, exchange knowledge, and how can we help each other in that. So that is what you see in Europe. Outside of Europe, we also see the same is happening. For example, Singapore is also looking into this kind of operations. We have a good relationship as well with them. And, also looking into how can we help each other? How can we exchange data and knowledge? But the difference on also of the location of the port, the country it is in, what kind of port, industry is there, how far they are with their developments.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of those ports, whether in Europe or Singapore, as you mentioned, which are the most forward leaning, which are, being the most innovative and doing the most interesting things\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a very good question. yeah, Rotterdam is one of, in, in the top five, but, uh, if you look at the approach we have looking into the uSpace airspace, how we develop services for our customers, how we build up the ecosystem, so how we help our customers, and look into their business models to implement these kind of operations. So that's something we don't see a lot in other ports. That's really our frontrunner over there. But if you look at other ports, for example, Antwerp, they already implemented the whole, uSpace, airspace, and also the BVLOS operations. They have five or six drones in the box solutions and can start the operations at any time they want. That's not so far we are yet. So on the other point of view, they're also very far, but sometimes it's very difficult to compare it. So what you can say is that there is sometimes in a port, there is a lot of development going on. And sometimes they just started. They're not so far, so it's not about who is the best, I think, it's how far they are in the implementation and building up the ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there roadblocks that these early innovators have discovered that the rest of the community is thinking about how to work around, or are the ports that are being the most forward leaning, learning on their own and benefiting a lot from it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think, there are some advantages of, and, what we already, for example, if you look to several systems for detecting drones, In Belgium, Antwerp, they have another system than in Hamburg, Singapore, Port of Rotterdam.

So we invite each other as well to look into our kitchen, so to say, and so they can see how we implemented that. So that, and that is very interesting as port, because we also have, they all have the same challenges in implementing this new kind of industry.

But if somebody provided a service, let's say a company standardized what you did and, listened to what your lessons learned and your best practices and the other big ports in Europe and created a service out of this. I would assume there's probably 10 to 20 that would be the best candidates. But why would small ports not even want this service, Niels?

I think the only thing is what you see nowadays in the bigger ports. they also have the capability to invest in these kinds of new solutions. So they are more the front runner. And they can help also the smaller ports in these kind of things. And also the bigger ports are more, they have more complex operations. And if it works over in these kind of ports, you can copy and paste it also in the smaller ports. So that's the very interesting thing. So at the end, I think any ports can copy paste a part of our solutions, not the port of Rotterdam solutions, but the solutions from the, from any port where you're looking into. So I think the opportunity and it's quite big. And, I think there is a lot to do with imports and also looking into how we can implement these kinds of solutions, because it also helps us with the logistics and make it more efficient, more sustainable. we all have the same challenges over there. You always want to be more efficient and sustainable in the future and still want to make money.

You cannot use only radar systems, so you also have to look at, for example, in radio frequency RF solutions, maybe cameras or other solutions. So I think it will be a combination in the future. So what you see is that Antwerp is now using RF solutions. That's very interesting. So we could have a lot of exchange of knowledge. And we're now also starting up one of our own projects to look into that. And it's the same with radar systems. We now are the first one in Europe was doing this.

So what we want to know is who's flying in the air. So that was also one of the reasons we started with the U- space airspace. That brings us also that we have to track the non cooperative drones as well. And, that's what we now do it nowadays. And what you see is that, sometimes it's because people don't know, they're not allowed to fly over there. And sometimes they have other purposes for example, if you look to our own container terminals, we have a lot of, drugs related things that's going on over there. And they also use drones nowadays to get packages from the one side of the fence to the other side of the fence. And then we also have the other side of that's more like the terrorist, thing. We know that we have to invest in these kinds of solutions. And that it's very important to know what is happening in the air. And as a Port Authority, we're only about the detecting. We cannot, do anything about, the next step, get them out of the air. That's something for the police in this case, in our case. So we now also talk to the National Police about, well, we have this kind of data and how can we help you to give the insights of what is happening in our port area. And so that's also very interesting. So there's one topic, which needs, I think, a lot of, attention in the coming years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Niels, thank you for this. this is a new topic for a lot of us because it's, we don't understand port, we understand the drone operations, we understand drone delivery, we understand drone for inspecting things, but to be able to understand the intersection of the drone capability and the ports is really interesting. I'm about to ask you 10 years from now, what are we going to be seeing? And to allow you to think about that, I'm assuming there's a bit of a business opportunity here, for some kind of a service delivery, capability that again takes the best practices of what you're doing in the other European ports and others and that just takes it from port to port and maybe you guys are part of that maybe you're part owner in that but it sounds like there's a real opportunity there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A lot of opportunities is going on. What we also now are doing that we are building up the ecosystem. That is not only done by the port. It's also done by the national authorities. For example, the municipality of Rotterdam, which is close by. We have Rotterdam The Hague Airport. It's close by. We have the province. That's region authority. We have the TU Delft. We several universities. And also research institutions. And what we see is that we have to integrate all those, parties together. And that's the reason we now also started a foundation that's called the DronePort Rotterdam. And from that foundation we really want to get all the knowledge together, work as a one ecosystem. And spread it out. Not only in the Netherlands, but also, international, working with other ports or cities. And that's a great opportunity for us. So we're now focusing a lot of how can we manage it inside of the port, but within a couple of years, I think it's very interesting also to bring our knowledge and experience outside of our port to other ports or cities, which are now facing these kind of challenges. That's, we're now looking in, we're now in, in the phase of, formalize it, the foundation. So that will be there, I think, in a couple of weeks or months. and from that point, we can start also, the cooperation with other, parties.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>if you were to do this all over again, you've been doing it for a couple of years What would you do different?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the differences? What I would do different is that I, start earlier, I think, with how can we make, valuable business models for our customers? How can we facilitate that more?

Can you imagine the airline industry, if everybody was separating themselves, and the only way that they would, change the track as if they got a TCAS warning that says turn right and descend immediately. Same thing in the drone community. Wouldn't be very efficient if you were operating, let's say, drone delivery service and didn't know that somebody else was out there and you're altering your course, multiple times to avoid these other vehicles. I mean, at some point it would be, you'd stretch the system too far. But if the other guy knows there's somebody here and we can figure out a way to share better, I think that makes a lot of sense. This airspace is finite. It's big, but it's finite.

Lorne knows where aviation has been, where it is today and talks about how he believes we're going forward in aviation. You'll enjoy Lorne's overview of the aviation industry, airline operations, the challenges faced by airline operations, and few can tell you better about the opportunities available to our innovators facing not just tomorrow's challenges, but today's opportunities for near term operational optimization. Innovators and their investors should take note. There are so many opportunities for innovators from Lorne's discussion. Starting with where he believes few agree with them on, to the challenges, airlines and airports face today, to the requirements of today's and tomorrow's operators to the challenges and opportunities of air traffic optimization and to the requirements and opportunities for data sharing and coordination in our complex airspace. Something that would be fun to hear what some of today's leaders in traditionally aviation and advanced air mobility discovered from Lorne's discussion and from some of the other conversations with other guests we've had on the podcast that talk about today's aviation challenges and opportunities and how current conditions may or may not impact how drone, drone delivery, UTM and other advanced air mobility OEMs operators and investors think and plan for the future. So with all that said many thanks to Lorne for a terrific discussion and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our discussion with Lorne Cass as you innovate for today's and tomorrow's opportunities in The Vertical Space.

Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think as we talk about new entrants, there may be very few that agree with me that noise will be an issue. I think, generally speaking, there's a thought that the new entrant operations, AAMs, eVTOL, etc., believe that they're much quieter and the public won't have an issue with noise. But I've been in many, many public noise meetings in neighborhoods, and for sure, the mantra today is, If I see you, I hear you. So unless it's done right, the noise people can make it very difficult to grow the market. So I would say noise may be something that people don't really agree with me on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, now, isn't that something now me knowing you a little bit, I'm very well aware that your awareness of community noise and the impact of the community is critical. And most people don't think about it,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right.

We're seeing lots being done with the FAA and several of the new entrant operators, OEMs, and those that intend to operate. I think there are some areas where we've done a good job with communities. But let me just give you an example. I live out in the, in the Phoenix area and there's a particular homeowners association here that, took a vote about six months ago saying there'd be no drone deliveries in our neighborhood. Now, can they just shut that off? No, but when they go to the city council and the state government and eventually the federal government, they will be heard. So I think it's really important for new entrant operators and those that plan to operate in that public arena, to show the benefit and show that they will be a good neighbor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, a lot of OEMs and operators are thinking about noise and doing all they can on the design side, operation side, to minimize the noise footprint. So in what ways is your observation of this topic different in ways that people disagree with you?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I would say mine goes back, of course, to the, the traditional aviation. That's where I've mostly been in these public hearings where they're talking about noise and communities and so forth. But the noise community is strong. And I was at a meeting just two years ago, an FAA sponsored meeting on, The New World of Drones, AAM, and so forth. And there was, this was out in Long Island, and there was a woman there from this noise community association, and she was adamant that I don't want to see you anywhere near my neighborhood. I don't want to see you going overhead. You tell me you're going to be quieter than what I hear today. And she said, I get that. She said, but I don't want you there because if I see you, I'm going to hear you. And that's the first place I heard that. But I've heard it several times since then. I think it's a matter of working with the public to help them understand the value in the service and the product you intend to provide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was just about to ask you about the value and how the perception of value will influence this, conversation around noise. One of the most annoying sounds to me is the noise of the leaf blowers\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, me too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And they are constant, but we accept it because, we get good value out of it. So how do you bring value into the discussion around drone delivery, and especially given that this is something that will benefit everyone, not just, the 10 percent or the 5 percent of the population.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. I think you start with showing the value. So first of all, when I look at initial drone activity and drone value, I see it very much in the first responder arena, medical arena, et cetera. And I think if we can start that off and do it right, which I think there's a lot of good work going on there now. I think the public will start to accept it, and then you can expand into the neighborhood delivery and so forth. I'm sure there are some neighborhoods in the country that would have no issue whatever with drones flying up and down their street in lieu of FedEx or UPS vans doing the same thing. But I do believe it's going to take more outreach than maybe some realize through these local public entities to get people on board and to feel more comfortable with it. It's new and they'll just need to better understand it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, the other thing that I don't think a lot of people appreciate, but when you see the noise abatement offices in the airports around the country, and you see the focus that they have on addressing every single request that comes in.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh my,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I still remember talking to an FAA administrator just a couple years ago, former FAA administrator just a couple years ago. And, there was a question as to some, people in the Boston area objecting to a new procedure for NextGen. I think it was a new PBN or RNAV procedure. And this administrator said there were a couple of people who were complaining in the Boston area about this procedure and it didn't go through.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It doesn't take much.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I don't know if everybody can appreciate the effects of, even though 95 percent of the people think it's the greatest thing. If one or two people complain, a congressman gets a hold of that, it's possible it just won't happen. I mean, is this part of your reason why we have to pay so much attention to noise?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, most definitely. And I mean, there's a good emission story to be told in most cases. I think that's a good thing for the public, but, you've got to do the noise and do it right because it doesn't take much. I lived in Minneapolis for several years, as and the community there is very sensitive to noise. And a lot of things that, most airports should and could do, the Minneapolis airport was unable to do it because of the limitations around the community. And I can't tell you how many properties they had to end up buying in order to operate the airport. Other places? I lived in Dallas for several years. Didn't hear a whole lot of complaints around the airport there. And this is interesting too. The DFW airport specifically, as you recall, was built in the 70s. And it was built out in the middle of nowhere, directly in between Dallas and Fort Worth. There was nobody complaining about noise then. However, today, the communities are built right up to the boundary of the airport. And now they are starting to see noise complaints that they never had in the past. That's relatively new, but I think it, a lot depends on the public, who they are, where they are, what part of the country. this area, Phoenix is generally an area that is sensitive to noise also. The airport has gone through all kinds of gyrations to accommodate the public, in terms of how they fly airplanes in and out of there, and not very efficient routings, to be honest, and that is one thing they've had to live with for years in order to accommodate, the noise concerns of the community. Now, did the airlines pack up and leave and go away and say, nope, we're not flying there because they're all too concerned about noise? No. They did a lot of things, maybe they didn't want to do, maybe they weren't the most cost efficient, but they did it so the public would accept them. And not force them to do things they didn't want to do. So I think noise will be there and I'm not trying to say that's going to be the overriding issue, but I do think noise will be an issue in certain areas. Let me give you one example, by the way, and I would say, don't confuse the noise community and the emissions community, the CO2 emissions community, and I'll give you an example there in San Francisco, there's been a battle going on for many years to reroute departures out of San Francisco and Oakland late at night so that they fly out over the bay and then over the bridge out into the ocean. If they're going to go eastbound, let's say to New York, it adds about 60 or 70 additional flying miles. The noise community was thrilled because they've fought over this for years with the local congressional people in the room with them. Believe me, I was there. They finally implemented this or started the implementation a couple of years ago now. And what do you think happened? The emissions community said, what? You're flying an extra 60 or 70 miles? You know how many more missions that is per flight every day, every night? And so the battle is there. But the noise community was happy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you think that perceptions of noise change over, many years over a long duration of time? Like what was it like when automobiles were first introduced and where people, I'd love to see research on this. Were people complaining about the noise of automobiles because it was a new sound in the environment and that's why they noticed it and their brains didn't filter it out. But now automobiles are just part of the environment. They're part of the background. And. I don't think that we have a commensurate level of noise complaints there. So I wonder in the aviation landscape, have noise perceptions of large aircraft changed over the years will it be a different story with these smaller things like drones? Are we going to get accustomed to them? Is the long term arc of this one of how do we get through the introduction of this and see people, start to get accustomed to it and see how the noise response behavior changes over that time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:43\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's that. I think it will take time. I've been around a long time. I wasn't around when automobiles first showed up. But I was certainly around when there were a lot of noisy jets that were flying around, really noisy jets as compared to today. And people did complain, but it was all in the way you looked at it as well. Obviously, for those of you that ever been to a military, air facility, often you would see signs that said, it's the sound of freedom. I know we're noisy, but it's the sound of freedom. When I lived in Minneapolis, my neighbor would complain to me about all the noisy DC 9s flying over our house. And I would always say to him, tongue in cheek, that's the sound of my paycheck. I like it. So, I think it's definitely in the perception. I do believe that I'll just say the airline industry in general, heavy transport aircraft, have done a great job of reducing the noise, but the noise community, the serious noise community, is still out there and still complaining and just doesn't want anything near their house.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And can have an outsized impact on the FAA and different organizations with just a couple of complaints.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most definitely. And when you get, when you're at the FAA and you get letters from mostly from folks in Congress that are closer to their communities, they mean something. And I've been in two or three different meetings where the local congressional delegation or the congressman or congresswoman themselves were in the room and the FAA had to be responsive. And so did the airport authorities that were in the room as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What have you seen as most efficient strategies in the way that airlines dealt with community, on the topic of noise, that something that maybe the drone world can learn from?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think it was a combination of not just the operator, but it was also finding community leaders that recognize the value to the community and whether it was a, like I said, a first responder value or a value in terms of delivering goods and services more efficiently, there's questions about the roads. I mean, obviously traffic is not getting any better. So there are things like that I think that can be used, but in, in the airline world, in a lot of cases, it would be the airlines getting together with airport authorities, which are important and have a lot of community members in them, and working to see what's the best approach to the community, having meetings with the community are very round table noise meetings, and a lot of these airports are important. I think the, future operations to and from airports will already have a start in that area in terms of if you're going to fly a eVTOL or whatever, I think that's, you're going to have a good start because they're already going to have some mechanism for doing that. If you're going to fly to the, a vertiport that's downtown, whether it's on top of a building or someplace downtown or out in the sticks in an area that has not typically had, I'll put this in quotes, aircraft around it, I think you're going to have to go out, find the local community leaders, introduce yourself, and say, we want to be a good community member, participate and show the value of what we deliver. I think it's really important to get those people in the room as quickly as you can.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, terrific. all stemming from what those things that people don't agree with you on, Tell us a little bit about, you have years of experience in the airline industry. Give us an overview of the industry, based on your experience and also that the evolution of technology during that time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the technology has evolved quite a bit. I mean, when I started in the industry, the very first airline I worked for was a very small airline that operated DC 6s and Lockheed Electras. And that Electra was leap years ahead of the DC 6 in terms of how fast it could go, where it could go, and so forth. And of course now today we're flying much more modern transports. They get from A to B much quicker. They are much more reliable than it used to be. When you think of reciprocating, aircraft engines and the reliability, I mean, they were reliable, but they required tons and tons of maintenance. Lots of moving parts, literally. And so that has improved, dramatically. The aircraft themselves have improved dramatically. In terms of managing them from an ops control perspective, and operations for an airline, the technology has moved very much away from, literally teletype. Teletype was around in sending messages on aircraft movements in many places until just 10, maybe 15 years ago at the most. Still there. obviously when we were able to send messages more directly using computers and email and so forth, that changed it. The tracking mechanisms for the aircraft, it used to be when the aircraft took off, the pilot knew exactly where he was. The dispatcher was tracking him just like air traffic control in many cases did by manual position reports given by radio. Can you imagine that today? That still happens over some of the long transatlantic flights and so forth. So I would say, and something you've been involved with certainly Jim, is surveillance. When we first talked some many years ago, all I wanted from the product you had, I wanted to know where my airplanes were. It was important to me. It was important to me to be able to be more efficient in figuring out if the guy that was number 10 in holding, if I wanted to get him out of holding first by coordinating with ATC. But in the past, I wouldn't know and he wouldn't know. He wouldn't know if he was number one or number 21 in a holding stack, for example. So I think the knowing where the aircraft are and what they're doing, the data that are exchanged, is huge. The data that's exchanged in terms of the efficiency of the airspace operation is also huge. So almost 30 years ago now, the FAA and industry, airline industry, got together and talked about, well, what if we exchange data? So we better understand we have more accurate, more predictable times. So for example, if a, American flight 123 is scheduled to depart at 0800, but the airline knows because of a passenger connection issue or crew issue or whatever it is, it's really not going to depart till 0845, there was really no good way to pass that along. You had about this two hour window around your proposed time, but then came along collaborative decision making out of this where we started to exchange some of those things. So you can imagine, initially, when we, the airline community, were working with the FAA and there were three airlines that started this off, exchanging very basic data with the FAA, and they would in turn sort of exchange it with the other participants, so you'd have a better picture of what was going on at LaGuardia, what was going on at Minneapolis, what was going on in Dallas. And this collaborative decision making effort came out of that. Now, I can promise you, in the first few years of, it's called CDM, in the late 90s, going and telling my boss that we were going to share information, and I put that in quotes, with for example, our competitor United Airlines or Delta Airlines, that didn't go over very well. What? No, we're not. We're not sharing it. We're not telling them what we're doing. But when you work through it and understand if everybody, gives better information, more accurate information on what they're actually doing today and when they intend to operate. Whether this is an airline, by the way, or general aviation, business aviation primarily, it makes a huge difference for the entire, national airspace in terms of operating more efficiently. So, I would say today it's about, I'll call it surveillance for a loose term. where is my airplane right now? I also want to know where it's predicted to go. We can do that with some of these tools. But I also want to be able to exchange the appropriate data very quickly and very reliably, in order to improve the operation for everybody. And that's coming more and more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you think about the introduction of the new vehicles, and you think about data sharing, what kind of advice would you give to them that, things that they're going to have to anticipate that they may not be thinking about today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think it's important to understand that. So I have heard a few new vehicle type operators, and I would say this is primarily among the drone community say things like, we'll just separate ourself. Okay. I think that's probably possible. However, once you start operating in airspace where there are other operators, and if they're also saying, well, we'll just separate ourselves, and there's a third operator, so we'll just separate ourselves, at some point, you're not going to be separating yourself. So there's really going to be a need to exchange that data, track data, intent data, and so forth, so we can all live together more efficiently. Can you imagine the airline industry, if everybody was separating themselves, and the only way that they would, change the track as if they got a TCAS warning that says turn right and descend immediately. Same thing in the drone community. Wouldn't be very efficient. If you were operating, let's say, drone delivery service and didn't know that somebody else was out there and you're altering your course, multiple times to avoid these other vehicles. I mean, at some point it would be, you'd stretch the system too far. So, but if the other guy knows there's somebody here and we can figure out a way to share better, I think that makes a lot of sense. This airspace is finite. It's big, but it's finite. And we have to figure out a way to share it with everybody in a much more flexible, much more dynamic way..\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So to that end, we want to talk about airline operations just a minute with your deep experience there. So we're obviously seeing a lot of growth, a lot of demand in the airline and the air travel area. How do we bring capacity to the system to account for that continued growth?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think first of all, there's a lot of fingers that are pointed at the FAA for not being quick enough to move forward. I think there is some truth to that. However, they have masters that work up on that big hill in DC and respectfully work for them. And a lot of times programs that they have underway are, interrupted. Not purposefully, but interrupted by deliberations on the Hill that could have nothing to do with that particular program, but affects the, I'll just say the stable flow of, the financing for the FAA. So I think the number one thing we have to do is make sure that the FAA stays as the, the entity it's been for years as the North Star for safety and efficiency for the world airspace, if you will. And I think a lot of that's going to really depend on finding a way to ensure they have a stable funding mechanisms. And I think you probably heard that from my good friend, Mr. Rinaldi, who you talked to a few months ago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Lorne, can you talk a little bit more, in some greater level of detail, when we look back at how technology helped accommodate increasing demand, on the national airspace system, how that was, how that achieved, whether through, greater surveillance or better management of the traffic, various technologies along the way. And then, projecting into the next couple of decades where people forecast the doubling of air traffic, how will that be accommodated? Any particular technologies that you're excited about or see the potential in?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think there are a lot of technologies that are coming to bear, just not quick enough. So for example, I'll the FAA's communication system between facilities and so forth is still today, largely a wired system and the facilities that the FAA uses in the U.S. I'm gonna use that as an example. If you think of the number of centers, there are about 20 centers in the United States, and they date back to the cold war. And when decentralized facilities was, seemed a very good thing, because if there was some sort of an attack in one place, not the other, you could still have these decentralized, these places that could sustain on their own without having to be connected to anything else, but the world has changed dramatically from then and the, the way data can move is moving and is moving towards is in a much different fashion. And the FAA is trying to move there, but it's not easy. And remember, they are very concerned about the reliability and redundancy of any system they deploy because, they're protecting airspace and they're protecting vehicles from running into each other and loss of life. So they're very keen on their number one goal, which is safety. Efficiency is secondary, but once we do a better job of exchanging these data and surveilling the airspace, and the surveillance has improved dramatically, when I started as an air traffic controller many years ago, there wasn't a digitized target. So when I saw a target on my radar, what I saw was a target, if you will, a blip as people like to say, but I saw a target. And I had to, in my head, know who that was. And I had to know what I was doing with the airplane, what its speed was, what altitude, and so forth. In the mid 70s, in the center environment, they came forward with digitized radar, which for the first time used multiple radar sites feeding into a digitizer, and actually created a target on a radar screen. And I could see the identity of the aircraft, destination, type of aircraft, speed, altitude, etc. That was a huge leap forward in surveillance. That same sort of surveillance is still there today. It's still overlaid, so all these systems overlay into one or another, so I can use four or five radar systems to get a much more accurate picture of where the aircraft is going. I can use GPS as well, So I, I have much, much better, much more accurate surveillance. Communication systems with the airplanes, from the ground to the airplane are slowly changing, and, the controller pilot data link system is coming on board now and it's, I would say, in the center environment, it'll be out there over the next five years or so. I think most of the centers will be in the CPDLC environment. Many of them are already there and moving there. And that will make a difference because that will help with, I'll call it, routine communications. So when you're passing from one center to another, rather than the controller saying, clean the mic and saying, Delta 126, contact New York Center on 12345. Have a nice day. And then the pilot coming back and saying, Delta 1 2 3, we'll do the same, see you, bye bye. it'll be sent digitized, like a text message. like they get, they've had for years with ACARS. ACARS from ARINC has been in airplane cockpits for many years. And airlines have been able to communicate with their aircraft using digital messaging. But air traffic control has not. So that type of thing is going to make a huge difference. As well as tools that, for the future, are going to do a much better job of not only saying here's where we are, but here's where things are going, and I'm talking about in real time. So more predictive information around tracks. We've already had, in the last 10 or 15 years, the ability for these conflict probes using this digitized radar to look out for a controller, let's say that's working in Denver Center, and say, hey, if you don't do something, United 123 and Delta 425 are going to have a problem up here in 20 miles or so. And the controller could then take some sort of corrective action to change the track or the altitude on one or the other. So those things are getting more and more efficient. I think in the future, and there's some of this already going on, we need to do a better job of collecting data every day, for every operation, whether it's a bad weather operation or it's a perfectly beautiful day, and pull that all in and analyze it. And then use what I see as a value of future AI in the future for air traffic control, for example, is then learning from the last event we had and make sure we don't do something that gave us a problem on the last event in the next event, and doing that fairly quickly. I'm a little bit, I hear some people talking about, AI should be, the first thing out there in terms of safety, but I think we need to wait until it proves itself before we have it being the primary safety tool. That's my own thought. So really, that's I hope that sort of answered your question. I think where we've come from is good. Where we're going is good. Getting there in between is difficult. When NextGen was first announced by Russ Chew back in, what, 2005 or so, One of the problems with NextGen is they got a name called NextGen and everybody expected on January 1st, 2020, everything was going to be fixed. It just doesn't work quite that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there lessons from the rollout of CPDLC that, help inform what our expectations should be for the rate of adoption of these other\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>things. Well, I can't speak to all the issues with CPDLC, but I can tell you, I'll give you an example. So the gent I just mentioned, Russ Chew, came from American Airlines before he went to the FAA, and American was very heavily involved in Miami Center, in testing CPDLC on a number of aircraft with the FAA. And he was a very strong supporter of CPDLC and what it did. He then was at the FAA and a couple of years later realized that the FAA simply did not have the funding available to roll out this capability. I think they were originally planning it three or four centers along the East Coast and he had to put, he didn't put the program on hold, but he had to stretch it out a lot farther. And again, that kind of goes back to, do they have a stable funding mechanism that allows them to react to these things and keep things moving forward rather than be sidelined for a while. The FAA many times on these programs when we have a government shutdowns or whatever, they have to stop everything they're doing. And imagine if they had a program that had two prime contractors and maybe 30 subcontractors. All of that work stops. So if I'm a little subcontractor with 10 people and my funding is stopped and I have no idea when it's coming back, I may in fact have to lay off people. And maybe some of those are really critical people. And when we start up again in three or four or five or six months. That person I let go that I really needed is working for somebody else or gone someplace else. So you can imagine how it, the, the pile on effect that occurs and CPDLC, I think was caught with that because it was very promising. And it's taken many years longer than originally thought to get it out there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, Let's talk a little bit about airline operations. Tell us, what's the goal? What's the impact on the airline, its financials? Tell us how an airline operation runs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So let's talk about what's important to the airline. First of all, they provide a customer service. And they're in business to make a profit, like any company that's in business. First of all, they have to develop a schedule. It's going to be a scheduled operation, which most of them are scheduled operations. And they have to be able to deliver safe and reliable service. And those are the key things. So if you think about an operations control center, they are in fact responsible for that day to day operation of the airline in real time. And things change in real time. And I would say to any new operator that plans to be out there in this world, that you can plan on something happening you never expected in a million years will happen. And you have to be prepared to react and prepare for it and so forth. But for an Ops Control Center, the most important thing is safe, efficient, reliable, and obviously financially sound operations. So what they're going to look at in most cases, their key metrics are completion factor. That means how many flights did I cancel or hopefully none. My departure performance, let's just call it on time performance. So departure performance for most airlines, they measure it from what they call D0. D0 simply means Departing on Schedule. My schedule said I was going to depart at 13. 05. I departed at 1305. Not 13. 07, not 13. 20. D0 performance. Then, obviously, arrival performance, because that's really important to the airline, as well as to that customer. The customer may be going to a meeting that day, may be going to visit, Aunt Sally, or may be trying to make a connection at that airport, so that arrival time is very important. And that's one of the metrics, of course, that's critically important to the DOT when they're providing overview. And then, of course, they need to look at their, what they call their block time performance. In other words, if they planned that this flight from Detroit to Denver was going to take two hours and one minute, how reliable are they? If that's what they planned in their schedule planning, how good are they at hitting that two hours and one minute? So they measure that in what they call block time performance. And You don't want your block time performance to be too high because you're paying everybody involved, that airplane crew and everything else, based on what you show as the planned block time or anything over that. So let's just say that if you plan two hours on that stretch and every day you are actually flying in an hour and a half, it's costing you that additional 30 minutes for just, let's just say the crew time, as well as over the course of a day, if your block time performance is too high, you are wasting an aircraft by the end of the day. So if it was 30 minutes on every leg and that airplane flew, let's say eight legs, you might've been able to fly another complete flight with that airplane. So how good did you plan the performance of that airplane? So the advanced planning, and then obviously the post ops analysis are critical for some of the reasons we mentioned earlier, let's look at what we did yesterday and see if we can do this better tomorrow. Does that make sense?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:43\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It does two things real quickly. One is, if you know it only takes 90 minutes to fly, why is your block just not 90 minutes every day?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think because there are some days where it might take you, if it's a two hour block, there might be some days where you take two hours and 14 minutes, or two hours and 22 minutes, particularly on a busy route that has a lot of, I'll just say, uncertainties around ATC or other issues. So you may pad that block because you know In order to get that A14, that you want, the on time arrival, you may need to pad that a little bit so that you can be more assured that you're going to hit that A14. Now, if you look at today, in my view, if I look at airline block times today, they are much higher, than they were, let's say 15, 20 years ago, because the system is not able to support some of the level of demand that's out there. And, airline CEOs are much more cognizant of the focus on airline cancellations and on time performance. So they, sometimes they'll pad that block, but it costs them money to pad it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now I understand that some level of, padding or sandbagging of this block time is necessary, but what would it take for the entire system to get more lean as it relates to block time? Is that even possible?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is it impossible? No. I think it just depends on where the focus is, and the focus seems to change now and again. I think as we get more efficient with using airspace and some of these new capabilities and technologies come along, I think, the block time will automatically start shrinking down to a more acceptable level. I can tell you that I worked for one boss at, at an airline, a large airline. Jim's familiar with it, that he wanted block time to be at somewhere around 65%. That's low. Today, when I look at block\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Explain 65\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in other words, 65 percent of the time is acceptable. in reaching that two hour block, if that's what I had planned, rather than 85 percent of the time, because it's cheaper. And again, I'm not a guy that builds block times and I'm not familiar with every single thing that goes into them, but a lot of it has to do with crew, aircraft, where's that airplane going to be, the lines of flying that they build, and so forth. Today, I would say I see several airlines that are at least 10 points above that, which is a lot. And some of them that are actually in the 80s, which means maybe they planned a day that they expected they were going to be, because of the time of year, the time of week or whatever it was, that there were going to be typically a lot of delays and none of them materialized. So all of a sudden their block performance goes up dramatically. A lot of the block padding has to do with, I think, in my humble opinion, and the inefficiencies in the operations today. Hopefully we can improve in the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if somebody comes and pitched you a better way of, predicting off block time or just broadly improving on time performance, how would you evaluate this technology? How big of a lift would it be to, include that in the entire, sausage making machine for lack of better analogy to actually make an impact at the end of the day?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I can tell you, I had a lot of people in my office over the years that had this great idea that was going to be, that was going to solve all my problems. Usually it was one thing that was going to fix everything. I'll say this first, what I found sometimes, many times is whomever and whatever they were trying to sell, they weren't asking me what I needed. They were telling me what they thought I needed. So, I think that's one thing that a lot of companies, and there are lots of good things going on out there today in order to improve the operation in real time and take shortcuts and routes and so forth. some of those are all good things. Any little minute or two you can save here and there is really important. Other things happen to be, can we do a better job of predicting weather? Many years ago, I had somebody from a very large company with a very large weather service that came in and told me they could give me 48 hours notice as to when a thunderstorm would impact one of my, the outer arrival fixes, let's say to this big airport. And I was pretty certain that was not possible. We did it a test for a summer. And it was not even close to possible. I said, if you can predict that four hours in advance, I'd be happy, much less 48 hours. So, I think that it's, it is about data. There is a lot of work going on today in terms of collecting data and then presenting it to an airline in a usable form. There are a couple of airlines, including one I'm quite familiar with that have done a lot of really good in house work and understanding and evaluating in real time what's going on with the operation and what's the best way to react to it. For example, if there's a big weather event that goes through, I'll just say DFW, and they have 70 diversions, all right, in the past, maybe it was just, okay, we got to get those airplanes back. There was not a lot of thought put to prioritizing getting those airplanes back, other than sort of from seat of the pants, this dispatcher or this ops coordinator knows that this particular flight's got 80 connections. And all that occurred, but that occurred in a manual fashion. Today, there are technologies that are pulling all those data together and then saying, here's how you should recover these diversions, if that makes sense to you, but that type of thing, we need to get better at doing that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>39:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned something very interesting that nobody really asked you what you needed. At the time, what are some of the things that you needed then? And importantly, what are some of the things that the industry needs today? What are some of the main frustrations when it comes to running airline operations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Predictability really is the number one thing. So whether it's an internal, first of all, you have to really understand the condition of the airline internally as an airline. What's going on with my aircraft, technical issues, airport issues, crew issues, spare aircraft issues, because all of those things ultimately are going to impact my customer. And at the end of the day, my customer is what impacts my bottom line. So those are the things internally I have to know. Externally, I have to have a much better idea, and much more predictability for what is happening today in this airspace system in which we're going to operate. Because once I get the wheels in the well of an airplane, it's out of my hands. There's a lot of other people involved. Obviously the crew are involved. I promise you that the dispatchers in these big airline ops centers, are coordinating with the crews and giving them updates, real time information for something that's going to occur three or four hundred miles in front of them. So there's a lot of good exchange of information that's going along. In terms of that, trying to pull all that together with all the operators that are out there that are, relying on this same airspace, this very finite airspace, we need to share as much information as possible so we can all use it most efficiently. And that includes, by the way, the military, who I have a great deal of respect for the military, and of course their missions are changing, but they have a tremendous amount of airspace that they use every day for training and so forth and sometimes it's available, but the FAA and operators, don't know it's available. So if you could imagine, if you're flying from Dallas to Los Angeles, you go right through New Mexico where the White Sands Missile Range is located. There's an airway that goes right through the middle of White Sands Missile Range, and it's usually closed because there's something going on in White Sands Missile Range that they don't want you flying directly over it. So that means you either have to go to the south, around the very south end of the White Sands Missile Range, which means you're over El Paso, or roughly over the north end, which means you're over Albuquerque. So that adds extra time and fuel and CO2 emissions that may not be necessary if you only knew that J65, was actually available and you could have flown through there. Now there's a lot of work in that area to make it more dynamic and predictable and improving the data exchange between DOD and FAA. So that they each know, they have a much better idea of when this airspace is going to be available, making it more flexible and usable. So others can use it, but we're still not there. Predicting what's going to happen is really important. So I can understand, like I said, from the very beginning, I can predict what is going to impact this particular flight, but I also need to understand what may be impacting the FAA and what may cause me an issue farther down the line. I also have to have a very close eye on my customers and what I'm doing or not doing that can impact them. But it's still at the top of the list would be give me data that I can use to make my operation more predictable. And predictable doesn't mean that I'm going to depart every day on my schedule at 0800. It means that I know that I'm going to have to factor in a delay of 23 minutes for that flight. As early as possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When it comes to dealing with unexpected circumstances, whether this is weather, rerouting, ground delays, or any number of things, and somewhere I've heard that about 15 percent of total fuel is wasted on these kinds of inefficiencies, but dealing with these inefficiencies, is that currently done mostly by human expertise, intuition, or to what extent is technology being used? And, certainly some things on the horizon that you're excited about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I would say, yes, it has been mostly done by human experience, intuition, and so forth. That has been changing, and it's a changing for the better. And as more information are available to these humans, more data are available, I think that's going to improve that efficiency. You are right about the amount of fuel that's carried. Let me give you an example. Go back to that military airspace. Let's say I was planning a flight from Dallas to Los Angeles, and I knew the J 65 would be open. I wouldn't have to put that additional fuel on that airplane which would allow it to fly around the corner on the north or south end, for example, of White Sands. Even if I'm in route already and carrying this additional fuel, I can save some. If they open it up while I'm flying, I can go through there. But, the reason it's important to know ahead of time, in that case, and there's where some of this technology today, and some of the data that our exchange are going to be exchanged in the future, I hope, between DoD and FAA, will allow me to plan that from the very start, because in some cases, if I'm on a route, let's just say around a weather area or military area, whatever it is, it's a long reroute around that area, and I have to put extra fuel on the airplane to do that, and then somehow when I'm, I get the wheels in while I'm flying, and the controller says, oh guess what, that area's opened up now, you can go direct to Miami. And I take a direct route, in some cases, I have to go into holding and dump, if I can, most airplanes can't these days, or burn off fuel to get down to the landing weight because I could actually be over my maximum landing weight because I have too much fuel on the airplane. So predictability there, again, is a key. If I knew that ahead of time, it wouldn't have been a problem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, you said something about the FAA, knowing about the intentions, the behavior of the FAA, what is it, why is that important and what kind of information do you need and what needs are there that potentially could be met by technology firms?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think there's already some technology firms that are helping them meet that and I think there are technology firms that are helping airlines and operators better understand what may or may not happen. It starts in many cases because weather is usually one of the biggest things that impacts the throughput in a given chunk of airspace. I think the forecasts are getting better and options are getting better. I think there are several small companies that are really good at pulling this together, aggregating all these data and presenting it in a way to an airline that they can better understand it, I think in some cases, and this is why the CDM is so good. Because. As I said, a lot of the dialogue around what we're going to do today in the NAS occurs every two hours with a phone call between airline operation centers, NBAA also has a desk that stays involved. AOPA has a desk to better understand, what's going on. But there's an exchange of information there as well. Some years ago, when I was at Northwest Airlines, Northwest had a very well known and well thought of meteorology department. Not everybody had one, but I'm just using them as an example because I was there. And often, our FAA colleagues at the FAA Command Center would ask the Northwest Airlines meteorologists for what their prediction was for weather in a certain area to compare that with what the FAA had received from NWS and then, try to pull those things together and come up with a good plan. And that's not just, I'm saying it wasn't just that airline, there's other airlines that have their own meteorologists, bigger airlines do that was an exchange of information. It was very good. But I think there are small companies, as I said, some of them that are looking out today and working with airlines, two or three airlines have contracts with some of these folks to help them better plan a route of flight based on what they know, at least at that time, prior to departure that they can plan a better route, and then when they're in route, to help them find a few shortcuts here and there. Save 10 miles here, 10 miles there, because some constraint that was there, be it weather or otherwise, traffic management initiative, for example, didn't materialize, and they can save a few minutes. Minutes is fuel is cost, and fuel burn is obviously emissions, which are critically I would say a lot of folks, by the way, and I've even suggested to some of these small companies, for years up until pretty recently, they would talk about fuel burn and fuel cost savings. And they're certainly there. But today you really need to work right into that first sentence when you're selling green. This is, it has an emissions benefit because it does, fewer emissions. If every minute you don't have that engine burning is obviously fewer emissions. So that's important.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, when thinking about, ways to improve throughput in the National Airspace System, spacing of aircraft comes to mind. Can you talk about, how spacing is done today, and what the main limiting factors are? And ways that can be improved in the future. One thing that comes to mind is voice based communication. The, throughput limits on that channel, and all of the limitations associated with it are compensated in, among other ways in spacing out aircraft, perhaps more than it might be possible. So to what extent is that limiting the spacing and how do you see technology improving that aspect of operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think technology, in my humble opinion, could have already improved some of that over time. So, I'll give you an example. I mentioned before that many years ago when the center environment went from these single site broadband radars that looked out 200 miles each, and the farther away you got from the antenna, the bigger the target got, and all those kind of things. So, in the in route environment, five miles separation between aircraft, was always the mantra. That was the requirement, 5 miles. Because of the fact that you could get so far away from the antenna, the target would actually grow in size the farther you got. When the digitized radar came along, all of a sudden you had a target that was always one uniform size, and it was fed by multiple radar sites. So it was a pretty accurate positioning of that target. There was a discussion at that time in reducing that separation to three miles, but it didn't happen. And, in the terminal area where there's a single radar site and it's looking out 40 miles and not 200 miles and turning at a much faster rate that three mile separation has also been there for some period of time. Now there, there is work going on today, not to reduce separation, but to use tools on the aircraft, for example, to do a better job of managing the spacing. So that if I'm looking at the airplane in front of me and I'm in the following aircraft and I can see who it is, where they are, what their speed is and so forth. And I'm needing to maintain separation there. I might be able to do that. I'm not separating myself. I'm managing the interval. And that's important because when you start saying to a controller or even to a pilot that you're going to, and I'll use these words loosely, self separate, that's not a good thing because then, it comes down to one of the things we'll talk about at some point, who's actually responsible if something goes wrong, responsible, who has the authority, who's going to be held accountable. But the good news about this interval management, which is being tested in two or three places, is very promising. This interval management may help us reduce the separation, and I'm talking now about longitudinal separation, obviously, between aircraft. Vertical separation, which is essentially 1, 000 feet between aircraft, until, I guess it's 20 years ago now, hard to believe, until reduced vertical separation minima came about. When you were above about 30, 000 feet, you had to be separated by 2, 000 foot intervals. Below that was a thousand, and that changed to a thousand feet, and there was a lot of concern about it at the time, but it worked very well, and that was that was based on better equipment in the aircraft, more accurate altimetry, and so forth. So I do think that this, interval management work that's going on is probably going to help us at some point get to reduced spacing between aircraft longitudinally.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, let's, I want to, in a few minutes, we want to start talking about, how you evaluate technology firms that come to you. Oh, you've already mentioned one is. first ask what the airline is looking for rather than just telling about your capabilities. But let's say you just, you gave us an overview of the airline, you gave us an overview of the airline operation. You talked about the complexities, you talked about the importance of predicting, What's going to happen, which runs a better operation. So let's now say we have 10 or 15 new entrants in the market 5 10 years from now. Let's say eVTOL. Let's say you have drone air delivery operations at, Dallas and a lot of different locations. And given your experience in operations, what are some of the things that excite you and what are some of the things that concern you and what advice would you give to somebody who is running those operations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First of all, I would say that, first and foremost, I would say that it's very important, that they understand the FAA role, and I think it's important that they understand that the FAA is, many different divisions and departments and so forth. and I know for example, at one point a CEO made a comment, to an individual that I know, that said, well, this is two years ago now by the way, it's not recent. Two years ago he said. Well, we talked to the FAA and they really like our concept, so we don't see any problem. And the question back to that CEO at the time was, which FAA did you talk to? And he was a little bit taken aback by that. And the comment was, look, Who, anyway, they talked through this and determined that it was somebody in the FAA certification office. And so he was told, well, the certification person is looking at your vehicle and saying, does it look like it can fly? And from what he or she saw, yeah, it looks like it'll fly. But there are many more steps, seven or eight more steps, to you actually are in a position where you have a vehicle and you have a paying customer on board that vehicle, most especially. So I think it's, I would say that's one thing to try to better understand the FAA and how they work and so forth. And I think there's some of the new entrants that are out there, I think are doing a pretty darn good job of that and are pretty well known in the FAA headquarters building and the FAA arena. Others probably could do a little more in that area, but I think they have to think about for the future, let's say eVTOL operator, or AAM operator. They have to think about, the vehicle, they have to think about its limitations. They have to think about, how do they track what it's doing? How do they operate it in real time? If it's a network they're operating, once they have two or three vehicles out there operating, and something happens with one of the vehicles where it can't operate, how are they going to, what are their contingencies for doing that? What are the, what kind of redundancy do they have built in? And I think there's a lot of that needs to, needs to occur with the new operators.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Lorne, when it comes to, technologies that people use in, airline operation centers and broadly in, those corner of airlines that are involved in running the operation, ensuring a smooth operation, how often do the technologies there get updated? And when we think about the innovators in our audience, the entrepreneurs, what are the best pathways for new technologies to get in there and be adopted?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think first of all, you have to visit and you have to see and understand what these airline operation centers do, how they work and so forth. I think that, they also need to understand the airline's customer. And I think they're, everybody's flown somewhere. So you know what it's like to be a passenger on an airplane, The airlines probably have some prioritization of customers. You're going to have certain customers that travel often expect something a little bit higher than others so I think understanding the airline customer will be good going and actually sitting in one of these airline operation centers. Don't go in and say, I have a great idea. go in there and say, I'd like to learn more about your business, because I think I have some ideas that might be helpful in the future, There needs to be a little more of a merging and not just at the commercial level, because a lot of the new operators are working with airlines in the commercial level, and that's really good. And I'm talking about in the chief commercial officer and that kind of arena, that's good. But if you're talking about actually operating your network, I think you need to make sure that you take that if you've got that connection and get it over so you can watch and see how an airline operates every day. And depending on what you plan to do in the future, if you may be operating under, say, Part 135, and you may be carrying four or six or whatever it is, passengers, the FAA is going to require you provide, I'll put it in quotes here, but it's important, operational control. of your aircraft and your network as you operate it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in your experience, how often is new technology introduced?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, that's a hard question. There's been a ton of new technology that's been introduced over the years. I can tell you that some of the technology, let me just use flight planning systems that airlines use, are only recently within the last two or three years, starting to update and do a better job and pull in more data, than they have in the past. So the foundational airline operating systems that have flight planning capabilities, probably go back to the late 70s. I mean, to the mainframe period. And again, I'm not somebody who built original ones, but I can tell you they, they work. They're reliable. They did not give me efficient flight plans. And a lot of times, dispatchers that work in airline operation centers, and dispatchers, by the way, are the ones that actually produce the plan for each individual flight. And with the captain they both have to sign off on that flight. They both go through the flight plan and they both agree, yep, this is a safe operation, we can do this, and they both sign it. So they have joint responsibility for operational control of that flight. The flight planning systems and the routes that are available today, in some cases, the flight planning systems of old can't really file the most efficient routes without a tremendous amount of manual intervention by a dispatcher to quote unquote build a route. Some of the newer systems, and there are a couple that, in this country and a couple from abroad, that do a much better job of smoothing that and finding a more efficient route and being able to flight plan that more efficient route. That the aircraft FMS can operate and understand. There are efficiencies that are out there today in the NAS and globally for more efficient routes that some flight planning systems simply can't do. So that's moving forward. The other thing is there are larger needs for the, I'll call it the, operation of the airline in real time, other things that tools have helped with, and I'm talking about with, for example, crew. Where are my crew? What are my limitations on my crew? Where are my airplanes? Okay, this airplane is flying six segments today, and it's going to have maintenance, so I'm going to have to plan that. All that in the past has been done. Sometime in the past, this is quite a while ago, that was plotted on a plot board, like you see on an aircraft carrier maybe or something. Those are now highly automated, or much more automated than they were in the past. They need to get a little bit better and those are the kinds of things that airlines, I promise you, are interested in. Some are, as I said, doing a lot of good work in house. Others are going to third parties to help them build these systems, but they're looking for a way to better understand. They want the whole picture, so they want to understand weather forecasts. They want to understand, what's the best planned departure time, even if my schedule says 0800. What kind of gate availability do I have? What kind of crew availability do I have? What kind of customer connections How about the ATC demand and capacity I see out there? What about IROPS recovery if I need it? And then how do I plan for the FAA's traffic management initiatives and getting the information in the right way? The FAA provides a warehouse called System Wide Information Management, where it's a data warehouse. that's available for airlines to use. Some airlines can't use it efficiently. They can only get a little information. So there are small companies that are coming out and helping the FAA to better use those data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, I, let's make a little bit of a shift to something you just brought up as it relates to demand and capacity and let's talk a little bit about the choke points. We've discussed it in some of our recent podcasts. Give a sense for where you see the choke points today in the world and what's being done about those choke points? So first, where are they? And two, what are we doing about it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mean other than New York?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is there anything other than New York, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, New York obviously is a very complex chunk of airspace. It has been, for many years now. You've got three major airports there that are all very busy in terms of commercial operations and then you have a couple or two or three of the, I'll call them smaller business or general aviation airports, but they are very busy. The airspace is compact and extremely complex. The people that work there in terms of the FAA and the controllers and so forth really deserve a pat on the back for what they do every single day because that is one tough nugget in terms of a complexity of the operation. So if you have a disruption, whether it's weather or a runway closure you didn't expect, or something else, I mean it backs up the system very quickly. I saw a depiction a few years ago that was done by MITRE, and it was of an airplane that flew from, I think it was flying from Chicago to Newark, and as it approached Newark, the runway closed, and it had to go into holding, and that meant the airplane behind that one, also had to go into holding. And that meant the next airplane had to go into holding. And then it backed up across from the New York Center into the Cleveland Center, where the New York Center controller says, hey, I can't take anymore, I got all these airplanes going into holding, because I had this runway issue. And so Cleveland Center starts holding airplanes. And then at a certain point, Cleveland Center backs up and says to Chicago Center, hey, you've got to hold airplanes. So before you knew it, holding, within about a 40 minute period, backed up from New York all the way to Minneapolis Center, and in fact, the runway closure, opened again in about, I think it was about 30 minutes, maybe a little bit less, but it caused that backup that quickly. So, it's a huge choke point, and there are so many airplanes in the airspace, there's only so many places you can go with them. The other thing is, because of the complexity of the airspace itself, the New York approach control, if you will, that, handles all the airports close in, has above it New York Center, which handles airplanes from say, let's say 18, 000 and above. And then to the north, you have Boston Center. To the west, you have Cleveland Center. To the south, you have Washington Center. All the movement of aircraft that have to move because of weather or whatever, it requires coordination with all those facilities. So imagine today, how many phone calls it takes between those facilities to coordinate just some of those simple moves. So I would say New York is still very complex and a hiccup can cause a lot of problems in a hurry and it's understandable. And the people that work there in those facilities, the controllers I'm talking about and at those airports, they have their hands full every day with a lot of traffic and a lot of things that one hiccup can really back up things quickly. Other choke points that I see today, of course, you've read about the Florida issues that are occurring. part of that has been blamed on, on controller staffing, particularly at the Jacksonville Center. I do think that is a factor. But I also think just the general demand into Florida, and the fact that it's a peninsula and offshore of Florida and to the Northeast and to the Northwest are big military training areas. And the fact you have Cuba right to the South. So it's really a limited chunk of airspace to move a lot of airplanes. And if you have any sort of hiccup, like thunderstorms do occur in Florida, it really backs things up very quickly. In the growth. In traffic, their growth of air carrier traffic, as well as general aviation and business traffic is pretty significant. And it just can't handle all the stuff that's going on. If there's any sort of a constraint on that given day, be it weather, or if it happens to be controller staffing. I think other places where there's just been so much growth that there are issues. I look out at Las Vegas. Las Vegas is very busy and getting busier. And the, the airport there, the main airport, of course, McCarran and that has been, swamped on many days. It's got a lot of limitations. It's got crossing runway issues, close parallels. So, I think those, issues. Those are what I think of as the main choke points. You also have the kind of the more traditional long range choke points, which would be some of the oceanic stuff, particularly in the North Atlantic, but that's, I think, maybe operating better than it used to. And then you have the old traditional places like Chicago, which just has volume of airplanes and, and has issues with different airports there. I mean, Midway in the and the big airport at O'Hare operate close to each other. There's a lot of other airports. Atlanta kind of sits by itself, but it has a ton of airplanes. DFW, the Dallas Fort Worth area is growing dramatically. So you will see from time to time issues down there. They usually run pretty well. I would say if there's anything that happens to them, it's thunderstorms, particularly those that, evolve in the spring and early summer that come off of the planes and meet with all that nice moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. So those are the main choke point areas\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what are we doing about them? What's the technology that's being deployed and will be deployed\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, right now, I think, that the airlines have been asked to pull back their schedule a little bit in the New York area because of the demand, because of some of the issues that they have going on there, they have just recently announced that finally, after about, gosh, it's been about a three year effort, they're moving, I'll just call it the Newark sectors. Out of the New York TRACON, which is known as N90. They're moving that over to the Philadelphia Approach Control. So the Philadelphia TRACON is going to take over the airspace that controls arrivals and departures out of Newark. There's a lot of pushback on that. A lot of it was from controllers that didn't want to relocate. There were some technology issues initially, but those were solved. These are, these is new equipment and it'll play very well. I know this will shock you, but there were also some political issues there, with moving the facility but it sounds like now they're moving in that direction very quickly and they finally made a decision that the move would be completed by the end of June, but this has taken about two years, so nothing happens quickly. All of those airports in New York, as you know, Jim, I'll say surface management there. I'm going to go to that cause I know that area very well, has been a work in progress since what, 2007, 2008. And, what we saw in New York was often flights would taxi out and sit in queues. I have a picture that I still have today. It got my attention because it was at Kennedy Airport and because there had been a runway closure and they were down to a single runway operation and because the system still operated at the time, still does for the most part, on a first come first serve basis, you push back because you don't want to get left behind. You want to first come first serve. There are 63 airplanes in a single taxi queue for the departure runway and because of other issues, many of them sat out there for hours, literally. In some cases, I know of at least one flight, sat out there in the taxi queue for departure, long enough to serve the dinner meal on the aircraft. And that just seemed to be crazy. So, with that, first of all came surface surveillance to know who was out there, to really better understand what was going on. And then, I'll call it, virtual taxi queues, metering aircraft off of the gate. And Kennedy was one of the very first airports to do that. And it was in conjunction with the FAA, the airlines, and the port authority. And what that meant was you would tell the port and the FAA, what time you plan to push back. You provide a pushback time estimate, and then they would give you an actual time that you had to be not, they didn't tell you that you have to push back at this time. They would tell you what time you had to be what the FAA calls is the movement area of the airport. In other words, off of the ramp. Wanting to get onto the taxiway. And they were able to very quickly, within months, dramatically improve taxi times and delays and so forth. And, most important, improve predictability. Because in a pure first come, first served environment, not very predictable. You just go out there and get in a long queue and sit there. There was some work that was planned at LaGuardia. Back in 10 years ago, that didn't happen then. It is starting to happen now through the FAA's Terminal Flight Data Manager program, which is basically surface management, including surveillance and, times, much more accurate We\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>lorne-cass_2_03-29-2024_134854:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>timing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>TFDM is important. I was very much involved in that in my return to the FAA some years ago. Unfortunately, the program, which was, I would say envisioned in the 2005, 2006 area, and actually signed off on the concept was signed off in 2011 2012, because again of these interruptions in budget, where it was originally planned to be pretty much rolled out and ready by the early 20s. Several airports around the country, a long list of them, quite honestly, now is probably going to be 10 years delayed, and I worry about that because I worry about some of the technology in this program, it will probably be obsolete by the time the program is rolled out, but it will still make a difference compared to not having it. That's for certain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the quantifiable value of TFDM surface management is so significant. The return on investment was so high. But, Luka was asking one of our guests recently about the role of, gates and the role of surface. And so, there was some, I remember once at an investor conference and the CEO said, I don't have an air traffic problem. I have a gate problem. What did he mean by that? I As it relates to increasing the throughput of his, the number of passengers going into an airport.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, if you operate on time and at some airports, let's say you own gates, let's say and pick an airline and I own 10 gates at an airport. I'm responsible for those gates. So if I have a disruption, let's say I've got a flight that has a maintenance issue and is not going to depart the gate at two o'clock is scheduled. It's not going to be able to leave until three or later, but I have an arrival that needs a gate or that gate. I've got to figure out what I'm going to do. Am I going to move that aircraft off the gate? Am I going to try to arrange for another gate? How do I handle that? But I own it, so I can make those decisions. In some cases, I may have an airport where I'm leasing gates from the airport authority. Let's say I have those same ten gates, they're leased, and those are the gates I have to use. I may be able to use another gate that is suitable for my aircraft on another terminal or maybe down the road from where I am, down the terminal from where I am, and maybe I won't be able to do that. So gates are huge and understanding for the airline using some of the data that we have started to collect, for example, through TFDM with this, I'll call it the virtual taxi queuing, estimated off blocks times, for example, maybe have a better idea how my gate availability is going to occur. But I have to plan that for, and there's a whole bunch of reasons. It can't just take any gate sometime because maybe any gate doesn't work well for me in handling the aircraft when it's on the ground. Maybe it doesn't work well for my customers that have close connections. I don't want to be over in Terminal D when my customers have close connections in Terminal A. So I've got to be able to manage that. So gates are critical. Some of the newer technologies that are out there, including a couple that have been developed in house, take the gate availability into the mix of the overall schedule and overall irregular ops recoveries and so forth. And that's a huge deal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's so important for people to understand this level of complexity in the air, on the surface, and at the gate, and the number of different technologies that are used. The information sharing that takes place, and actually, frankly, the role of some really small companies that are making great innovations in this area. So for those that are listening, you're hearing an industry expert talk about great opportunities for optimization and improvement, and some are doing a good job today, but there's a lot of opportunity for technology deployment here, isn't there, Lorne?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, there is. and there is a lot of it being deployed. And I would say those that have the expertise, there's a lot of opportunity out there. And I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in the new world of AAMs. If you think about, what they're going to need to do. And if you think about a VertiPort operation, that's going to have to be another one of those things, because I know it's hard to believe, but, your operation is not going to be operating exactly as you planned every day. Some days it'll work really well and other days it won't. And you may end up showing up at the VertiPort when there's no, no place for you to park. So all those things have to be factored in.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, you were known in the industry as somebody who, if you want to bring new technology to an airline, see Lorne first. And then what advice would you give to our entrepreneurs? There's billions here to be saved and to be optimized with more efficient operations. And then you can imagine the opportunities with Advanced Air Mobility coming online. What advice would you give to, to an organization that they think they have a pretty good technology and they've been told to go see Lorne Cass to see, how should I really bring this to market? What advice would you give them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, call me and I'll tell them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:28\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, right, right,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Okay. Okay. Fair enough. again, going back to, they've got to develop a relationship with the operator of this particular vehicle and learn from what they're doing. And when you're talking about to the new entrant operators, you need to use some of the things that have been learned in the airline world and the airline world is still learning and has a lot to learn yet, like many other businesses, but it is done much better at using available capacity that it has control of. And I put that's important, but it needs to have a better understanding of the stuff I can control as the operator and things I can't control, like I said, as soon as my vehicle moves, everything is, think of it this way, the airline industry is deregulated. I put that in, in, in quotes. And the AAM operator, for example, eVTOL operator is also going to be quote unquote deregulated. But the fact is as soon as you put that vehicle into the airspace, you are in a highly regulated environment and anything that you can help the operator learn about different constraints that are going to impact the operation that will allow him to operate more efficiently in that highly regulated environment from takeoff to touchdown is going to be very important. In addition to that, you need to pull in all the things around that airport operation or vertiport operation, whatever it is, but go to them. And first of all, as I said, listen, ask them what they think they need. Ask them how they use tools today that they might be able to use in this new AAM world. I'm talking about if you go talk to the airlines, but I think it's going to be an important place to go and understand how they manage this and you're going to have to help them because, there's going to be a need for clear rules of responsibility and lines of authority and accountability. You have to help them with those things and I can't repeat that enough. Remember, responsibility, authority and accountability is going to be required by not only the FAA, but by your customers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:15:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the common frustrations that we hear from people who are trying to push new technology into the airline industry even for things that are relatively easy to fix, the lower hanging fruit around air traffic management, everybody broadly recognizes that there is, maybe an opportunity to improve the efficiency of the overall system by 10, 15 percent perhaps. But the common frustration is that you're dealing with so many different stakeholders, different nations, integration with IT systems that are very fragmented, that are very old, very fragile, and hence you're talking to an audience that doesn't really have the appetite to, change things. In fear of risking potentially even a worse outcome. What strategies, what kind of advice would you have for those people to circumvent some of those issues?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:16:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, those are big issues and I do think that, the new operator, the AAM, if you will. I think that they're going to start off, in my opinion, the starting role for them is going to be in serving, I think, high value customers of a given airline or airlines. And I think that's going to mean more of the stuff that's going to be fairly close in, pretty well defined, in the longer term, when you get to the vehicles with a higher capacity and range, then I think, some of that regional operation makes sense as well. So, I think the, and I heard Mr. Rinaldi say the same thing and I agree with him. I think now some of the operators those that are getting closer to operating, recognize that you're going to have to go in and use the ATC system as it exists today to start. That means you're going to be flying things like helicopter routes and so forth. As you prove your operation on those routes to yourself to your, local airport, vertiport, whatever it is, to the FAA and to your customer and show that you can operate those reliably, then I think there'll be an opportunity to expand. There's airspace today that, that could be utilized. The other thing I think that I do believe has to be looked at is at the airport itself, if you're operating to or from an airport or a vertiport, you have to fully understand what it's going to take to turn the vehicle. You also have to understand irregular operations. And so, for example, if your vehicle carries four people and has a payload of, a thousand pounds, you're going to be right at max, pretty much and then most of these vehicles are electric. so range is important, and I see some that advertise a range of X number of miles. But I look at them and think, gee, what kind of reserves do I have? Because the operation is not running the way I thought it was going to run and I'm delayed, I'm behind, or I have to divert because of some issue. what can I recover this vehicle if I divert to some other place? How does that work? So I think there are a lot of things, the operators themselves, the OEMs and the operators, in many cases, it'd be one and the same initially from what I can see. I think they have to take all that into account. And maybe they are and maybe they're not. But I, there's things I worry for example, about icing. I hear many operators say, we won't fly into icing. My response is, yes, you will. And you have to be prepared for that and understand how your vehicle's gonna deal with it. And there's just other things for customers and so forth. I thought, Jim, that the gent you had on that was talking about the G Force as an elevator design, how that might impact the eVTOL world. And I thought that those are the types of things that have to be thought of.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:19:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's terrific.

So, I think it's important to these new operators to get involved as they can in the world of CDM, in the world of standards, be in the room and many of them are, but get in the room and work on things like standards are going to be very important. And standards are not good standards unless they're built by consensus and collaboration. And I think that there are several different standards organizations that you should go out and get involved with. because I think that will help you. And when you go into those meetings, by the way, whether you're in a standards organization or you're at a CDM meeting or something similar, or even going and sitting in on one of the Advanced Aviation Advisory Committee meetings in the audience, you're going to learn, you're going to learn from other people in the room, and realize that you don't know everything and go listen to some others that have some experience in the arena or have been there before\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And you're going to be seen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And you're going to be seen.

Overall, Andrew's insights reflect a well-informed and balanced perspective on the evolving landscape of UAS and UTM.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>06:24 The End Goal for UTM\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>08:46 Difference Between U-Space and UTM\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>12:14 The Controversy of Integrating ATC with UTM\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>18:17 The Roadmap to UTM Success: Milestones and Challenges\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>21:27 The Impact of Automation on Air Traffic Management\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>27:39 Moving Away From VHF Communications in Air Traffic Management\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>30:36 Air Risk Mitigation\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>38:28 Implementing U-Space\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>43:37 Detect-And-Avoid in U-Space\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>51:47 Adapting Strategic Deconfliction to Real-World Uncertainties\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>58:02 Why Is There Not Greater Focus On Tactical Deconfliction?\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>01:01:38 Innovations in Drone Detection Technologies\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>01:06:52 The Business of U-Space Service Provisioning\u003C/span>\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv>\u003Cspan>01:13:35 Comparing U-Space and FAA Approaches to Drone Traffic Management\u003C/span>\u003C/div>","itunesImage":"https://storage.buzzsprout.com/variants/b6szepdko8fjjn0mfhwef0zhw20l/60854458c4d1acdf4e1c2f79c4137142d85d78e379bdafbd69bd34c85f5819ad.jpg","episodeNumber":"62","seasonNumber":"","duration":"5161","weight":"61986152","soundLink":"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1875560/14670835-62-andrew-hately-eurocontrol-u-space-utm-and-the-integrated-airspace.mp3","podcast":"6316261939dfae00184ce4f2","autoSync":false,"categories":["commercial aviation","autonomy","physical and digital infrastructure","policy and regulations"],"tags":[],"videoUrl":"","audioEmbed":"\u003Ciframe data-src=\"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1875560/14670835-62-andrew-hately-eurocontrol-u-space-utm-and-the-integrated-airspace?iframe=true\" height=\"200\" class=\"episode-iframe lazyload\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"true\" style=\"height:200px;\">\u003C/iframe>","guests":[],"transcript":"\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>0:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We wanted to see from the beginning where we wanted to get to at the end.

And we wanted to see clearly what's the goal, and then work back how do we get there. And if the goal as I see it, is that we end up more or less integrating UTM and current air traffic control then we need to accomplish a number of steps, which are going to be quite difficult. And so I have the tendency to draw attention to these difficult steps right now, when people say we might do these later, or hopefully maybe do these never because they're difficult. And I, I feel if we take that approach we will have never reached the goal and the benefit that we really would like. So I tend to argue against the expedient and the convenient, and I'm pushing towards difficult steps and so for some of my colleagues, these steps really are tough.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to\"The Vertical Space\" and a conversation with Andrew Hately, a senior researcher in the Drone unit at the EUROCONTROL Innovation Hub in France. Andrew talks about what major steps must be taken with UAS traffic management and U-Space, and that radical steps have to be taken to integrate the airspace. And if we're going to get the high density operations we need an airspace where all aircraft are going to fly together. And if we don't do it, UAS is unlikely to be economically viable. He extensively discusses U-Space. How it started. Where it stands today, the requirements for setting up U-Space, why it's taken so long to implement and how it'll evolve in the future. Something really revealing about Andrew, in my opinion, is his comment early in our discussion, as he says, we wanted to see from the beginning where we wanted to get to in the end. Where in other parts of the world, UTM is being deployed in a slow iterative process, perhaps the most convenient steps, but not the best steps. Andrew wants to design the system from the beginning and the way he envisions it, looking in the end. And that the expedient and the convenient, we'll never get to where we want to eventually be. That was a really good discussion. Another good section is on drone detection. He refers to the categories of the careless, the clueless and the criminal, and how detection has to account for each. He discusses radar acoustic optical radio-based systems and others, and the challenges of detecting noncooperative aircraft. He mentioned that detect and avoid is not a focus of U-Space today. And how U-Space plans do safely separate vehicles. And to that end, we have a great discussion around tactical and strategic deconfliction. He explains that so much as strategic today because he believes they currently don't have any confidence in this surveillance. And then in order to do tactical maneuvers, you need to know where the aircraft are. Listen how Andrew believes manned and unmanned aircraft will be managed in the same traffic management system. And what will become an automatic traffic management system. Yes I agree with Andrew this is certainly where people tend to get a bit anxious, including some who've been on our podcast. We admire his bold albeit controversial approach to the future of traffic management. He talks a lot about commercial organizations or service providers who are providing or plan to provide traffic management functions. Who they are and where they're based and their commercial and business opportunities. He discusses that these are very tough times to be in the service provider business. Because there's not enough flying yet. He says we suffered from a bootstrap problem in this domain that until there's traffic management there won't be flying and until there's flying, there won't be traffic management. So somebody has to get it started and these companies are all hoping it starts soon. It was an absolute delight to speak with Andrew. He's so informed, he's been doing this for a long time, he's extraordinarily articulate and he has a realistic, balanced, yet optimistic view of how UAS and UTM operations will come together and has some clear areas where UAS operations have real and unique value today. Andrew, thanks for joining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our conversation with Andrew Hatley as you innovate and The Vertical Space.

I am from a research background, and I have been looking at this, UTM, U-Space stuff, and I've been thinking from the beginning, where do we want to go eventually? And I see that there are some radical steps that we need to take. And I have had some disagreements with some people, even some quite notable people on Is it worth taking these steps? Are these steps going to be too costly or too difficult? But I would say that if we are going to get to high density of operations, we're going to get to, electric vehicles carrying passengers, then we need to have, an airspace where all of the aircraft can fly together. And that's going to take a revision of flight rules, which might influence the airspace categorization classes, and I think these steps are a bit scary for some people. Some people look at the current situation and say, how do we get there? So, there are a few people in the industry who disagree with me on taking radical steps, and are these steps justified? But I would say if you look at the alternative, we will just never get to the situation where UAS are economically viable if we don't take these steps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is the disagreement due to the fact that people don't necessarily see the additional value prop or is the disagreement in terms of the complexity, both technical and organizational, to pull something like that off?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the disagreement is mostly about how do we make the step. For example, would it involve retraining people or would it involve modifying aircraft and things like that? And there's always this resistance because the initial impact will be so large. And so that, that's why people tend to disagree with me, but I would always argue that not doing this, the impact will be even larger. So at a certain point we have to grasp the nettle and take a difficult decision. So. I know I recently had a disagreement with Maria from EASA about whether or not we could have a UTM system, a U space system, ultimately controlling manned aircraft. And she felt that was perhaps going to be such a difficult step that there wouldn't be support for it in the industry and so on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Maybe it's important to highlight the difference in the definitions between the U. S. and, Europe. Because I'm guessing in the context that you're referring to, UTM is, increasing automation in managing air traffic, as opposed to traffic management of unmanned aerial systems. Is that correct?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So when we started, the term UTM was being used as a general term. Now, the specific implementation in America has quite a defined scope and is a lot less general than the way that we were using the term in the research community. The European version, USPACE, we started to look at that from a research point of view as being ultimately something that would go on to control these eVTOLs and similar things like that. UTM as it has been implemented in the USA is very much about supporting current operations, supporting VLOS flights, and allowing VLOS flights to occur in an airspace where there are possibly VFR flights going on and things like that. I will tend to use the term UTM more in the general sense, meaning any traffic management of unmanned aerial systems. And typically we are looking at this being completely unmanned traffic management or, as unmanned as we can make it, there will always be a need for escalation to a human for obscure corner cases. We've seen this in many forms of automation, but the general operation we expect will be automatic and it will be providing a service. Because it's automatic, it'll be providing a service which is scalable to a very large amount of traffic, and it'll be providing that service very cheaply. So the scope of USPACE is much broader than the current term UTM is used in the U. S., which is really focusing on the current operations of VLOS flights in the most part. I would imagine as, this part 108, is published for consultation in the summer. it may be that the term UTM begins to take on a broader meaning in the USA. Because I think part 108 will push the envelope a bit and push it towards some of the decisions which have already been made in Europe. do you want me to contrast the USPACE and UTM? Would that be helpful?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Great.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So in, in Europe, USPACE is something which is proposed by the regulator and the USPACE service provider has certain obligations towards the regulator. In the USA, the UTM system, all of the responsibility rests with the aircraft operator and the UTM service provider is a subcontractor of the aircraft operator, but all of the liability still rests with the aircraft operator at all times. So the aircraft operator is seeking support, but that's all he gets from the UTM service provider. Whereas in USPACE, the USPACE service provider is something a little bit like an air navigation service provider in that they have their own responsibilities and they are meeting these towards the regulator rather than only towards the aircraft operator.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, if you could, I think there's subtleties to how people disagree with you. Explain a little bit more about, why you are not at the same sheet. So for example, so many people may say there's going to be an iterative approach to UTM or to U space where you may be feeling, I want to go further faster. Others may be also saying, and I'm now I'm cheating a little bit because we talked a little bit about this in advance, you see the ATC piece being integrated much faster into UTM than others would say, and that's clearly getting into a controversial area. So could you dispel it a little bit more?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it comes from, how we started. the group I was working in started looking at, UTM and USPACE. We wanted to see from the beginning where we wanted to get to at the end. Although it will be an iterative process, we didn't want it to be a process in which each step was going to be the most convenient step to take right now, without a view of where the path would lead. And we wanted to see clearly what's the goal, and then work back how do we get there. And if the goal as I see it, is that we end up more or less integrating UTM and current air traffic control then we need to accomplish a number of steps, which are going to be quite difficult. And so I have the tendency to draw attention to these difficult steps right now, when people say we might do these later, or hopefully maybe do these never because they're difficult. And I, I feel if we take that approach. We will have never reached the goal and the benefit that we really would like. So I tend to argue against the expedient and the convenient. And I'm pushing towards difficult steps and for some of these, so for some of my colleagues, these steps really are tough. If we want to qualify, an automatic system as being an ANSP, then we need to learn a lot about how we qualify these systems, what the expectations are. Today, if you look at, an Air Navigation Service Provider, we certify these with reference to the responsibilities of people, with reference to the responsibilities of management, and it's much harder to take that and say, well, how could we implement all of this stuff as software? What's the algorithmic basis on which you could provide these services without a human there? And it, I think there's a lot of worries in the minds of people who have to actually practically do this, which Perhaps they're not pressing on me so hard as I'm in the research domain. it's much easier for me to be a visionary because, well, I won't be alone in trying to implement this for one thing,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you're also advocating, listening carefully. There are people who are beating up their phones right now, I think, listening to what you just said. So you're also advocating some form of automated air traffic control here, which would have less human involvement. So I would assume this is another controversial part of what you're saying, but you may not be saying that, so please explain in more detail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that's where we get to, but it doesn't start like that. So it starts with, we want to fly UAS in the lower airspace. And we would like to do this as cheaply as possible. So we would like to provide, traffic management services mostly on the basis of software. Probably with a human supervisor for these unusual corner cases for escalation in case of an emergency. But for the general running, Software based. Once we have a software based traffic management system, we have the question about what do we do when a manned aircraft wanders in there for whatever reason. If it's a manned aircraft which is expected, for example some helicopter emergency medical service flight, or a manned aircraft which is unexpected, some light aircraft which has had an engine failure, how do we deal with that? And the current approach which What is proposed is to deal with this as an exception, and we will have the UAS move out of the way and the manned aircraft will be treated as an emergency case. But in the longer term, if we're going to do this in a scalable manner, that manned aircraft has to be treated as a routine process. So eventually, we would like the manned aircraft to participate in the traffic management system, which is providing a service for the UAS. So the, I would like that the manned aircraft is filing a plan, and then is being given an authorization, and then is being monitored that it's following its plan. And once we start to do that, we see that we have a system which can be scaled upwards. These, electrically powered, taxi flights, these eVTOLs, passenger carrying operations, which many operators would like to do without a pilot on board, will probably be managed by a similar, UAS traffic management system. In Europe, we expect USPACE to manage these, but they'll be flying a bit higher than the bottom level, 500 feet. They'll be flying up to a few thousand feet. So now we have a situation where this is an airspace where manned aircraft might fly more than just in case of emergency. And again, I would propose that the logical way to do this in a scalable manner would be to integrate the manned and the unmanned aircraft so that they're controlled by the same system, and so that they are able to interact in a safe but integrated way, and that requires that we have an automatic system which is now giving instructions to manned aircraft, not as an exception, and then we need a qualified automatic system, which is capable of safety of life operations and is good enough to do this. I think that's where people begin to get a bit anxious and begin to disagree with me. I want to go too fast. I'm not sure if I do want to go too fast, but I have a clear view of where I want to get to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Andrew, if this is what success looks like ultimately with UTM, can you go in a bit more detail to describe the milestones that will lead to this success? Both on the, technical side, implementation, cultural, organizational. what are all the stakeholders who have a say in this progression?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, so there's quite a few people involved there. So, The first is that we need to be confident that we can do it. So we need the industry, which is producing the systems, to be able to demonstrate that these systems are good enough and have a high enough quality and a high enough, availability and resilience that they are capable of being trusted to do this. The second step is we need to understand how it will be done. And one of the key problems here, which I would like to spend more time working on, is the flight rule. We do not today fly small UAS following either visual flight rules or instrument flight rules. And if you look at the way that ICAO describes airspace classes, they're all described in terms of these two flight rules. So what we need to do is identify a flight rule for the small UAS, and then understand how it can safely interoperate with the existing ones or the existing manned traffic. One option would be that there's a new flight rule that all of the traffic follows, both manned and unmanned. Another option is that we would find a third flight rule which is compatible with the other two in some way. If you look at the descriptions of how, flights are supposed to occur, it is possible to mix visual flight rules and instrument flight rules today. If we had a third flight rule, perhaps we could find a way to mix that. So, we need to understand the operational basis on which the traffic is mixed together. We need to understand the technical basis on which it's done. What are the procedures? Are the systems capable of providing them? We need to convince the regulator that this is going to be safe enough. It should meet the target level of safety. and we need to convince the existing aviation community this approach is going to be acceptable to them. That they are going to certainly not be inconvenienced and hopefully will benefit from this approach. And we're a little bit optimistic on this basis because, studies have shown that current visual flight rules are not really as safe as people believe they might be, and particularly, tests about visual acquisition of the target show that it's quite common that a pilot of a VFR flight doesn't see everything that they, should. So we are hoping that by providing some support, which is being originated to allow, remotely operated aircraft to fly, that we can enhance the experience of pilot onboard aircraft and that way we can get acceptance for these kinds of what would otherwise be really fairly radical changes to the way that the airspace is structured.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the primary benefit of increasing automation in the air traffic management function? Is there mostly a safety argument? Would you say that this is the primary problem that the industry is facing, or is it more about productivity, being able to accommodate greater traffic density, because part of it, and I'd love your thoughts on it as well, the way traffic management is done in Europe is not the same, obviously, as it's done in the U S organizationally, but at the same time, it feels like there is more inefficiencies and please correct me if I'm wrong in Europe because of the fragmented market, and every nation wanting to have that function internally, as opposed to perhaps sharing it among multiple countries. A couple of questions in there, and I know there's a lot to unpack there, but, what comes to mind?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So there, there are several points there, which I'll need to unpack. Yes. The European air traffic management system is quite fragmented and complicated because air traffic management is the, responsibility of sovereign nations. And in the European Union, we have 27. In, in Eurocontrol, we have 41 member states. So each of these is able to operate its airspace as it wishes, but we work together, and you probably know that Europe has a single integrated traffic management system operated by Eurocontrol, the network manager, and we in the network manager, we ensure that each air traffic control center, well, ensure, we aim that each air traffic control center does not suffer from more traffic than it's able to manage. So there is a process, a rolling process every day where the air traffic control centers look at what kinds of effects might influence their ability to manage traffic, weather effects. I mean, weather is a dominant phenomenon in American air traffic management. it's more prevalent here only in the height of summer and winter. But still weather takes a role. You also have, more subtle effects like important football matches or other things like that which cause, increases in the flow of traffic. All of this is discussed every day in a rolling program and then in the network management system we implement delayed takeoff to avoid that there is, too much traffic in the air, more traffic than can be safely managed. So this goes back to the start of the question where you said, is this a, an issue of safety or is it an issue of capacity? Safety is never compromised, but the result is that when we hit a hard capacity limit, the demand cannot be accommodated at the time it would like to be. So, in Europe, we have these take off slots, which are issued for traffic management reasons, and that is quite evident. In the summer months in Europe, quite a number of sectors of the European sky are at the limit. The traffic cannot be increased without quite some evolution in how we manage the traffic. Certainly among the most busy airspaces in Europe is the region above Belgium, which is a crossing point for traffic coming off the Atlantic Ocean, heading to various European airports, and also traffic flying from Scandinavia towards Spain, and so it's a bit of a crossroads there. And in, in the Belgian sectors, the, Maastricht Air, Upper Air Traffic Control Center really is often pushing towards what it can deal with. And the result, unfortunately, is that the aircraft takeoffs have to be delayed. So, continuously in, in European ATM research, we're looking at how can we improve the capacity without compromising the safety. Many of these kinds of questions can be addressed by some of the techniques that we're looking at to use for UAS traffic management. One of the kind of the most basic principles is we've divided the air traffic management world into sectors. Each sector has normally a pair of air traffic controllers, one of them is talking on the radio to the aircraft, he's the executive, the other air traffic controller is coordinating with other sectors, and the limit to how much work they can do is the mental capacity of these two Air Traffic Controllers to think about the number of aircraft in their sector. For a sector where the traffic mostly fly in straight lines, that capacity can be very high. For a sector where the traffic have to be steered towards an airport or something like that, the capacity is much lower. But it's a mental limit. If the system is completely automated, a computer has no mental limit. We can just buy a faster and faster processor or scale it among multiple computers. So the limits become other than mental capacity. And that way we can, develop techniques in UAS traffic management, which will be re applicable in manned traffic management and promise to increase capacity and possibly reduce costs also. And those aims I think will be in the interest of all airspace users, all air traffic is looking for these kinds of benefits. So there's a great deal of interest from the air traffic management world in what we're doing in the UAS traffic management. But also, as a primary job, we would like to enable UAS traffic. The European Commission and the European, Parliament have identified that operation of small UAS will provide economic stimulus. There will be jobs resulting from these kinds of activities. So they're keen for this to happen as an end in itself. But the benefit that we can accrue from that, we can also apply to air traffic in general.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>27:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Andrew, in that vision that you lay out for the transition to automated handling of, that air traffic, is there agreement on the roadmap for how that information would be communicated to the aircraft themselves and how we move from where we are today to have a different way of communicating that information that its own pipeline is much, much higher capacity than voice over VHF that we have today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, we're at the beginning of this. So, we have a vision of this today. We are not even close to implementation. So the roadmap to get there will start by, let's understand the problem and solve it for the small UAS. And that's going to take us several years. it'll be 2050 or later, before we're beginning to apply this stuff to all upper air traffic. So in, In beginning to attempt to answer these questions, yes, we are looking at what's called, Controller Pilot Data Link, CPDLC, which is being used today in Europe for what you might call low priority communication between the air traffic controller and the pilot. So effectively, they're sending text messages to each other. The use of this I anticipate will increase, and in order to increase, it will require that we have low latency communications. When CPDLC started, there was a lot of worry about the latency, the messages might take a long time. But as we get used to using them, then yes, this could be a way forward. This could be a way to allow further automation of the air traffic control system and then conveying the, information to the aircraft in a more speedy and timely manner.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are people also looking at what that workflow looks like for pilots and controllers where you might have mixed usage of voice over VHF and then the rollout of a data based link and how do people who are in flow, who are, working the traffic, how do they bridge across both of those modalities?

I've been involved in, simulation to do with researching this at least nearly 20 years ago, and the early use of CPDLC has been, well over 15 years. It is an ongoing activity and it's also used in the US and elsewhere. The crucial step is to trust it to be speedy enough to use for the kind of separation clearances. Today we're using it for the, lower speed stuff, the, uh, change the radio frequency and contact the other sector type instructions. But, for data link to be, the only means of communication, we need to get a bit more confidence about how well it works and how speedily it works.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, let's talk a little bit about Air Risk Mitigation. Let's bring it back to drone air traffic management. How is EASA approaching Air Risk Mitigation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, today the U space regulations describe a thing called a U space airspace. So the state will declare a U-Space airspace, and that's where these services will be provided and where there will be used. So this process of declaring a U-Space airspace, it's a kind of little reserved area which is dedicated towards flying, UAS BVLOS flights, and so the state has to, or the competent authority as it's called, it's often the Civil Aviation Authority or the National Safety Agency, but it's an agency which is interested in air traffic, will have to look at the region where they want to create this thing, and they will have to create what they call a concept of operation, what they expect the UAS to do, how they expect them to fly, the processes they want to follow, the expected performance, what is the, navigation performance they expect from the aircraft, what speeds are expected, what's the latency that they expect. So once they have this concept of operations and they have to make a kind of estimate of the traffic, they will then do this airspace, risk assessment in which they will balance all of these factors and they will come up with a, A description of how this USPACE airspace can be operated safely or meeting the target level of safety which has been put forward for the area. So that is in the bubble of the USPACE airspace. So EASA today is segregating the UAS into these little regions. For a flight outside these regions, EASA has described an open category of flight, which is visual line of sight, which is done, in a manner where basically the UAS has to get out of the way when something is coming. And the other option is certified operations, which at the moment, there's not really much said by EASA. That would be something that would need to be worked out between the aircraft operator and the Civil Aviation Authority, probably with some kind of specific agreement about how it would be done. Maybe with a danger area created or, temporarily segregated area created for the flight to occur. So these are the, three means of operating today. And this is how, air risk is being handled. In the U-Space regulation, you find two other aspects which relate to air risk. There's this idea of dynamic airspace reconfiguration, and in this process, if necessary, U Space airspace will be temporarily closed to allow a manned aircraft to pass. And this is considered to be done when the airspace was previously controlled airspace, and this process would allow it to revert to being controlled airspace. So, air traffic control could decide to close the used space to allow an aircraft to fly through safely. The third method, is this electronic conspicuity where a manned aircraft could enter the U space airspace so long as it was visible to U space. And this is, in my personal opinion, the least well described. I could imagine this working as an exceptional process, but I'm not so happy with it being a regular thing, because effectively the manned aircraft comes along and all of the U-Space traffic has to get out of the way, and in doing so may encounter their own problems. So, this is the current approach to air risk. It has to be said that the current European, regulations anticipate quite low density of traffic, and we would be looking forward to a revision of the regulations, as the density of traffic is rising, and we start to see a need for more subtle, air traffic management for the UAS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can we be a bit more specific and maybe run through a scenario of a drone operator who wants to fly a commercial drone delivery service or any commercial drone beyond visual line of sight in a, suburban slash rural area. And let's put the ground risk aside and just focus on the air risk. The challenge that exists today, and again, correct me if I'm wrong, but if one looks at the SORA air risk matrix, essentially any time that you're flying below 500 feet above ground, unless you are flying in uncontrolled airspace over rural areas, you pretty much immediately fall in, in the Air Risk Charlie class, which automatically classifies the operation as SAIL 4. The problem, though, is there's no tactical, TMPRs the tactical mitigations for the residual air risk that are approved for, medium and high integrity levels. So the challenge for these drone operators becomes; how can we somehow reduce the air risk class by either flying in U space, which is automatically class Bravo, or I shouldn't be using class Bravo because that confuses with traditional airspace, but ARC B, or they go and run an analysis of the actual air traffic, and show that the risk of encountering, manned traffic is actually lower than what the original SORA matrix would suggest, and therefore they get that class reduction. So talk about this challenge that operators today face. What are the levers that they usually pull on? Is this description correct?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Your description is perfect, and I'm very impressed with your knowledge of the domain. Yes, this is exactly what's going on. And if you look at, and I must say it's not something I'm particularly expert on, but if you look at the operations today, which are occurring, you have Manna operating in Ireland. You have Wing operating in Finland, you have soon Amazon operating Italy. They are typically having to deal with the fact that there's not yet uSpace available, but uSpace is coming soon. And as you correctly described, one of the things that they have to do is they have to make an argument about is the air risk acceptable? Is the risk of manned traffic coming by low enough? And typically that can be mitigated by asking for a restriction. and in Finland, you find, occasional restrictions are placed with the word Wing in the title, so you know who's operating there, but, either a restriction or, as you say, an analysis of the traffic, but that analysis, which you're talking about is the first small iteration towards this air risk assessment. Air risk assessment is a more thorough and long term version of this analysis. And so setting up a U-Space airspace is a logical extension of the process that, an exceptional operation would need to go through. So today, these operations are not in U-Space airspace, but the hope is that very soon they will be, we're expecting 2024 to see the first U-Space airspace is declared and it clearly makes sense to put them where people are currently wanting to fly. So, I would hope to see their emergence, in and around some of these areas where these operations are occurring.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:28\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the requirements for setting up U-Space? Is there a threshold in terms of the traffic density that an area needs to have in order to warrant U-Space implementation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, there's nothing like that. It's a a choice to be made by the competent authority in each state. So we may see, U-Space airspaces which are set up in result of a demand from an Aircraft operator. We may see them being set up as a result of a demand from a service provider. We have seen a lot of interest in flying in harbors, for example, and there the harbor operator might be the one who would be, pushing for, a U-Space airspace to, to be declared. Or we might see states who want to set up U-Space airspaces because they have an expectation that once one exists that flying will begin. It's hard to predict at the moment because we're in a special period at the moment. Everybody is feeling their way and learning how to do this. I think once we have one or two U-Space airspaces declared, I think we will, then gain more experience about how to create them, more experience about how they can be used, and we'll see a period of fine tuning, but also a period when more and more are created as the states master the process and are more confident about declaring these things. And it must be said that there is quite a lot of work to do in the airspace risk assessment, because at a certain point there needs to be a link made between, for example, separation and the performance of the various systems, the performance of the aircraft, the performance of the traffic management system, the performance of the surveillance as it is. So, this is why the states are going quite slowly at the moment, but I think once it's been done a few times, I think the states will gain confidence, and it will become something which is done more readily. And then I would see in Europe that it would be, not unreasonable that a request from an aircraft operator, certainly if it's going to be more than just a few flights, might result in the work being done to, to set up a U-Space airspace.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Talk more, Andrew, about why it's taken so long to implement U-Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's really been a learning process. The U-Space regulation was published, in 2021, and then it took us quite a long time to develop the acceptable means of compliance. And I would say this initial acceptable means of compliance will probably be amended as we learn more. But it still has a number of gaps. There's still quite a lot to learn about, what standards to apply, how to make the implementation, how to certify the service providers. What the, Airspace Risk Assessment comes out at. What is the minimum required performance for the aircraft in order to achieve a separation which is fine enough to make the U-Space airspace have a capacity that makes it worth operating? We can achieve safety by restricting the flights a great deal, but that's not the aim of U-Space U-Space should allow BVLOS flight to be approved relatively quickly and often that the expectation is that the aircraft operator will put in a plan and generally that plan will be approved. We are hoping to avoid that, that planning results in rejection and conflict detection as a, a frequent occurrence. It should be a rare occurrence. We're hoping to promote the use of the UAS by, creating these U-Space airspaces. So the, airspace risk assessment should hopefully, produce a separation requirement which allows a reasonable capacity. And the state, or the competent authority which is making the airspace risk assessment needs to be convinced that the performance of the aircraft, the navigation performance, its ability to fly, the surveillance system, the satellite navigation and so on. All produce a situation where this separation can be achieved and produce a convincing story that it can be achieved repeatedly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, where and when do you see U-Space being deployed in Europe in what countries and why?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have a reasonable expectation that we'll see something in 2024, probably Spain, Switzerland, and I'm hoping in Antwerp, there's a project called BIRDI, a European funded research project, which is trying to create, U-Space airspace over Antwerp harbour and I think they have a good chance. They, have a lot of resources and they're working hard towards this. But at the same time, there's a kind of unofficial race going on. I think Zurich are doing well and, I think we'll see one in Spain certainly in 2024, if at all possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Drone Detection, how are they handling it in the U-Space? What are the different ways they're addressing it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So drone detection has not been considered part of U-Space so far. And this is perhaps, it's worth noting that, security matters are the domain of the state. And, EASA, European Aviation Safety Authority, tends not to, get too much involved in saying things about what states should do. So, the U-Space regulation doesn't talk about drone detection, but we have a lot of interest in drone detection in Europe, and we're seeing quite a lot of activity, often driven by, state security organizations, often relating to airports, but other areas as well. And, the drone detection really is aiming at three different groups, referred to as the careless, the clueless and the criminal. And for the careless and the clueless, we can do quite a lot because we may require fit of equipment to the aircraft, which makes them detectable. The criminal are the third group and we're in an arms race with them. It's always going to be, what can we do and what can they avoid us doing? So, I think progress is being made in this field. Initially there was a lot of interest in primary radar, but that's very difficult. The aircraft presents a very small target for radar. The reflection is quite weak. The, small UAS move around at similar speeds to cars in some cases, or to birds. So it's easy to get, false positives from other things. So it's a difficult radar target, but there are methods that can be used. Other techniques which can be used include listening out for the command and control link radio signals. But again, in the case that somebody really doesn't want their drone to be observed, they can find ways around this. There has been some interesting work about drone detection in terms of one aircraft detecting another based on listening. There was a project called PercEvite, which was working on a hear and avoid, mechanism. And, that looked quite promising. And there's been a number of projects have been looking at see and avoid based on cameras and image recognition, sometimes stereoscopic, sometimes, with a single camera, these have in the kind of prototypes required quite a lot of electricity to be put into the, computing process to do the image recognition. But perhaps with a bit of refinement, these could become practical. It's not something that we're particularly concerned about in U-Space yet, because in U-Space we consider detect and avoid to be a safety net rather than the primary means of separation. So we are not at the moment requiring detect and avoid to be something fitted to aircraft in U-Space. Instead, we will separate the aircraft very widely so we feel that the residual risk is low enough that the detect and avoid is not necessitated. It will probably become something more significant when we go to higher risk operations, either because the density increases or because we start to have passenger carrying or things like that. So, there the risk might push us towards requiring, a safety net in terms of a collision avoidance system on the aircraft. And there, there is a lot of work being done. But at the moment, U-Space is not mandating any particular implementation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the U-Spaces that you expect to come online this year, the DAA function, as you say, will just be, assured in terms of making sure that the airplanes and drones never come close to each other or the drones themselves right. Is there a difference in how you are thinking about separating drones from manned aviation as opposed to drones versus drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the current functioning of U-Space, the drones are separated by means of the planning. So any drone flying in U-Space must have a plan. It's called a flight authorization request. And these flight authorization requests are de conflicted. So the idea is that we de conflict the plans. If the plans are followed, then we've de conflicted the flights. We can't do this with manned aircraft that wander in. So instead we have this requirement that the manned aircraft are electronically conspicuous. The electronic conspicuity is handled by the U-Space service provider, so it becomes part of the traffic information which is shown to the pilot of the drone. Now the traffic information which is shown to the pilot of the drone differentiates between nearby aircraft which are conforming to their plan, which are, the pilot would be aware of but not concerned by. And nearby aircraft which are not conforming to their plan, which are potentially a threat. These manned aircraft, which are electronically conspicuous, will definitely be in the threat category. So, the, requirement in U-Space is that the drone takes appropriate action, which will be to get out of the way. So that means that this, handling of the manned aircraft, it, it should be safe, but it is going to be an exceptional process. It is going to require that the drone deviates from its plan. I await experience to see how this works, how well we can accommodate manned aircraft, I would not be very comfortable if this was a frequent occurrence, but certainly as it's been described, it is intended to be an infrequent occurrence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in those cases where multiple drone operators are flying in the same area, how will drones be de conflicted and separated from each other?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's done by this planning. The drones will all need to plan. The plans will all be de conflicted. Even if they're using different U-Space service providers, the U-Space service providers between themselves will arrange that the plans are all de conflicted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So these service providers are commercial organizations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. So, the, approach which has been, encapsulated in the U-Space regulation is that the provision of services is a competitive commercial activity. So, we expect multiple service providers, or we hope for multiple service providers and that they will compete, they will innovate, they will offer added value to their customers. The U-Space regulation describes six services which they should provide, four of which are always required. The other two may be required depending on what the, Competent Authority says about the U-Space airspace and we expect that these commercial operators will offer their customers a service which fits the customer's need. If the aircraft operator has a need for, high precision, high efficiency, they're probably willing to pay for that, and they will be paying for tools which allow the kind of things they want to do. If the aircraft operator has lower requirements, they may be able to get by with a cheaper offering. So we expect these U-Space service providers to occupy niches, have particular specializations and to innovate in the area. So EASA, and the aim of the European Union was to create hopefully a single European market for U-Space service provision. So we would see the emergence of U-Space service providers who could operate in multiple European countries. We would get economies of scale and we would quite quickly arrive at innovation high performance and, hopefully the lowest possible price.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, this four dimensional flight path de confliction strategic planning issue, there's been some research that showed that you really can't be very confident looking more than, several minutes, into the future because things happen in real life. There's weather, there's contingencies, there's all kinds of things. How well do you think that this approach will, handle the real world?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's a continuous trade off. The, plan that the aircraft operator is asked to submit is not a line, but a series of boxes. And we asked the aircraft operator to plan these boxes, as large as they need to be that the aircraft operator has a confidence of 95 percent that they can follow this plan. So, it's not clearly spelled out, but if an aircraft operator is consistently planning too small, they will deviate very often and they will often end up in a contingency situation and they will have to invoke a contingency plan because they're unable to follow the plan that they've submitted. The other option is that the aircraft operator is very conservative and, submits enormous boxes. They say, like, all of the city for all of the afternoon, and they will simply find that they're in conflict with everybody else. So, there should be a natural pressure that the aircraft operator begins to master their uncertainties, that they begin to understand what weather will bring, and they will plan in function of their ability to fly. We, would anticipate that they would hopefully get better at this. We would hope that they could vary their speed, for example, they wouldn't always fly as fast as possible. So they have a bit of margin to deal with unexpected gusts of winds and so on. So we would hope that, in a mature U-Space, the aircraft operators are able to plan in a manner, which is sufficiently sized so that they can conform to the plan, but sufficiently small that they don't simply conflict with everybody else.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is it likely that their uncertainty will increase the more minutes into the future that they're planning? You know, they might be able to be quite precise four minutes, five minutes, seven minutes into the future in terms of where the aircraft is going to be in the plan, but if it was a very long flight, would that change towards the end of the flight or is that something that people are mitigating?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We, that, that model is generally true, but there has been work in manned aviation with what's called, trajectory based operations, where we can essentially have the idea of a kind of four dimensional contract where the aircraft will speed up and slow down in order to be within the agreed performance. The question is really a trade off. How much is the aircraft operator prepared to sacrifice in terms of flying at the most efficient speed and the straightest line compared with flying in order to be able to get their plan approved. So we would imagine there'll be a bit of give and take there, a bit of trade off, and I would imagine that once a U-Space airspace is running, the aircraft operator would be, well, complaining, would be reporting to the competent authority if the planning constraints were holding back their business. There is likely to be a requirement that the, competent authority would revisit the airspace risk assessment. And one input into that is the expected traffic. And I would expect that the aircraft operators would probably take the opportunity to express their desire for a different compromise on separation should they find it too constraining.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do people discuss things like, you know, afternoon thunderstorms that come up that might throw the entire plan out the window in this type of an architecture?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They do, but certainly, bad weather is probably less of an issue in Europe than in the US.

Yeah, absolutely. Now, the trigger, surprisingly, might not be the density, because, eventually, when we can't master the uncertainties at the strategic phase, we have to try and master the uncertainties at the tactical phase. And then we would be required to do tactical conflict resolution. Once we have tactical conflict resolution, we can allow more residual risk to remain after the strategic. But one of the big drivers of uncertainty are passengers. So I could quite imagine that the introduction of passenger operations, these eVTOLs carrying passengers around, would quite quickly push towards the need for tactical services. The passenger typically is going to have an impact on the take off time predictability. If the person has to get into the vehicle, might be their first flight, might feel a bit unsure, might feel a bit frightened or unwell. I could quite, imagine that relating to a, it takes longer than expected to close the door and then they miss the takeoff time. So I could quite imagine that we would have to go to a process where the aircraft are not de conflicted strategically, but are subject to a demand capacity balancing process and then are being de conflicted tactically. And I would say that's going to be the big push, but once we have Tactical Deconfliction, we can use it to increase the capacity of U-Space airspaces as needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I mean, this entire conversation around strategic planning, just evokes the famous Mike Tyson quote that everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. So, and, so, why especially among aviation professionals that know that things happen in the real world. It never goes according to plan. It's weather, it's, all kinds of different things, right? And so, why is there so little emphasis on tactical means is it because the technology is not there?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So why is it all strategic? Well, because we currently don't have any confidence in the surveillance. In order to do tactical maneuvers, you need to know where the aircraft are. You need to know with a known level of uncertainty where the aircraft are. And we don't today know what that level of uncertainty is. You will notice in the U-Space regulation that conformance monitoring is optional today. That's because conformance monitoring also requires that we have confidence in and have characterized the level of the surveillance that we can locate the aircraft during flight. And we don't today have that level of confidence. So the initial use of U-Space will be almost completely based on this strategic de confliction, and because of that, the margins for all of these uncertainties will have to be very large, so the aircraft will be very far apart. Once we begin to see flights, and we begin to get some experience, we can begin to characterize how well does the surveillance work. And in the U-Space regulation, there's this thing called Network Remote Identification, where the aircraft is sending to the U-Space service provider its position and the time and its identity. We will observe that for quite a while before we begin to rely on that. There may be opportunities to confirm how well that system is working. Interestingly enough, one of the users of U-Space is Israel, and in Israel, for security reasons, they have been doing a lot of monitoring the position of these aircraft by other means, and have been able to determine reasonably well how well this network remote ID is working. And certainly they have now scaled their separation minima in function of their confidence in this network remote ID. In the rest of the U-Space community, we still lack that experience, and I would expect most competent authorities would want to see traffic in their own cities, in their own U-Space airspace, and understand how well the surveillance is working before they begin to rely on it. So this is why we will have essentially have to have a time delay before we can get to any kind of tactical service. The first tactical service would be conformance monitoring. Conformance monitoring would allow, these margins for uncertainty to be reduced. They would allow the separation to be reduced a bit. And then, once we're really confident we would be able to introduce tactical services where we're giving instructions to de conflict the aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the rough timeline for this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I, optimistically, we'll see this stuff experimentally very short term but to have it rolled out generally, it could be another 10 years before everybody is really confident about this and it becomes routine, widespread.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned a little bit, different ways of, detecting. Acoustic, Optical, et cetera. Can you spend a bit more time, and perhaps broaden that list, including Radar and some of the others and comment the pros and cons, of each and what you believe is the most attractive option.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To detect a non cooperative target, the problem with radar is that you illuminate the target with your own radio. So the amount of power that needs to be pushed out in order to get an echo back is enormous. The power falls off in proportion to the fourth power of the distance. So, you can be transmitting thousands of Watts and get microWatts back. So it's a very difficult job to do. And as I said, there are similar targets which will give clutter. There are cars and birds and things like that. Typically, we're seeing radar reserved for situations where the high cost, can be justified despite the low range and the not fantastic performance of these systems, but still it's better than nothing. Much more interesting to use optical where the illumination comes from the sun and you only have to capture the reflection. There is work going on there. I haven't been so involved in using optical, processes to detect drones for example, surveillance, but in terms of, collision avoidance, there's been quite a lot of research done in universities about this. And I think we're potentially seeing, this leading to practical systems in the reasonably short term. Hear and avoid is in the very early days, but it potentially, has quite some benefit. It's very good at detecting light aircraft, for example, or helicopters, which are especially noisy. Then we get onto collaborative means. If the other aircraft would like to be detected, radio based systems are obviously one option. The problem there, though, is finding radio frequencies which are available. Proposals for the electronic conspicuity which are coming from EASA include, one of these industrial scientific and medical radio frequencies, which is all very well, but it may suffer from interference. Another option would be, acoustic or, optical broadcasting, so, some kind of flashing light or ultrasound or something like that. And I think work is going on all of these, but, Yeah, I haven't been involved particularly in any research project which is looking at that. My, my main interest so far has been traffic management rather than on vehicle systems. Our colleagues over, at, Johns Hopkins are looking at a, there is a, some work going on developing a replacement for TCAS. TCAS in the generic term is referred to in the industry as ACAS, and the project which was developing a replacement for that was ACASX. ACASX spawned some variants, one of which was ACAS XU, which was for unmanned. Quite some work has been done on that. And, Josh Silbermann at Johns Hopkins was leading a project called ACAS SXU for small unmanned. And that was pretty promising. I've not been involved in that for a year or more, but it looked like it was going to go somewhere. So that was looking at using a system which would be compatible with manned aircraft. So, I think if that comes to, fruition, it's quite likely that standard would be adopted quite widely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Has there been any research on the potential for detecting the RF energy that's being emitted by the drone's propulsion system, perhaps the speed controllers or other sources of, what most of us would refer to as EMI, but detecting that in a useful way. Is there any potential there?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is potential, but I've not been involved in any project which has looked at that. Projects which I've been aware of have more focused on the command and control link, which, is easier to detect and also easier to interrupt. There have been some, different approaches with that, because certainly, you can buy this box from DJI, this aeroscope to listen in on their communications. It makes it more obvious about what to jam if you want to jam the thing, and also you can listen on the telemetry. You can find out where the aircraft is, where the aircraft operator is, and things like that from listening into the command and control. So it's very beneficial to do that. The problem is if somebody doesn't want to be seen, they will encrypt that or they will use other methods. If they're already criminal in the way that they operate the aircraft, they can be criminal in the way they use the radio spectrum. So it is a harder task to detect and stop somebody who doesn't want to be detected and stopped.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's talk a little bit more about the service organizations you've talked about, Andrew. What's the barrier to entry for some of these organizations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The barrier to entry is probably, not enormous, but it's certainly there are fewer companies pitching into the service provision area than we saw emerge trying to build aircraft. So maybe it's not such fun. But if you look at the ones who are active today, I would single out the team at Wing as having put a lot of energy into developing standards and trying to create an environment, for U-Space for UTM. But Wing are a bit unusual in that they have no particular desire to be a service provider. They are, they see service provision as being just a necessary step so that they can become an aircraft operator. Amazon have also been active in that area. Again, Amazon, I believe, will only be their own service provider, but they've certainly contributed to the standards which are being evolved, and they've taken, quite some role in, in driving the industry. So those two are combined aircraft operator service providers. In terms of who else is in the service provision? You have a few companies who are pure service providers. I would, mention Dronic in Germany and, D Flight in Italy. and each of those kind of emerged before the U-Space regulation was published. And at that time, there was a slight expectation that they would become the kind of the appointed national service provider. But they are purely service providers. Behind them, there are companies writing software for service providers, and there are more of those, and I would mention. ANRA is one, which is operating in Europe and the USA. Unifly is based in Belgium. They've done well, supplying software to different, operating companies. OneSky, another, American company, which is seen in Europe. Drone Radar in Poland. and some of these, although they are primarily aiming at being software suppliers, some of them are in the process of becoming certified as service providers to prove themselves and also to make up for the fact that other service providers are not stepping forward. I know that ANRA are in the process of being certified at the moment, and we might see them offering services possibly in Switzerland, I don't know, but, they may see that as a necessary step. There are some of the larger ATM companies involved in the business, like Collins, Frequentis, Indra, and Thales, and all of these are looking at parts of the business, Frequentis is probably more looking at the other end. In the European model, there is the U-Space service provider, which, delivers services to the UAS operator. And then there's another body called The Common Information Service Provider. And Frequentis are looking at supplying software to those. The Common Information Service Provider is, a role which the state may appoint one or may decide not to and that role is involved in distributing information to everybody. And so Frequentis are looking at that, Indra are looking at that. So there are different larger companies looking at joining this market. I've met most of these companies through participation in European research projects. So when we've been, looking at, doing research, I've particularly been involved in research projects, looking at really fundamental questions at low maturity. I've worked with many of these companies, in these research projects, trying to answer very basic questions. How should things work? How do we solve these simple questions. What does a flight plan look like? And how do we deal with it? And so on. So, that's where I've met them. I've, I could mention even more. There's, Airbus UTM, who were previously known as Altiscope. They have a simulator. I'm working with them, they have a reference implementation of UTM in their simulator. There's a strong team there, they're very active in the development of standards, they're very active in the, work that's being done at ICAO, looking out how we can, integrate, this UAS stuff into the ICAO annexes and documents. We also have other smaller companies, the Technological Institute of Galicia has developed some UTM system, which has been adopted by Boeing. Boeing have a team in Madrid who are really expert at simulation of aerodynamics. And so Boeing have developed a simulator for, UAS which uses the ITG system to offer a complete package. There's a company called Open Skies operating. It's a very small company, but they've developed an open source, implementation of a kind of uTM system, which although it doesn't, isn't fully functional or it's partly functional, it is very compliant with the available standards. And because of the standards, compliance, their tool, Flight Blender, is widely being used for testing, often in combination with the, automatic testing mechanism of the, inter USS, which is an implementation of the, Discovery and Synchronization Service. Inter USS is also open source and it's a reference implementation of the DSS and includes within it a testing function. People are using that to test their system and they're using FlightBlender as a reference to compare their system against.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The big outstanding question is how do these companies make money, right? What's the willingness to pay?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a question I simply can't answer. These are very tough times to be in this business, because there's not enough flying yet. We suffer a bootstrap problem in this domain that until there's traffic management, there won't be flying. Until there's flying, there won't be traffic management. So somebody has to get it started, and these companies are all hoping it starts soon. Because without flying, there won't be a revenue stream for many of them. I still wonder how many, the market has room for. I have good friends in all these companies. I wish them all very well, but honestly, it's a tough business. I don't envy their position.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew talk about the origin of U-Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So U-Space, we started with, an idea that there would be traffic management and in the research domain, we looked to the end goal from the beginning. And the end goal was that we would be able to control all traffic, including passenger carrying operations. The other thing that happened quite quickly in Europe was, the European Commission identified that UAS was going to be an area of important commercial activity. So, they wanted to promote U-Space. So, top down, Europe got to work on regulations. Regulations are valuable in Europe because we are 27 European Union member states. It would be quite likely that without a top down European regulation, we would have 27 completely different implementations. So the view of the European Union was that they would like to promote a single market. They wanted a harmonized environment where an operator, an aircraft operator or a U-Space service provider operating in one European country could move to a neighboring European country without difficulty. So this is why in Europe there was a rush to produce a U-Space regulation. This U-Space regulation has described how to fly beyond visual line of sight and it's described an airspace in which this is possible called a U-Space airspace. Now in America you have a totally different set of problems and you have a totally different environment. The Federal Aviation Authority is both the regulator and the service provider. And it was quite clear that Congress wasn't excited about the FAA becoming a service provider to drones. So I would say that the momentum in the USA was held back. It wasn't being driven by the FAA. Industry was driving this, wanted to do some stuff. The FAA was following on, making it possible, but observing, and we now see the gestation of this part 108. It will hopefully be available for comment this year. I think I slightly envy the position the FAA are in, in that they will be able to write Part 108, taking into account experience and observation of flying, which is, which has taken place, without their regulation. And so I think, the rest of us will look at the American regulation. I mean, Some people might say, Oh, it's behind, but. It won't be behind. I think we're all moving at the same speed. The American regulation will benefit from having been written, having taken into account the experience that's being gained, for example, at the moment in Fort Worth, with seven different operators flying, seven different service providers supporting them. And so the learnings from that experience can be fed back into regulation. Yes, there are big differences in the current situation, but I think in general, we're pretty similar in what's driving this, that the drones are there and we need to take care of them. They may pose a risk to the other aviation. They may pose a risk to the public. In general, the Aviation Safety Authority is tasked with dealing with that. So drone regulation is a natural outcome. And the second is that in, in both the US and in Europe, there is a political imperative to enable this stuff. So the regulation is not purely restrictive. It is trying to let this stuff occur. So I, I think, we are following slightly different paths, but we're going to the same place quite quickly. And, in my domain, in the research domain, we have a healthy cooperation with both NASA and the FAA. We meet, we compare notes, we discuss. So there is not any fundamental difference in outlook or opinion. But there are some. Some differences in just, like, the way things have ended up. Our regulation came first. Our regulation particularly pushed this idea that service provision would be a competitive market. It could be, that in some states they're not bothered about that. They might want to simply appoint a single service provider, as is often done for, manned aviation. So you know, that's a choice that Europe has made so it's not necessarily the only choice, but it's the one that, in which I'm working. And, it's a similar choice that has been made in the USA. FAA doesn't want to be the service provider, so there'll be a market for service provision.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:18:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What notable differences exist in the way that the FAA and EASA think about strategic and tactical deconfliction? And especially when multiple operators are flying in the same area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:18:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the, this is most visible when you look at what's being done in the USA to support the passenger operations. So the work that's been done in the USA, on the passenger carrying operations started with this question. Is it when, well, it started with the question, what is it? And then they might discover that it was similar to, managing small UAS. In Europe, we started with the question, can we extend the system, which is designed to manage small UAS? can we extend that system to manage passenger operations? So in America, you'll hear these terms like pSU, Provider of Services to, I don't know what the U is, UAM. and we have discovered from the work done at NASA that it's very similar. One of the key differences is in the world of the passenger carrying operations, the PSU will not do strategic conflict resolution. The PSU will make, with a demand capacity balance, they will limit the number of aircraft entering the airspace to the level that the tactical processes can safely deal with, and then the separation will be tactically achieved by, well, by means which are, still under discussion, actually, because, one of the interesting things about this work on, urban air mobility in the U. S. A. is this idea that there will be these community based rules, and these community based rules are still being worked out. We in Europe are being a bit more top down, we are saying it's going to be the similar approach which was, is being used for small UAS. So we're, at the moment, we're talking about strategic followed by tactical. It may be in future that we might drop the strategic. I don't know. It depends. That's the subject at the moment for research. But, the model that we're working on today would be a strategic with a certain residual risk and then tactical to deal with that residual risk.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Andrew, paint a picture of what the next five or so years looks like in relation to U-Space drone operations in Europe and potentially beyond.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think, I would really seriously hope that within five years we see, operations of a commercial nature in Europe. I would expect to see a revision of the acceptable means of compliance of the U-Space Regulation. I would expect to see the American Part 108 has been published and is in use. I hope, but I'm not expecting a revision of the U-Space Regulation itself. Regulations are hard things to change. I would like to see, commercial operations. I would expect that they would probably be focused on niche areas where there's an obvious business case. And one of the most interesting areas that we're seeing in Europe is harbours and port areas. A lot of processes in harbours and port areas require somebody to get into a boat, or if you were going to do an aerial observation, It's very expensive with a helicopter. So there are many things that people want to do that they cannot. And so I would imagine, as we're already seeing in Rotterdam, Antwerp, and in, Hamburg Harbor, we will see a growth of use of, drones and, implementation of, U-Space or U-Space like currently, but hopefully official U-Space in Harbor areas. This is, I believe, commercially viable today. The other area, which, is a pressing area of interest is delivery, but delivery today in Europe is tending towards suburban, so it's not really an urban activity. And I would imagine that, the kind of pilot projects that we see in Ireland, in Finland, in Norway, we're working with a company called Aviant, which is delivering around Trondheim in a rural area. We would see these increase in number and we would see them being enclosed inside U-Space airspaces. And we will see these U-Space airspaces popping up like, like mushrooms on a lawn. We will probably be a, not obvious why they're there, but then you go and look and you find there's, here in this place, there's a niche where commercial operations are viable. I would say that the, my least expectation is that it becomes focused on urban, in each case. I would say that probably suburban or harbor will be my initial one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:23:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew you've been doing this for a while.

If you, hear some of the stories which are being told about, what people want to do, I would say, is it really realistic to try and compete with ground transport? And you may recall, an experimental project that was done by Airbus, pre COVID, a thing called VOOM, where they set up a kind of on demand helicopter flight service in San Paolo. San Paolo has the benefit of having a large number of helipads, has a quite a large population of helicopters, many of which are sitting idle most of the day, and it also has terrible traffic problems. So there was a willingness among the public, or some members of the public, to pay quite a lot for a short flight and that made this VOOM thing viable. I would say if you're going to come into this business, you need to understand what is the specific set of circumstances where your business will work. And if you come in with a general approach, we're going to deliver cups of coffee. I would say, like really, how can that be better than the man on the bicycle or whatever the alternative is today, you really have to understand what is your value added and where is the niche where that value added is appreciated. And yeah, I wouldn't today be looking at trying to replace or compete with the metro or even taxis in many cities. I'm sorry if I disappoint my colleagues in the taxi business, but really you have to be pretty good to do better than public transport in most European cities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:24:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew this has been a great conversation.

There's an opportunity now to have a new, fresh approach to say, if I'm the customer, the traveler, I want to travel, what is the natural experience for me?

Welcome back to The Vertical Space for a conversation with Eric Leopold a long time veteran of IATA, the International Air Transport Association. We start the conversation, talking about the state of the airline industry and its current priorities such as the post COVID recovery, digital transformation and sustainability. As most of, you know, there are large regional differences in the maturity of the industry and therefore priorities, but we generalize the discussion on bottlenecks that airlines and airports face as the demand for air travel grows and potentially doubles over the next 15 to 20 years. Here we touched on capacity, ground infrastructure, workforce, the IT infrastructure and how advanced air mobility can solve some of these bottlenecks. We also discuss whether the hub and spoke network model continues to be prevalent in the future. Another key theme in the conversation is digital transformation. What are the opportunities on the business side and on the operational side. And how airline and airport CIOs are thinking about prioritizing their budgets across projects. Part of the discussion is the role of generative AI in the travel experience. For instance, Instead of going to an online travel agent to buy your ticket, Eric suggests we might be able to buy our flight in a supermarket or a bank or any other retail location for that matter. Or we might use generative AI and a voice interface to guide us through the travel booking process, one that is more personalized and more in tune with our individual preferences. If you're looking for an expert and pragmatic opinion of the challenges and opportunities that aviation is facing you're in the right place. As mentioned, Eric is a veteran of the airline industry. At IATA he held numerous roles in strategy, digital transformation and standard development over the span of 15 years. His last role was director industry strategy, focusing on the restart of the air travel industry after the COVID 19 pandemic. Prior to this role, Eric was the director transformation for financial distribution and data services. His team led the transformation agenda for the air travel industry, including change programs and industry standards, such as the new distribution capability(NDC). Eric championed the digital airline vision, enabling airlines to become digital retailers and efficient financial organizations. Eric is now the founder of Threedot a consulting firm, providing services to the travel and tourism industries. Threedot advisers, all companies, including airlines, airports, travel agencies, travel tech investors on their strategy for innovation, growth and transformation. Eric holds a master's of science in electrical engineering from central Supelec. A master of science in computer science from Georgia tech. And MBA from ESEC. And a diploma of the advanced management program in air transport from Nanyang university. Eric is married, has two daughters and lives in Geneva, Switzerland. I enjoyed the conversation with Eric after a brief sponsor message. Eric, welcome to The Vertical Space, it's a real pleasure to have you on the show.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you, good to be here.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is there anything that few in the airline industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's interesting. Lately, I would say, when we're talking your future of travel, some people, most people now are quite pessimistic saying that, sustainability, we have to reduce flights, etc. And I think that there's going to be a breakthrough, that will make air travel sustainable. It reminds me when, for cars, you need a Tesla that says, we can do electric vehicles or for COVID you had, you need a Moderna or another one that says, we can have a vaccine in one year and not 10. So you need a breakthrough. So I think we'll see a breakthrough in the coming years, but unless it happens, I understand most people are pessimistic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What breakthrough do you see happening and how is that different from what most people in the industry think?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, most people see, that, to make aviation sustainable, so that people can travel in the next generation, we've been using the last two generations, is that unless, you have, sustainable fuels, so two thirds of the fuel will be replaced by what's called SAF sustainable fuel. The rest may be hydrogen or electric for short haul. That to me does not take into account, this scenario doesn't take into account, like a major breakthrough, like conversion of, sun and solar energy into, fuel creation or something that is impossible today. And I think what people are missing is the same people who said solar impulse is impossible. Flying around the world, with a solar plane, everybody said it's impossible. And there was a few crazy people like, like the ones of Solar Impulse, Bertrand Piccard, who said, I think we can do it. And that was the breakthrough. So I think it will come.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is your breakthrough, Eric, is it going to enable more sustainable flying? So there are people who question, obviously electric, electric is not going to happen with anything close to wide body for 20, 30 years, and, many question hydrogen for a variety of reasons, and sustainable aviation fuel, although a good idea, it's going to take a long time to get what we need. Is your breakthrough going to enable sustainable flight, or is your breakthrough in that area that, if you agree with you on, enabling some other part of air travel transportation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But first, I'm not sure what the breakthrough will be, so I know there's many people doing lots of research in many different places, and I don't know which one, will come, but if I look at electric engines and what I studied, 30 years ago, and what I still see today mostly, I don't see major progress. But now with all the attention that you have around those electric engines, I would expect, much progress in the coming years, same thing on batteries and so that's one part. Also on creating new fuels, we had decades of, fuel production one way. And now that we put much more research on that I would expect breakthrough there. So I don't know which one will be, the first one to happen. I just think if you meet again, and we speak again in five or 10 years, we will say, Hey, look what happened. I've been like, post Tesla, post Moderna, it's, or even, the, all the Uber and the, Uber was crazy before it was invented. You would never you put your kids in the car with somebody you don't know, and now it's maybe the safest way to, drive around. So it takes 5 10 years to, shift those mindsets, or to have a breakthrough. So I don't know, what exactly what will be, but there must be something happening in the next 5 10 years that will change the way we look at sustainability in air travel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's interesting that you compare this to the vaccine production. Do you feel like the question of sustainable air travel has the same level of urgency in the population? I mean, clearly it doesn't. so the question is, humanity put their brains together when there was an existential threat, which in this case, is probably not at that magnitude.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, you're right. The, RNA and all the things existed before, but there was no, appetite politically to try to take any risk and fast track adoption. And of course, COVID accelerated that. So there's probably not the same sense of urgency. for, sustainability in air travel. That being said, there's, big diversity, and differences, around the world. There's regions of the world where sustainability is clearly not the priority. Everybody understands what is happening, climate change, global warming, etc. But it's a matter of priority. And I think it's in the regions of the world where sustainability is on top of the agenda. That's where you will see, most of the funding and research, et cetera, going into, that area. Because when they look at the benefits and costs of aviation, benefits are huge, but costs, environmental costs are huge as well. And unless we mitigate that, the cost will be higher than the benefits. And it's true in some parts of the there may be decisions to say, aviation is too costly. so we should, decrease it or stop it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm sure we'll come back to that in a moment, but before we do, let's, just frame the conversation with your assessment of the state of the market for airlines and airports, if you would.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The state, of course, the big topic, in our, I call that sector, if you want, of aviation, is the post COVID recovery, and, that's the big topic. Demand is back, back at, end of 2019 levels. So that's the big topic. what has changed, I think, there's some safety incidents that are happening and that are quite worrying for, I think, people who are watching this closely, but even for the general public. There's, I think, a growing and bigger focus on sustainability, as we just discussed. I think even before COVID, we were still, talking about greenwashing, lip service, due to that. I think now it's, we've moved into real, planned roadmaps, etc. Also the regulatory side, government side, funding, production of staff, etc. So that I see like a real topic now. What's common with other sectors I see is digitization, right? What happened in, during COVID, many people went online and, remote work and all of that. Everything has been digital. We see that also in the airlines and airports, and that's accelerating. There are still parts that are very archaic, but a lot of progress. And the last thing I would say top of my mind is what I just mentioned as well, geographical, differences. You see really, different gaps, for example, between developing countries where, you're building new airports or you're building new runways in the airport or new passenger terminals at the airport. So a lot of still building at infrastructure because, aviation infrastructure builds so much benefits to those, regions and markets. And that's the contrast with the more developed countries where the market is mature, infrastructure is there, it's efficient, reliable, etc. And there's no way you can build a new airport or terminal or a runway or anything else. And, and passenger volumes, you cannot grow anymore. And so you're more like thriving and, Yeah, it's a totally different approach. Last 80 years, I would say, post Second World War, was about, growth of the infrastructure. But it's true in some parts of the world, you've reached the maturity. And so you need to think about what's the next phase of, of aviation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, boy, a lot of good areas to break down and evaluate there. Talk a little bit about the digital innovations and what part of aviation, do you see it on the revenue side, on the ops side? You probably see it everywhere, but what were two or three areas of digital, optimization that, that have occurred or will occur, and how do you think it's going to affect, profitability, and how do you think it's going to affect the traveler?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All, of the above. that, that's what's, interesting is that it's cutting across. I would say, on commercial side, the way airlines are, selling the product or simply, making them available, until today, you still need to go to a travel agency or a dedicated shop to buy your flights and things because it's traditionally being sophisticated and complicated. You can imagine that in the near future, maybe you can buy your flights in a box in the supermarket or you can buy them in any other sites, banks, anybody can sell your flights because it's easier to sell, to connect, to package, all that. The other thing that is interesting, I see evolution around, Gen AI and those new interfaces, these Rabbits that, It's like a phone with no apps and you just, speak with your little Rabbit and you say you know, take me there and you don't even know, what app will be used. If it's a travel agent, if it's an airline, et cetera, it's an AI, an agent will do that for you and we'll get you where you need to be, et cetera. So you don't even need to think where do I find the flights? How do I buy it? That's right. It's, it will happen with those AI agents working for you. So that, that's, big changes and this can happen, fast in five, 10 years. you can say today, if you want to buy a flight, you go to an airline or a travel agent, and maybe in 5 10 years, this has, completely, maybe not disappeared, but completely, changed. That's on the commercial side, and many other, changes. On the operational side, I think one big topic is the access to data, data from, of course, your aircraft, your engines, your et cetera, and being able to process that and use also the same tools, around AI to, to make, forecast, anticipate maintenance, detect, potential issues, all of that, but also a topic I like as well is, modernization of the atmosphere, anticipating, of course, weather, turbulences, et cetera. So that's, that's fascinating. and yeah, many other topics. Yeah, I don't know how much time we have.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Got a lot of time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. it's fascinating, areas, digitization.

I think we cannot have, simple answers like, the middleman will lose cause we've seen, many cases, you have suppliers on one side, customers on the other side, and suddenly you've got an Amazon in the middle or Uber in the middle. Whoever will facilitate supply and demand, becomes a marketplace, et cetera. But still there's this idea that if you've got those smart agents, know, AI type things, that knows what you like, how you like to travel, so it knows about you, and know about all the travel suppliers, hotels, airlines, but also, rail, railways. The distribution system today, they are limited to the data that's been, filed and provided to them. And now you have AI that is, not limited by that. They could find an itinerary. Maybe you should tell them I'm not in a hurry. Maybe I have a stopover you in city. I found a nice hotel. You don't know. So I'm just curious to see how will develop and what will be the new experience. Once have some use cases, then you can see, and it could be business travel, be others. Because you see the pain when you travel for business. You see the pain, in booking the flights, in changing the flights, finding the hotel, all of that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, Eric, been looking at the rabbit too. The booking is pretty steep hill to climb you that it could are a You It's All those things, you know, I just feel like I'm sitting there in the airport, I'm fighting with my phone, trying to navigate through these ever changing, menus and app pages. And if the rabbit could step in and just do it for me, I'd get my head out of my phone. That would be a huge win and, that's it's like first base, right? It's an easier hurdle to get over and, get people accustomed to the AI and allow the technology to be exercised and matured. So, I'm with you in that. I think that there are hopefully going to be a lot of these little steps, a lot of these little points of friction that get taken out by it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You're saying, Peter, as opposed to using the rabbit for the actual booking, where you might want to actually see and put eyes on the different options or pictures of hotels and whatnot.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. the actual booking, I mean, that's such a multidimensional sort of decision that people make, and there's a lot of stuff that the rabbit wouldn't know. It wouldn't have, it wouldn't have that contextual awareness of everything that goes into selecting the flight. But there are these other things that are so painful, and so tedious with the phone, if the rabbit could just step in and do it, that would be awesome.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, what do you think about using a voice interface for the actual booking part of the travel planning?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. if I take one example here, SeatGuru, SeatGuru, it's nice. You just need either the app or know how to use it and again, input your flight details and look at different configuration. All of that is painful. Now, either you have a travel agent who knows all that stuff. Fine, good luck, some do, or I say, call it Rabbit, call it Siri, call it any of those AI. And if you train them well, so they will be like, I remember, speaking with the guys at Alexa, they said, I don't remember how they call it, like a skill, there will be a skill in Alexa that understands, travel experience. It's trained and it will go through SeatGuru, it will go through all of that, it will learn your preference, etc. And it will help when you're doing the booking, and maybe some people will say, I still want to do my booking, and see the seats, and see options, and see, fine. But maybe while you're doing that, if you have like voice over, you can also use additional assistants that will do all the, as you say, tedious things to improve it. This I don't see like major breakthrough, like you have a new energy or new, other things, but it will evolve, the behaviors and preference of the travelers. And, today everybody thinks it's normal to go on an OTA and put, three letter code origin, three letter code destination, all of that. Yeah, the way we've been doing for the last 40 years, and the reason we do that is because the airline system that were built for travel agents, 50 years ago, suddenly, 20 years ago, somebody puts this layer of booking engine on top, and consumers had to use the same interface that travel agents were using, but it's never been designed for that. So that's why I say there's an opportunity now to have a new, fresh approach to say, if I'm the customer, the traveler, I want to travel, what is the natural experience for me? And just build something like that for me, rather than here is the system we've built for travel agent 50 years ago, figure out a way to follow the right sequence, to find the right seat and the right destination and the right connection and all of that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I heard, Eric Schmidt speak a couple of years ago, and he was talking about, when I wake up in the morning. I can say, where I want to be able to go. It'll know the delays. It'll know the traffic it'll automate the entire process. So let me ask you this. Who is most likely to develop this, and then who's most likely to be harmed from it? You've already said you're not sure, but let's face it. There's a lot of organizations that make money from that friction. There's a lot of organizations that might make money as you step of the way. If we don't want to talk about who will be harmed, who's most likely to make that innovation do you think?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's the Apple and Google of the world, who've got the maps, they've got access to data, they've got all of that. I think that's it. The only reason you know, most people would give you that answer to come back to your first question. Maybe I have a different answer. I think those, Google and Apple, they focus for the right reasons on more generic approach, they give you a map, they give you something generic, but I've never seen them really focusing on travel, the travel experience, all of that, because It's a niche, if you want, and it's complex, and it's etc. I still see an opportunity for, a new brand, a bit like an Uber, Airbnb, if you want, that would come. And the opportunity you have, something I believe since I was working at IATA, it's a digital identity. When you travel, long distance, road, cross border, your identity is key if you want, because you need to identify yourself at the airport with the airline through immigration all the time. So that's the one thing you need with you. If you, if this, key, this identity that, could be, what is going to be what everybody has when they travel, and if you find, could be again an agent, AI agent, managing your identity, from there you can build on that. You say, now I know who's traveling, and I know your, how to contact you, and I know your trips. Then I can start anticipating disruptions. I can anticipate all of that by connecting to, all the parties. And I centralize. Remember App in the Air? that was that type of disruptive app. The App in the Air could have been that. and there's others, apps like that, that could be the breakthrough I'm talking about. Like suddenly all international travelers, they say, hey, that's the key to have a smooth travel experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, do you think that this is necessarily going to be a new entrant in the industry that brings this technology to market?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My guess, based on my experience, is that it's easier for new entrants to innovate and go across what they do. I see airlines, it's very difficult within an airline to rethink different You know, activities on an airline, whereas if you're, even if you're Apple, you say, you know, I make computers, but tomorrow you can make, you know, movies, or if you're Amazon, you can make whatever you want. You're not limiting yourself, in, in one sector, whereas airlines, apart from AirAsia, tend to say, I'm an airline, so I'm in the business of flying, Metal Tubes. And except AirAsia who says, yeah, I can deliver food as well, I can be a bank, so that's why I say I don't see airlines doing it. Digital companies, even the innovative ones, again, Apple, Google, they are, it's not because, Google want to do social media that they are good at it. So, you know, Again, they are at their limit. So, I think the best way is to, find a few innovative people put some capital behind and build something scalable. That's how I see, again, all the examples we know. I mentioned Tesla or SpaceX. You know, AirBnB and Uber. We have, in the last two decades, we have lots of good examples of you start from scratch, you build the thing that people need and want. And in one or two decades you bring it to maturity. So that's what I see coming. That's what I call the breakthrough. And we've seen a lot in the last, 10, 20 years enabled by technology. There will be a lot. And like all the eVTOLs, all those new electric aircraft vertical takeoff landing, maybe it's going to be, Airbus, Boeing or NASA, but again, they've got lots of other issues. So I guess we will see one of the new entrants. One of the new players, having a breakthrough and building the one that has, good batteries, good efficiency, low noise, good range, all of that. And you say, wow, that's good. whether they will acquired by somebody else that I don't know. There's not many who say I go from zero to 1 trillion all the way. But that is, I think, innovation usually tends to come from innovative companies that don't have all the bureaucracy and burdens of all the big companies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, when we think about the growth of the industry, are there any drivers of this growth in the post COVID era that are new to the industry as opposed to what we have observed in the past? I mean, Traditionally, it's been the growth of the middle income class. It's been urbanization, and it has followed roughly GDP growth. Is there anything different, outside, let's park the decarbonization, new drivers that are impacting the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, the short answer is that the usual drivers, you mentioned GDP, the reasons why people travel, and why it's convenient to travel by air. Those fundamentals, don't change because of COVID. I would just maybe give one example where it's changing. Is, the relation of people to work and work has been, something you do in one place, more or less. And, with remote work, and we need to see where remote work goes. But with all technology that enables you to work, from anywhere. This may have a significant impact, and even on, most importantly on business travel. Because sometimes you don't need to travel for business as much, et cetera. But then there are some people, because they don't see each other as often, maybe they travel, for meetings differently. So again, maybe it's too early to say the shift in business travel. That would be something that's different post COVID, because the relationship to to work where you work remote work, has changed. But for the rest, I think, fundamentals have not dramatically changed to covid, I mean not, not impacting the growth. What is impacting the growth, as I said before, is that I think we've reached in some, markets, not completely, but at least the infrastructure that was growing. population is not growing anymore, why grow the capacity if GDP is not growing as fast as before? And the population is not growing, et cetera. And it's, aviation is moving people in goods. That's it so it's growing in the regions where you still have that GDP growth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. But arguably people in those other regions want to come and visit as well. So you end up perhaps having an infrastructure problem. That's a question actually that we wanted to also discuss. what do you see as the major bottlenecks to the growth of the industry?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, bottlenecks. what you need to run this industry, so you need aircraft. So if you have two aircraft manufacturer and one is not able to deliver, you've got a problem of aircraft. Infrastructure in general, as we said, how many people you can accommodate through the air, you have the routes, through the airport, you have enough runways and, passenger terminals and baggage systems and all that. Then you have all the workforce. During COVID there were, young people training for being pilots and then they said maybe there's no, no more airline by the time I finish my training. So they go to something else. So if you don't have enough pilots and all technicians and all of that, then you need, fuel, you need sustainable fuel in the future. And where is the, production of fuel? So that, that's a bottleneck if we don't produce, new fuel fast enough and to fund all this, you need capital. So if the industry is profitable, it's fine. If it's not profitable, who's going to fund it? And some governments, fund it because it's critical to tourism, because tourism is 30, 40, 50 percent of GDP. So they need to flight. Some others, they will say it's not cost effective and, it's not. So was the cost of capital and, and we don't invest. So that's, There's a lot of bottlenecks, lots of challenges.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>According to market forecasts, the industry might double over the next two decades. And so when we think about the infrastructure that is at some places already at capacity, when we think about accommodating double the traffic in the existing air traffic system and airspace, what needs to change to accommodate double the traffic that we have today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So yeah, double the traffic is more top down, right? So if you say I grow, 3% per year of, 15 years, or I should say 4% or 4%, you double in, I think 15 years and 3% is in, 20 years or something like that. That's top down, you assume that everything stays the same and you grow at, 3 4 percent a year for the next 15 years, it doubles. What I was showing in terms of challenges and obstacles is more bottom up. You say, GDP grows, that's fine, there's demand, but are you able to deliver, right? So that's where I see the challenges. And, in some parts of the world, where you have is still high GDP growth and a lot of people don't travel. I think it's quite consistent. I don't know, like even Saudi Arabia now to plan 2030, they got huge plans and they are creating new airlines and buying lots of aircraft and all of that, putting all the resources. It looks like they've got a plan to manage that. I'm, indeed, I'm more concerned in some parts of the world where aviation is more mature. There's no new terminal, no new runway, no new nothing. But still, there will be a growth in demand. But is it a big issue though? I think if you have already some airports that are saturated, And what will happen is, if, demand is higher than supply, then, fares will go up. And a bit what we see in post COVID, while the fares are up, is because demand is big after COVID. Most people want to travel again and supply is not there because, not all the aircraft and crew and everybody is back there. This I think that's how it will regulate. I don't see fares going down in some parts of the world.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>32:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Eric, some of these locations you're talking about where there's, demand is exceeding capacity, almost today, are some of the same areas where, the advanced air mobility companies want to be able to concentrate their services. And, there's a perception that, we're not going to get in the way of the, existing demand for commercial air traffic in these areas, but they are with today's air traffic system, and we heard Paul talk about where we're at capacity today with air traffic, and then you want to introduce, eVTOLs into these very busy corridors. So this will all have to play together, and there'll have to be some breakthrough on the air traffic control and air traffic management side, you would think, to be able to accommodate it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>32:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's definitely an area where you need to break through because, air traffic management, is built for, certain types of, aircrafts and pilots, etc. Once you have new aircraft where either remotely piloted and pilot is not in the aircraft or even autonomous aircrafts, there's no pilot. All that, you don't have an infrastructure that's ready. If have more companies going to space and crossing, the space where aircraft are flying, you need also to accommodate all that. So there's many changes. Are we ready today? No. is that a challenge for the next two decades? Yes. and I agree. Here where the market, is for all those, new electric aircraft, short haul, that's definitely where you have the most crowded place, more, more mature, what time is of the essence. And what's interesting is that the, aircraft that are electric, the eVTOL, there are some hybrid, but the electric one, they have a proposition as well in terms of sustainability that's much better and acceptable by the public in those regions. So that's an evolution, but the number of challenges is still big.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It'd be interesting, some of our guests have argued, Eric, for some of the value of advanced air mobility is that the regional airports around these big hubs could act as ways of distributing that traffic. to the regional airport, and even though today it's a less convenient airport than what the major hub would be, with advanced air mobility, because of its speed and because of its ease, let's put cost aside for a second it's possible that you could spread load some of the demand of these big airports to the regional airports. What are your thoughts on that, as part of the value of AAM? I,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would say I have different thoughts, all right? I, at least, is my wishful thinking is that I see the opportunity to, bypass or get rid of the airport and get rid of baggage sortation system, get rid of all that complexity. I'm assuming that those, new type of aircraft will be smaller, more agile if you want, they don't need a runway. So to me, the concept of airport was because you need a runway. So I'm curious to see, those vertiports and other types of places where people can catch, those, new aircraft, but to me, success is that you don't need airports for that, right? and the only reason you go to an airport is because you need to catch, long haul flights. The one that will still use the SAF and will, take you for 12 hours in the air. But all the other ones that are, one or two hours, these, I don't see them going to airports. And baggage, also because it's smaller, so we need to find ways to baggage. And baggage, I see it, I don't think, we need to keep baggage to, traveling with passengers, that's a headache, coming from, regulatory, regulatory times, but I think with, we talk about passengers, but I like to talk about, goods and cargo and baggage. I think the, the new aircraft will carry the, the baggage and carry passengers. They will carry, bags separately. So wherever you go, you drop your bag. like a robot, a humanoid, something like that will pick up your bag, load it into a drone that will, carry the bag, and the bag will not follow you necessarily. The bag knows where you're going, and the bag will meet you at your hotel, your destination, wherever, and you don't need to travel with your bag. And it's not been the case because for security reasons, but I think we can have advanced screening systems that will solve that. So that's more where I see the future. We have, if we just replicate airport baggage systems, all of that, I think we missed an opportunity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, the technology community a lot who are working on these technologies think about the hurdles to adoption primarily as other technology hurdles this is how design new AAM vehicles routes for their early deployment or strategies for early decarbonization and changes to operation and infrastructure that would, take place commensurate with that. But in reality and from your perspective, you see the other non technological hurdles, the, organizational hurdles, the groups whose jobs are, going to face a lot of change that they're resistant to, etc. we've discussed a number of these in, this talk so far. When you look at it from that perspective, what do you see in terms of those other types of hurdles and what areas are going to, surprise us and encounter a lot more resistance from your perspective than perhaps, others assume.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, there's a lot. Yeah, technology to me is always, just, one element, but when technology comes with a breakthrough, that can change the whole game. I think we talked about demand. Is there demand in many markets to have different type of travel experience? In terms of speed, experience, comfort, also cost, etc. So this, I would tend to say yes, and I would guess most people would say same thing. Talking about hurdles, I can see how regulation is going to be a hurdle. Now, I don't see that as a negative, so what I mean is that the day we manage to have the regulation in place, it's going to accelerate. I remember, before GDPR, there was no regulation on data and you could do anything, but it, I think, was not good. And once you play rules, then everybody can play, and it can accelerate the spread. And I see if we can have global and harmonized regulation for AAMs and all of that. That, to me, would be a big accelerator. Most people see, a regulation as painful. I see it sometimes in something as standard. it can accelerate global development, global rollout. I see a lot of innovation and where I see a challenge, it's, bridging innovation. So many, innovation in airframes, engines, batteries, everything, but bridging them with the operators. And by the way, who are going to be the operators of the AAMs? is it going to be airlines? Is it going to be the aircraft manufacturers themselves? Remember when Tesla, created Tesla, and they say, the robo taxi, we are going to operate the taxis, because they can automate themselves and drive themselves, so if if you're a manufacturer of drones, are you going to become the operator of the drones, or will there be other operators? As long as that is not, clear. if you have new technology, who do you sell it to?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>the type And, I think it's clear that most well capitalized of those companies have generally been ones who are talking about model where they operate the vehicles that they manufacture. adds complexity, it does allow them to, capture a second node value chain and they would argue, create a lot more value along with you end up with the, the technology being brought into the market in a very prescriptive way. I have just, for a long time thought that we're going to learn a lot from customers and operators in terms of how they are going to use these aircraft and, in what scenarios and what new opportunities it will create for them. Things that they can see from their vantage point that, those of us, even in the aerospace industry, are just too far away from it to see it. And so I'm really interested in the companies that are bringing forward something that is a little more multi purpose, placing it in the hands of customers and then, seeing what happens and improving the product and building version 2 on the back of those insights. But, something I'm interested in your thoughts on are what might be, from your vantage point, the use cases for these aircraft, even in the early days when manufacturing volumes are necessarily going to be, pretty moderate, tens or maybe hundreds of units produced per year, but certainly not high scale for, high scale mobility networks or for deploying across many, urban areas in the world in the early days. And so is there a use case that you see from your vantage point that is inherently compatible with that? And that, in fact would deliver insights and also help build the maturity and the conviction around it to, fuel the scaling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What makes sense to me in terms of use case, I would say, use case for passenger and use case for goods. For passenger is, where time is of the essence and where connectivity as well matters what makes sense is like feeding airport. So if you have long haul, connections and, how do you increase your catchment area and you control, who's going to be there on time because the traffic in the air is, quite more predictable. That I see, a good use case, and that's what to me justifies why some of the, current airlines, see that as an extension of their business, but it's just, one. And that is an example that does not address, what we were saying is that if you're a manufacturer of, of the AAM, or the new aircraft, and you want to operate them, themselves. And if you have some operators who say, but I'm only interested in, I want to operate them. so what happens? All right. So that's why I see room for manufacturers and I see room for operators and maybe some would combine, but some won't. So I see both happening. And on the cargo side it's even more interesting, I think, because you have cargo operators, you have manufacturers, and both may operate, the, the cargo drones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's interesting what you observe about the catchment area, because for a major hub that's a high density place and it's going to be difficult to integrate a significant amount of AAM traffic into that airport, even if that traffic is from further away, regional air mobility providing connectivity into the airport I do see the opportunity for an aircraft that could deliver value because it can fly a longer distance than people comfortably want to drive to get to the airport, but not so far that someone going to take an existing connecting flight today then there's an opportunity, but integrating into a busy hub is going to be hard. So maybe it's medium sized airports or airports that are aspiring to take on a hub role in the network as it grows, but they're not there yet. And, they want to serve a larger distance around them in that area, or there might be bodies of water or other geographic hurdles that make it harder to access that airport from a wide range of areas via car. Maybe that's the early sweet spot for where to sort of build the repetitions and the experience with these operations rather than doing it in, you know, like New York or other giant cities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:43\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I'm curious as well. I see it happening in New York. I mean, You know, because it's congested and traffic is an issue and you want something, you know, predictable, reliable to go to the airport. so that, that's one thing. And also it depends if you can have an experience, smooth experience. So, where you land at the airport is convenient. are you already airside when you land? that type of things could be, you know, small things, but that. Make a difference if security is a pain point. So you can imagine you clear security, and even immigration. I don't know, when you board the smaller aircraft. So this to me, yeah, it needs to be looked at. That's for the large hubs, New York and others and also smaller, like, Nice in France, near Monaco, meaning that you commute, by car, it takes, an hour or two, and, flying takes five minutes. So that already exists with helicopters today. Where I live is in Geneva, Switzerland it takes, two or three hours to go in the mountains it will take, 15, 20 minutes. Which is, changing the patterns. You don't go there for the weekend because it's, it doesn't make sense, but maybe tomorrow you will do. I think there's different use cases per, I'd say, geographical situation and size and etc. And I know there's many people who've done all those analyses. Maybe I don't see, consistency. back to what should I have to do? But this, you know, ways the association, that comes with, harmonized, data sets around, what, how AAMs will, operate that. I think that's still up for discussion and the sooner we have some clarity and alignment between stakeholders on that, grow. myself in the shoes of an investor, america too much uncertainty. So you that where to your money, with i, I think one of the challenges that is reduce uncertainty. We need to regulate makes sense on safety, security. We need to harmonize standards, all discussions, more we clarify, the more we use you better it will be investors and the faster it will take off.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you look over the longer time horizon, and looking at the air transportation network whether in Europe or North America do you see we are, locked in with the existing number of hub airports or should we expect small airports are going grow their traffic and become additional hubs and will this hub system persist? Or do you think it, it will have more of a point to point element in its structure, especially as regional air mobility, is added to the network in addition, just assuming that. What do you think?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's the hub and spoke and point to point so that's one topic that's a lot of discussion around that. I still see the hub and spoke connecting short haul, regional and that type of aircraft to long haul for people and goods that need to travel long distance because it's still different types of aircraft and now fuel etc. So this I still see. In the market that I would say already mature, it's not the same airports that will be developed. I think it's a new, type of mobility that, that will be developed. That's where I don't think we should call them airports. We need to find a different word because there's no runway, there's no baggage system, there's no, so it's a different animal there. Whereas in some part of the world, we're still developing countries, where they still need to grow the infrastructure they are building and they will continue to build for the next 10, 20 years, more airports, passenger terminals, runways, etc. The way we know them today. until they reach something in infrastructure that covers their travel needs. Now, if I compare, railway infrastructure, the time it takes, the cost, again, in some parts of the world, you've got mature railway infrastructure, high speed rail, etc. Fine, it's mature, it's there. In the rest of the world, it's still faster to create a new, route connection, point to point, by air then to build a high speed rail. Now, China has demonstrated they can do it fast but not every country has the same resources. This will be interesting to go, market by market. I'm doing some work in India right now. I see air growing faster than railway for sure, and new markets, like Saudi Arabia and others. It would be interesting to see if there's a coordinated plan to grow, roads, rail, and air in a coordinated way under transport, or is it going to be, you know, chaotic at different speeds? So all of that, and I don't have the answers, but that's all the topics that I'm interested in and I'm watching.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's, talk about digital transformation, Eric, how do you see the state of digital transformation of the airline industry? How far is the industry in this process? What's proving to be easy? What's more difficult?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That reminds me of a project, it was just before COVID, it was, digital maturity of the airline industry. Because in one of the meetings, and we, we said, but how mature is the industry? And how do I know if my airline or my airport is more digitally mature? And what's the end game? how do I know that I'm a hundred percent digital and stuff? What's a digital airline? And so all those questions. We had no answer. So I said, we're doing to my knowledge. It still doesn't exist. so I don't have the answer but I remember when doing the exercise, yeah, you clearly have a industry agenda in terms of digital transformation. What are the top 10 things to do if you're an airline and if you are a CIO, where do you put your money in the next, five, 10 years? So yeah, this exists, in my previous life I was running the digital group, in IATA. So it was, 15 CIOs of airlines. And that's exactly the topic, we discussed is, what are the priorities that are, valid for, airlines in terms of digital transformation? But the name of the group was the Digital Transformation Council, so that was, that was it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what are you hearing from the CIOs at airlines and airports? How do they view the priorities in terms of allocating capital?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I still, do that, now, interviewing them and, looking at it So, you still see differences between regions, between size of airlines, et cetera. So of course that varies, but overall, you can categorize different ways, but I would say there's, something we touch upon, so there's everything on the commercial and, customer side, how do you make the experience better? How do you sell more? How do you grow revenue? So that's, there's a lot around and we talked a bit about, retailing and talked about identity. We didn't speak, for example, about, Virtual Interline, but how do you connect all the different modes of transport? And that would be true as well if you have different type of operators that are created. So that's interesting. And data, we talked a little bit, but all data analytics, AI, all of that. So that's interesting. So that's all on the commercial, customer side.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sorry to interrupt you, Eric, but do you mind going just a few levels deeper and maybe give some more concrete examples?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure! Yeah, so first, first topic, was the retailing part it was, how do I sell, more and better? What we mean by that is You know, airlines have more or less fixed assets, so you have this number of aircraft and seats, this number of rotations, so how much revenue can you generate per seat, more or less, right? That has not been a question for a long time, it was regulated. But in the last, 20, 30 years, and with the low cost carriers, et cetera, it's been a race to say how much you can generate. And that's the growth of ancillaries, the unbundling of the products and all of that. And I think we are just scratching the surface. It's the beginning. other industries that are much better at selling, cross selling and all that. And many industries are better also, understanding customer preference or building subscription and many other things. So it's just the beginning of that. So that's, I would say, high level on the retailing side generating more money per seat, per customer. The next one was, digital identity. So I touched on that. What's interesting is the, on the, ICAO side, so on the United Nations, on the passports, is the, the future passport we were, we had the basic paper passport, then we have the biometric ones, and now we are moving to, the virtual ones, but really the ones that you can put on your phone. Alright, so you don't need any physical documents at all. So that will be interesting in the way to dematerialize the identity and how you can connect that with other forms of ID yeah, so that connect to loyalty, connects to payment, connects to many other things in the airline. So that's, one big topic. Next one yeah, we said interlining, virtual interline. So, airlines are quite good and they've been good the last, I dunno, 50 years connecting, traditional airlines together. So you can buy one ticket from one travel agent on multiple airlines and you pay once for one ticket, one currency, and to travel on different airlines from different countries. And your bag is going from airport to airport, and all that. So that's what's called interline. So it's the equivalent of roaming in telecom, or bank transfers in banking, etc. How to extend that beyond the traditional airlines to any other mode of transport? So that's interesting area and the last one was, on data. Yeah, data analytics. So that's, understanding, customer behavior and then there's a lot of things there. But also understanding, all the flight data. what's amazing is the tracking real time of aircraft. How you see those pictures of, 20, 000 aircraft in the same time. And how you have more and more, data, about flights, about passenger preference about, and all the analytics and what you do to create better offers, that are more relevant. Some people say, oh, you're trying to increase the fares. What's increasing the price and the fares is supply and demand. But it's more, if you understand better what they need, you're going to make the right offer. If you know somebody wants to save time, you're going to sell something that saves time. Or if they want to carry luggage, you sell that. So how do you understand the travel patterns and the customer needs?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ryan on our podcast thought that was one of the big opportunities for innovators, is the use of the data to better serve the customer and lower costs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I fully agree.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, the ones that you mentioned, what strikes me is that most of them, especially on the data side, benefit from data coming off of existing infrastructure and systems, whether this is aircraft, different parts of the airline, operations, airports, et cetera, but I haven't heard many examples of data coming into this system and integrating new technology into what most would say are fairly fragile and antiquated IT systems at airports and airlines. What opportunities do you see there, or, is this such a lot more significant challenge of modernizing these systems that the CIOs are not really prioritizing that kind of innovation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That takes me to maybe the second type of priorities. I call that really IT infrastructure type, right? And that's how you bring, AI into your, all your software. So everything has been rule based, everything has been, process based, et cetera. And also, access of data is, most airlines don't have a lot of access to their own data for various reasons. How do you want to train your AI or do anything like that if you don't have access to it lots of questions around AI. And, I would say, also in terms of, very old software, there are still airlines out there that have systems running from, the 60s, 70s, which at the same time it says how amazing it was because, people built software systems, 50 years ago to run this global industry and it still runs perfectly today. So that, that's quite impressive at the same time, it's scary because you don't have any programmers who understand the code anymore. And I know some, they try to, redevelop it, rebuild it from scratch. They cannot. So that's scary. All right. a good exercise is, when you do your cloud migration and you need to make sure that you have, systems running in the cloud. I would say that's a big, I would say big programs, all those cloud migration. Now if I look at more futuristic topics, so this was more like, infrastructure one, but there, there's still on the IT side is, what will come with like quantum computing what is the next breakthrough? Say if you have, better, faster, algorithms and, computing power. What else can you do? So that, that's also quite interesting. And I would put next to that a topic that, most people don't talk about anymore, which is, Web3, blockchain, and all that. I'm quite convinced it will come back, after all the hype, is gone because what I like there, on the blockchain side, is everything around contract automation, right? And in the aviation industry, there's lots of contracts that is not automated. The ticket itself, when you buy a ticket from an airline, it's a contract, right? And there's conditions attached to it, and if it's all delivered, you pay for it, and if there's a problem, you get refunded. All of that is mostly manual today. It's not manual, I would say. It's not fully automated, right? the dream here is to say, every contract, it could be maintenance contracts, a contract could be, ground handling, could be ticketing, could be all of that. You put everything, every contract, and you automate it, so it's a smart contract. And if there's if it's completed, there's a way to know it's been completed, if it's successful, and there's a payment and settlement, also automated with it. And that will be, again, a major breakthrough once there's a system that can do all of that in many sense, it's still very archaic, the way the whole thing works. It's amazing to think that, many people 50 years, 60 years ago designed and built all that technology that will last so long but it also means that there's a major opportunity to have, massive breaks through there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Given some of the recent disruptions in airline operations due to software. What's the level of urgency when you talk to CIOs and broadly executives around finally modernizing the IT infrastructure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's interesting there is the level of support the CIO gets from the, CEO and the board, right because the day the whole thing collapses. It's not only the CIO who's a problem. And you see that occasionally. It's true for airlines. It's true for airports. It's true for navigation service providers. If you have the ANSP in the UK and they have a problem you're grounding all the flights in the UK until they have reboots, right? So I think, and something, airport baggage system can be completely blocked and nobody gets a bag and, check in can fail and nobody can board the aircraft and same thing with airlines. So I think we've reached a point where the CIOs are doing their best, to prioritize, to find solutions, et cetera. But unless there's somebody, at least the CEO and the board says, we cannot take more risk that we have a major failure that would ground the entire airline for we don't know how long, we need to make this major transformation, digital transformation program that would put us in a safe ground. Once you said that, you say, I wish I could start an airline today. And the question is, if you start an airline today, what system do you take? Right? So you've got two options. Either you take the systems that are proven, that were built, 50 years ago, and you say, wow, I'm going to do that. And the day I finished implementing, I already start thinking how I phased out. Or do you go with the new generation of systems? But it's unproven at scale, I would say. It's proven in the sense that it works, but it's not been proven at scale for decades like the rest. So that's, I think, fascinating times. And I see CIOs in a difficult situation, not only to find solutions, but to find the support they need to do what they need to do.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you see consensus on those two paths?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see consensus in acknowledging the issue. The issue is different from one airline to the other some airlines, they had their own IT, some airlines outsourced to one player, etc. So the situation is different from each airline. That way, there's most diversity is in terms of skills and visions of the CIO, support from the CEO, and knowledge at the board level. So that's why I would say almost every airline is in a different situation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that while you were at IATA, you managed a project to replace the boarding passes with magnetic stripes printed on paper to an electronic boarding pass. And that took about five years. What are some of the biggest insights from this project and something that you would advise entrepreneurs, as they think about innovating in airlines and airports.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's, that was an example where somebody had the vision, it was not me arriving and I was told, this is what you do, but somebody had the vision to say, what if we could dematerialize the boarding pass and then we said, when we, it's the airlines and the, when they had that, say, yeah, we think it would be something we can do in five years. And it was a major opportunity for a lot of, of course, airlines and airport benefited and travelers also benefited. Each time you have a barcode on your phone, that is your boarding pass and that, comes from there but also lots of, data, the one developing the software, the one developing the scanners, etc. once you have an entire industry that agrees on a new way of doing business or operating, it means that you are going to have hundreds and hundreds of customers around the world that need to comply with it. And it's compliance in the good sense, meaning that it's the, this project of the mobile boarding pass, we estimated we would be saving 1.5 billion dollars every year to airlines and airports, right? So you had the a good reason to do that. There was a very strong business case for that. So yeah, that's the advice. Keep an eye on any shifts in, standards and technology that is happening because it means that everybody in the market will need to change their equipment or their software in the next five years. So thanks for giving me the opportunity to look at the big picture. Sometimes it's scary because you look at all the challenges that aviation is facing and you say, Oh my God, it's, it's going to be difficult and also take the opportunity to dive into some of them. And think positive, what we said about think differently and remember that there's been breakthrough and there will be more coming. And also see, standards and regulations sometimes as the catalyst and the enabler for a lot of innovation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's the one point that you would, want the audience to take away from our discussion today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would say one thing that's for sure is a change is coming in this industry of what we discussed. And when change is coming, you've got like two sides of it, so I've chosen the, call it positive way to see the change. You say change is going to improve things. And be part of that change, innovate, build new things, support the implementation and all that. I, that's why I encourage people, I say, take the opportunity to be, the drivers of the change. It's such, it's also much more comfortable than being the recipient and, and that's it. And I would say I see travel as a force for good that's coming from, you know, 1944, heads of state said, we need to build, international travel, and they recognized that. And now there's a challenge, is sustainability yeah, we need to address this challenge and make sure that travel is a force for good and is sustainable.

The first question we ask ourselves when we're trying to go do something new, whether that's a new location, new airspace, new environment, new weather envelope, new aircraft, all these different things. The first thing we ask ourselves is, what is the level of safety that we need to achieve for these operations and how do we have the confidence that we have achieved that? And early on in the program, we'll say, what do we need to do in order to look back and what does success look like in the testing or analysis that we're going to conduct? Then the next question is, what's the regulatory pathway, what do we need to show compliance with? What are the regulator expectations? And so I think that's something that isn't fully unique to Zipline, but I think is a little bit unique where a number of aviation companies start off with a compliance mindset and Zipline was founded on more first principles than that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Eric Watson from Zipline. Hey, listen, you can't help, but be impressed with the inspiring and important work that Zipline has done with their partners in Africa. With medical and healthcare outcomes that are remarkable. So you'll really enjoy hearing about Zipline and their first platform in Africa. Eric gives an excellent overview. We then transitioned to their work in the United States with our platform two. We discuss how their experiences in Africa helped and contributed to their U.S. performance. We discuss what's similar and what's completely different between the two markets. Listen, Eric is a pro at discussing the U.S. certification process. He takes it from ground up. As if we were starting from scratch, what's required, what has changed throughout the years what's working well and what can be improved and and how the certification process is different than what they first anticipated upon launching the United States. He also discusses where there's been tremendous progress in the last year. I really liked Eric's response to Peter's question of where Zipline sees the operational boundary line between missions they would fly with platform one with their airdrop method versus missions Zipline would fly with the hovering capability of platform two and that type of delivery method. Great response. Listen in advanced air mobility there's always this struggle with product market fit. Many of the players in the market had been accused of having a technical capability and are in search for a market or a problem to solve. It is entirely refreshing to hear that Zipline started with a massive problem to solve in Africa. And from that impressive work have demonstrated success in medical outcomes in Africa are really just amazing What it really comes down to is how that success translates into a bigger, yet more complex and more competitive market in the United States where their unique platform two can deliver with precision on a dinner plate with almost no noise whatsoever. Listen from Eric and how they believe they can compete in this much different market. I really enjoyed preparing for this podcast, their CEO Keller Rinaudo Cliffton is very impressive. And Eric also has a passion and eloquence in telling what they've done and where they're going as a company. But I also like about Eric and perhaps it's just a part of the culture of Zipline is that he positively talked about what is possible versus the hurdles that he faces for example, in certification, where oftentimes we only hear about the hurdles and the difficulties of working with regulatory bodies. Perhaps, it's just another reason why Zipline is having such success. Eric thanks for joining us and to our listeners we hope you'll enjoy our talk with Eric Watson as you innovate The Vertical Space. Eric Watson has been at Zipline since 2016, where he is currently the Head of Systems Engineering, Certification, and System Safety. Two of Eric's proudest moments at Zipline have been helping set up the first national scale drone delivery system in Rwanda and achieving the first beyond visual line of sight operations with an onboard detect and avoid system in the United States. Eric is passionate about moving the UAS and autonomous aviation industry towards safe and efficient airspace integration and including a participation in leadership roles in UAS Standards, Development efforts. Eric has a background in aerospace engineering. And before joining Zipline, he worked designing and launching small satellites and co-founded a start up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, welcome to The Vertical Space.

There's autonomous drones delivering products and dependent upon in different communities just really depends where you are in the world. so I think that's something that some people maybe don't realize or underappreciate and think that it might be some far off distant future, whereas there's other parts of the world that are, depending upon drone delivery services for healthcare, logistics, and other things that really make an impact in the community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you think is the source of this skepticism? We've heard this, as well. There's always those folks who for a variety of reasons are quite convinced that this is not going to work. Obviously we do believe that this is a huge market opportunity, but in your words, what do you see as some of the most credible criticisms and how would you respond?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, I'm not sure if it's, I'm sure there are some credible criticisms. I think most of the misconception just stems from a lack of it being tangible, right? Zipline's delivering, over 84 percent of the, health facilities in Rwanda and as an example, and we've started operations commercially in 2016. So. a number of years of experience doing this and I think for a lot of people in the world, that just feels distant, right? And there are areas in the United States that Zipline and others are, delivering to communities and providing access to different products and in a more efficient, safer, more green way. And I think that a lot of people hasn't been their backyard yet. Right. It hasn't come to them yet. And so it just feels like something that's less tangible and, and feels far off and distant. But in my opinion, being pretty close to the technology side and also having spent, years, working on unscaling this up and partnership with healthcare partners, regulators, different folks, it's really pretty obvious when you see it is my personal opinion, right? When you, if you might see either access that wasn't existent before, right? Didn't exist before and now exists. Or if you see someone order something or need something that's quite small, you need some children's Tylenol delivered quickly and a car shows up on your, in your street, throws the emergency flashers on and a person walks out and hands you a bottle of children's Tylenol that doesn't make a ton of sense compared to just being able to get something quickly and efficiently delivered with the right sized, autonomous, delivery system for the product that needs to be delivered in an efficient way. So I think once you see it and that the system's in action, I think it becomes pretty obvious, but there's just a lot of people in the world who haven't had the opportunity yet to be able to have that experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some have when you look at the operations that WING is conducting and also Manna, in Ireland and starting in the U. S. People who are experiencing drone delivery are, really excited and open and passionate about it. But there seems to be obviously those who drone delivery hasn't touched yet that remain skeptical about things like noise and, how really convenient this will be. Will this be available every time that I need it? So I'm sure we'll get into a lot of different aspects of this in the conversation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good point, Luka. Eric, I can't wait for you to tell the story of Zipline you know, how you started. The work you've done, providing access to important goods to those who have not had access, you know, it's a big part of who Zipline is. You've published, listen, meaningful outcomes in really well-respected journals with what you've accomplished in Africa. Is that what makes you different? Is that why you believe drone services are here to stay?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a great point and it's a great point, Jim. I think that this is a big, this is a big part of it. And it's very intentional, I think that anytime that you're bringing a new product, a new service to the world that didn't previously exist, I think it's important to be very cognizant of what the approach is, And Zipline focusing on some of the biggest problems initially, it was a very intentional thing for us to do. And so it makes for, it, in our experience, it has made for a community that has welcomed us in pretty much every instance with open arms. And so just to make that a little bit more tangible, I was in Rwanda and in 2016, helping to make those initial operations. And, yeah, and going out and talking with doctors, talking with lab techs and, people who ran the pharmacies at some of these health facilities. And when we started operations, I remember very vividly, first of all, just showing up at some of these remote facilities in more rural parts of Rwanda and being received like a, like some sort of rockstar, which is fun. and just being so thankful and so appreciative of the service that we were able to offer to help them complete their mission, like their life mission. and all the cases in my experience has been to provide those local communities with better medical care, And so just us doing our small part to be able to allow them to better execute on that mission has been a great partnership. And, the first piece of feedback that was just every single place that we went to early days was, when are you going to expand from 12 hours a day to 24 hours a day? When we first started, we started 12 hours a day service at, seven days a week through 365, but it was only 12 hours a day. And so that I remember, we were like any startup you're looking for product market fit. and we. we're optimistic, but you never know until you get there and so when you provide a new service to the world, to a portion of the world, and the first bit of feedback that you get is we want more of your service, is a pretty good piece of feedback, So, yeah, I think that's really positive. It's very intentional to, to start in those areas and to focus on those kind of beachhead markets that are maybe most in need or most, flexible and willing to be willing partners to go through any of the road bumps that happened in the first couple of years of a brand new service that you're bringing into the world. But I do think that's a big part of it. And I also think that, that point of enabling access to healthcare products, and then, also we're expanding beyond healthcare products in certain places That's not just the past, I think that we're super excited to expand to, we're now operating in seven countries and three different continents today and expanding on that. So that's, healthcare first and every one of those markets we're expanding into the UK with a partnership with the national healthcare system, this year. We have many of our partners in the U S that we are currently serving and also going to be launching with our healthcare partners. So this is not something that's unique to, you know, only certain parts of the world and it's not something that is Zipline's origin story, we're going away from, right. This is a core part of who we are and we're really excited to continue that mission.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, what was that discussion like around the table back in 2016 to bet the company on going so far away from home and picking Rwanda? What were the risks or the objections around the table that came up and how did you guys work through to that decision?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's a great question. So I think there's a misconception out there that we picked Rwanda. It's more that Rwanda picked us, obviously it's a partnership. It's bidirectional, but, there are a few things that were clear to us back then, and that was that we need to get the service into the real world to get customer feedback and learn quickly. We weren't going to be successful by, staying inside the building, and perfecting a system that had never really experienced customer feedback. That's not how great products are developed. So we need to get outside the building, start serving customers, and that's where we're going to learn. So that was very clear to us. It also was very clear to us that we need to solve the biggest problem first, right? And so that focused in, in healthcare in some of these areas where they didn't have, there were parts of the world that didn't have the best access to healthcare. So that, that had us looking in those areas. But then really, what we did is we ran a bit of a horse race, We were looking with different partners that met those criteria. and then Rwanda took the bet on Zipline. We were a small startup. Especially back then, and for the national healthcare system of, an awesome country like Rwanda, to bet on Zipline was, I think, a really insightful, profound and, risky thing for them to do at the time. and so that was just, it, I think Zipline's culture, we have a bit of a chip on our shoulder, if you will, to prove that this technology, has a really positive impact that it can make in the world and is a big part of the future. And that was just a really big bet placed on us on that partnership from the country of Rwanda and leadership within the country that we felt a personal responsibility to deliver on. which is a big part of us making the decision and going forward. and honestly, it also, the way you asked, the question in some ways, it makes it sound like we had a lot of choices, When you're a small startup, you have to, we didn't have the luxury of having a big, a big treasure chest full of gold, on our side. going in and proving product market fit, proving that there was community acceptance, proving that there is, a real market here was something that we needed to do in order to just to exist for another few years to give it a chance to get to the next level, So we had to be scrappy and pragmatic to go grow, Zipline and improve those things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. I know what you mean. You built a system for that mission, an airplane, with long range with the, airdrop method of delivery, which clearly worked for that mission. As you went through that design process for, what you call platform one where did you assume that that same platform could be expanded to in terms of other missions and markets?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Speaking honestly, that delivery experience, that customer experience has gone farther than we thought it would. We thought that, Hey, flying by and dropping a package in a parachute, into the kind of grass field next to the lab, for example, is this something that's going to, is this a great customer experience? We had some doubts, but it's scaled more than we expected, we're delivering, every day in, in Arkansas, for example, and in partnership with Walmart. since 2021 delivering, both, products from the pharmacy of Walmart, as well as other things from that facility, food, et cetera, to communities in outside of Bentonville, Arkansas, and our customers love it. It's like that same delivery experience has scaled into kind of suburban backyards in the United States. and again, in select communities are really quite well. So that customer experience in that platform has gone beyond what we expected when we were initially designing the system for that, for that specific use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you have a lot of experience flying with that and operations using that platform. Where do you guys now see being the operational boundary line between missions you would fly with platform one and with this airdrop method versus missions you would fly with the hovering capability and that type of delivery method?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So maybe a little bit of background here, just to catch him up who might not, might not know. So Zipline is developing, a platform two system as we call it, and and that system is focused on home delivery, as a vertical takeoff and landing electric aircraft, hovers to take off transitions to fly on the wing and then transitions back to a hover delivery site. Lowers what we call a droid. It's like a cute little robot hanging on a tether down from the aircraft that goes into the delivery area, identifies the right delivery site and leaves the package right where it's needed, whether that's your backyard table or somewhere else. so anyway, that's the, that's that next generation. Quick verbal description, pictures worth a thousand words. So feel free to look it up, but quick verbal description of the platform two system. and yeah, but great question. So we, the platform one system is really designed for long range missions, And so that is instrumental in, positively impacting, the healthcare system and, with our partners, which could be with national healthcare systems, or it could be, local, in the United States or other places, more like local networks, healthcare networks, and it's focused on more rural areas, the edge of suburban, some suburban areas, and then platform two is focused on urban and suburban, home delivery as, as well as moving products, Like lab samples between hospitals and more urban settings. and so that's the distinction is do we need long range and, and also have the ability for, dropping the package into a bit of a bigger area, or is this a shorter range, more dense area that really needs the high delivery accuracy and honestly magical delivery experience of the Platform 2 system?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Over the last year or year and a half, a lot of people in the industry, have been surprised by how much demand is and will be coming from home delivery, suburban delivery of high volume, low value goods like food, like coffee. When you look back to 2016, how did you prioritize these markets? what were your expectations in terms of, the growth opportunity for the healthcare B2B delivery versus Consumer B2C delivery.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We've been very focused on, on the healthcare space as supply and, upbringing that's core to who we are. with that said, and we think there's a real viable business model there that, that can scale. with that said, I remember, Amazon stated about 85 percent of products that they deliver are less than five pounds, So there's a clear need beyond healthcare for instant logistics and instant delivery of all the types of products and some of the ones that you just mentioned, retail, food, et cetera. And so we firmly believe that there's an opportunity for drone delivery and, Zipline being one of those providers to really make a positive change, not just inside healthcare, but be able to, make a positive impact for these other spaces as well, to deliver goods to homes, and other places, but, to homes that are in a more, in a safer, quieter, more efficient way than the current, mechanisms that are used for those deliveries.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric was your Africa experience, a net positive financial experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, there's no way that Zipline exists today without our experience in Africa. so\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But was Africa profitable.

Yeah, there's a, you know, listen, there's a part of me that says, why not just do that everywhere, delivering service to more remote areas. You know, you don't have the same air traffic issues you don't have the same certification issues. Your outcomes are through the roof. And, an argument can be made, just keep doing what you do really, really well, where there's a clear use case. But if you're not making money doing it, then that would explain why you would want to get into a more crowded space.ableit potentially a large market.

So we're super excited that we're able to sustainably serve the communities that we're serving in Africa and everywhere that we operate. Zipline has, I think it just comes to the aspirations of the company, we're focused on enabling an instant logistic system that serves everyone equally in healthcare and beyond. And so while we are excited about the, both the mission and the business aspects of serving, communities that may have access challenges, there's more, There's, there's more that we believe that supply can do to positively impact the world than that. And so we're focused, not only on continuing to expand and scale those operations to, expand that positive impact, but also looking at, we feel like we're uniquely positioned to be able to make a positive impact in other areas and in other markets. And so that I think is the main reason for the expansion beyond those initial use cases is that, we're super excited to, to be able to do more. And it isn't a shift away from those core use cases. but it's more of an addition adding on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, can you give us a sense of the kind of utilization that you were able to achieve in Africa and, ballpark cost figures per delivery?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, super excited and a huge shout out to our operations teams in a lot of these markets that really blow me and a lot of the rest of the team away every day. we designed our, platform one system we thought initially that doing, if we could only do 150 deliveries in a day, that would be amazing. That'd be a huge impact. That'll be great for the business, great for the community, and we regularly do over 400 deliveries a day from a number of these facilities without really making many design changes, without doing much, just the operations team has found opportunities for improving efficiency, integrating, smoothing demand, integrating in a really creative ways with local healthcare systems. yeah, it's been really powerful to see the demand from the local communities just continue to increase, and that not just being within, the products we started with. We started in Rwanda, for example, we started with blood products. We expanded To medical products, medicines, vaccines, and, those are basically three of the core product categories that we serve in our, almost all of our communities that we serve, but also expanding into areas that we never really imagined, or at least didn't think would come this quickly. One example of those is animal husbandry, where we're delivering. different types of, artificial insemination products and, swine, semen and other things to improve livestock health and efficiency of those systems in these communities, which has a really big positive impact on the local economics, and different things within the community and health, within the community. So there's, it's one of those situations where providing, Logistic system and focusing on an initial use case that is really impactful, but then the creativity of our partners being able to identify other ways to use this logistic system to positive impact the community has increased volume and demand in ways that we didn't really think were on the horizon when we first started.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Eric, the 400 deliveries per day, this is with how many drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oof. yeah, sorry.

So one of the things that we've found is it's really important for success of the integration, into the logistic system to have, really deep buy in and support from the healthcare system that we're partnering with. but also Zipline's really excited whenever we can to bring additional funding into the mix, to, to support those operations. And, there's a lot of very generous organizations around the world that are excited to make a positive impact and see that their, dollars can make a pretty big impact when deployed in partnership with technology like Zipline's.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Eric, how does the experience accumulated in Africa operations translate to your aspirations in the U. S. and specifically how the FAA looks at this experience and, gives for lack of a better word, credit, towards certification and towards operational approvals in the U S what we have heard is not just, relating to Zipline, but, you can extend this, to military operations and other internationally operated, companies that wish to come to the U S that, yes, there's definitely a nod to flight heritage, but at the same time, there's pushback in terms of the operations not really being conducted in the complexity of modern and busy airspace systems, such as the national airspace system in the U. S. and so in your conversations with the FAA, how difficult of a conversation has this been and how have you structured and conducted and analyzed operations in Africa to make sure that it will be. acceptable to the FAA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a good, it's a good one. So two different things here. First is the positive impact on Zipline, we've learned a ton across the operations that we've done to date. we've flown in total commercial operations, serving our partners 65 million miles, more than 65 million miles, which is over 2, 500 times around the globe. I did the math recently, blew my mind. and so that much flight experience brings back a lot of learnings, And so we have continued to improve our product, improve safety, improve operational efficiency, with these learnings, better understand and characterize the environment in which we're operating in, weather at low altitudes, all of these things. So that's one is just that experience, not the for credit side, if you will, but just the product improvement side is really cannot be overstated. And then the second part of the question around. how is that flight experience, leveraged or considered in, in conversations with FAA specifically, I think that there's been somewhat of a shift here over the last few years in my experience where, I think that we're at a place now that the FAA is much more, taking a much more first principled approach, and much more open to those conversations where, depends what we're talking about, If we're talking about trying to take credit for the, the aircraft's ability to fly through rain, then, rain in Ghana is the same as rain in Utah, So it's very similar. and it, it's dependent on different variables, of course, but there isn't anything fundamentally different. And so it really depends on what is the area in which we're attempting to take credit or asking to take credit. And as long as we're coming in with, rigorously evaluating how does this compare, how does this data compare to the claims that we're trying to make and the operations that we're trying to conduct, then we've seen, especially over the last year, a pretty big shift to the FAA being willing and, good partners and evaluating that, asking the right questions about how is this different and how does this compare, but then as long as we're for, as long as we're doing our job from the first principles standpoint of making sure that, this data does compare, that it is useful in demonstrating this safety claim and that we're achieving these high safety bars, then we have had success using some of that data for credit and working towards FAA approvals.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there any aspects of Platform 1 that would prevent it from flying at scale in the U. S.?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>no, there's, yeah, no, there's nothing preventing platform one from flying at scale in the U. S.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right, let's put a pin on Zipline for now. We'll come back to it, especially as we, talk about scaling operations in the U S but let's zoom out a little bit and Eric, when we talked prior to the podcast about, possible themes, you mentioned that you thought we didn't talk enough about the UAS certification paths. So let's spend some time on that. Perhaps start from the top and let's assume that we want to start a drone delivery operation in the U.S. What are the approvals? what are the certification paths for the aircraft, for the operation? Talk us through the current uh, certification path, and also contrast that to what the potential future processes might look like.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So Zipline is a part 135 certified air carrier in the U. S. The, the reason that, that we are is because currently in order to conduct beyond visual line of sight, parcel delivery for compensation, those operations cannot be conducted under part 107 and the regulatory framework for conducting those operations is part 135. we're a proud part 135 air carrier. It comes with a lot of, a high safety bar, a lot of, safety based and operational processes. And the design approval side of that operational certificate that we leverage is, Section 44807 Exemption. And this acts as the design assurance side of what is the UAS, not just the drone, but the system that we're bringing in to conduct those operations under. And this is an area that has, when it comes to part 135 and also the design approval side there's been tremendous progress made over the last year. I think 2023 was a really big year in the U S and in partnership with FAA for not just applying, but I think for the industry as a whole in streamlining the processes towards demonstrating those high safety bars. For the high safety bar for those operations. And we're really excited about the progress that we've made over the last year, as well as we think this is just going to continue, all signs are pointing towards this, just further streamlining and becoming more efficient and I think an important thing that, the FAA in my opinion is really leaning into is, defining and maintaining a high safety bar, which is, all of our goal. but I think the FAA is moving in a direction that is more flexible in the standards and approaches for an applicant to demonstrate that they're achieving that high level of safety, Which I think allows more room for enabling innovation in the space. And I think, this could be in opposition to, or counter to really prescriptive set of requirements, So this is more, I think the FAA is moving towards evaluating what is the level of safety of the proposed operations and is that achieving the safety bar, that we've defined. So there's a shift towards being more into the future. There's an expected movement towards part 108, which is a new regulatory framework that, a draft should be coming out this summer from FAA is what we're hearing and we expect to be a continuation of what we're seeing in the part 135 and 44807 exemption, processes where there'll be further streamlining the approvals that, Zipline and others have worked to achieve under the current frameworks, we'll transition over into that part 108 world. and I think expect a very similar safety bar, but further opportunities for efficiency and demonstrating that level of safety. And I think that, the main change that I expect specifically is a movement towards more statements of compliance from industry to industry standards, consensus based standards. And so that means that there's, those industry standards are really important. And that's an area where Zipline, and others that, that we work closely with are really investing in over this year and into the next year is to make sure that we're set up for success, when the part 108 comes out and things are shifting every, every day they're shifting more towards, how is this approach how is this proposal demonstrating compliance with industry based standards, And so being able to ensure that we're working collaboratively as an industry to set up performance based and first principle safety based standards that then we can demonstrate compliance to is a key part of the future of UAS approvals, in my opinion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the ways that operators obtain a 44807 exemption? Is it typically through the D&amp;R process? Can you talk a little bit about that versus what has emerged as the more streamlined way through the flight standards, office of the FAA?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so Zipline received our first 44807 exemption, through a process that was, different than the current process, I'll say it's an evolving landscape. and that initial approval is carried over into the current method, as far as being grandfathered in, if you will, into the current method. And the current method is a derivative, I would say, of the durability and reliability based approach that you're referencing, where it takes a lot of the, a lot of the components from that, a lot of those same concepts of really thinking about it at the system level, as opposed to, piece part component level, the certification, and design approval. So it's really thinking about the system and let's define the operating environment and the limitations and everything for the system. And let's go demonstrate that this overall system, this UAS can operate safely and repeatedly in that design domain, In that operational environment. And so it is a very similar approach to that durability and reliability approach. I think one of the main differences is that the more classically the durability and reliability approach was done really in partnership, step by step with, FAA and with a lot of FAA oversight, and a lot of FAA agreement on, every document and test plan and all of these things, a lot of witnessing of testing, et cetera. And the new processes are more focused on, being compliant to industry standards and having company statements of compliance to achieving those very similar requirements. but having that slightly different approach has led to an opportunity for, I think, moving change management and initial approvals much more efficiently through the process while still achieving that same high safety bar.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the interesting, moves in my opinion has been, the shift away from dealing with the design. part of the FAA and more with the operational, the flight standards folks, if that is true, if you agree and you see this as well, how are those conversations different?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that there's more of a focus in the last year. Again, there's been a transition within the FAA and how they're handling UAS operations to have more of a focus on evaluating the safety of the proposed operation. And so there can be. that can be very, location specific, there can be different types of mitigations that can be put in place for different types of risk, but it's really thinking about what is the level of safety and is this achieving our collectively high safety bar, or is it not, And I think that is, is a different lens than looking at it from a very certification and compliance perspective. framework, right, of saying what are the specific regulations and is every part of the system in compliance with those regulations, is just a different lens to look through. and yeah, we've been pleasantly surprised with the shift and it's a movement more towards actually looking at the safety of the operations, which is more directly aligned with what I think we all care about at the end of the day. And so I think it's been a really positive shift.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what's the latest in evaluating the safety of the associated elements? What was it, maybe two summers ago that the famous memo landed and the industry, was very surprised. What was your experience like in proving safety and, obtaining approvals for, things like C2 Ground Control Stations. and how is the FAA dealing with it now?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that the. I think approach to associated elements that the FAA decided to take a couple years ago, is much more aligned and works much better with the more current approach of evaluating the safety of the proposed operation. I think it was a bit of a challenge to figure out how we then, handle different associated elements, different parts of the system with respect to showing compliance, to the set of regulations on the design side. But when, with a shift more towards saying, what are the proposed operations and what's the safety of these operations, then it becomes more, it's just more flexible, I think it's just a more flexible lens to be thinking through. And so we've seen, yeah, I think a fair amount of success of having the UA, the aircraft and the associated elements, all being considered as a part of the operation. and when it makes sense to treat them the same, we treat them the same. It wouldn't make sense to treat them a little bit differently. We treat them a little bit differently, and be able to have those categories to, to think through from a first principles safety perspective, dependent on what the proposed operation is something I think is working pretty well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You talked about future Part 108 leveraging industry standards. Where are the missing pieces today? Parts of the operations or technology that the industry is yet to agree on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I think when it comes to industry standards, in my mind, there's two different categories of progress that we need to make. One of them is there are just gaps, If you try and piece together all of the standards to, to paint a full picture, to put the mural together, there are some places where there are just some gaps. So those gaps need to be filled. And then I think another opportunity for improvement is, some of the standards that do exist that are, the right standards in the right areas, in some places they're maybe overly prescriptive or refer back to older processes or older approaches to things. And so I do think there's an element of the industry needs to align on updating some of these standards to be more performance based, and more flexible to support innovation in the space. Again, with that eye towards what is the risk level or this level of safety of the proposed operation? And is that achieving the safety bar? that's what matters at the end of the day. So yeah, I'm excited to, to, partner with other folks in industry. I think that, like I mentioned earlier, Zipline's going to be investing here. I would encourage any members of the audience who are potentially interested to get involved in this space. I think there's a big opportunity to move not only, drone delivery, but other drone applications, as well as honestly setting, in a lot of places setting the framework, for autonomous aviation, in a number of places. So I think it's a big opportunity and having, especially there's room for more operators with experience, more manufacturers with experience to, to join some of these conversations to make sure we're moving these standards in the right direction for the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, across those two categories, on industry standards, can you name some that are your highest priorities, whether gaps that need to be filled or standards that need to be revised?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'll put a plug in here there's a, operational risk assessment standard within ASTM that I'm, taking an active role in helping to update. this was a standard that came out in 2016 and we're planning on updating throughout the course of 2024. So this is something that is really an opportunity to look at, like I mentioned, what is that evaluating the safety of the proposed operation in a really smart way, and the industry, I believe, is lacking on the, an agreed upon process for conducting that type of analysis. And that includes, what are some of the equations that we use, what are some of the data sources that we use. And I think that the FAA has made a big step forward in better defining where the safety bar is. one of those, one example being FAA order 8040. 6A that came out late last year, which is, I think does a, is a big improvement to the previous guidance about where the safety bar is and I think industry has a step to take in order to agree upon what are the standard approaches, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the level of safety of the operation. So this is an area where I'm actively involved. There's a number of areas, that we both need to fill in some gaps as well as make some improvements to, to some standards, especially some that are a bit old and maybe out of date.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are any of these gaps or, missing standards, a direct obstacle for the industry to grow over the next one or two years,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the good news is that we're in a transitionary period, right? And so we're still, while part 108 is being developed and putting into practice, we're, we're still operating in this part 135 and section 44807 exemption world. And. That includes a combination, It's a combination of working directly with FAA in some areas and being able to take advantage of some of the standards that do exist in other areas. And no, I don't think that there's anything that is a direct blocker to industry right now. I think it's more of We need to do the work to set ourselves up to fully take advantage of the, process improvement opportunities that are, being, being placed in front of us. So I think that I don't see anything that's a blocker today, but I do see some opportunities to further accelerate, the industry in the future while again, still holding that high safety bar. Finding more efficient ways to demonstrate that level of safety with initial systems, new operations and new environments, design changes, et cetera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you see that the challenges around Boeing are in any way impacting the FAA, either in terms of their bandwidth or their appetite to engage with the UAS industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, not me personally.

And where we are today I think we're in a pretty good place. I think the industry is in a pretty good place from a, regulatory and technology and level of safety and all of these areas, compared to our expectations when we shifted some of the focus, when we added the focus of expanding into the United States, it's really in kind of 2019, 2020 type timeline. we didn't make as much progress as we hoped, so we got, I think we're at a place that we feel, we're excited about. We think that there's, we're really excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I think it took a little bit longer to get here than we expected to. but yeah, I think that we managed through and really excited about where we are. And I think the industry is in a really right place for innovation and also, scaling in the United States, and beyond over the next few years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And if you said there were two or three things that you took from your Africa experience that helped you operate in the certification world more effectively, what would they be?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think it, I think the main thing, and this is a little bit, zoomed out, but Zipline has always taken the approach of being very first principled when it comes to safety. The first question we ask ourselves when we're trying to go do something new, whether that's a new location, new airspace, new environment, new weather envelope, new aircraft, all these different things. The first thing we ask ourselves is, what is the level of safety that we need to achieve for these operations and how do we have the confidence that we have achieved that? And early on in the program, we'll say, what do we need to do in order to look back and what does success look like in the testing or analysis that we're going to conduct? The next question, once we have that plan, we've identified that level of safety, we've identified the process to get there and convince ourselves. Then the next question is, what's the regulatory pathway, what do we need to show compliance with? What are the regulator expectations? And so I think that's something that isn't fully unique to Zipline, but I think is a little bit unique where a number of aviation companies start off with a compliance mindset. And I think that Zipline was founded on more first principles than that. Starting off with first principles, safety, and then also demonstrating compliance is a key part of it. But making sure that we're setting our own objectives, our own safety bar and ensuring that our operations are achieving that. I think that's something that, is in our DNA, That started back at the beginning of the company and I'm excited to, to see that kind of progress and mature over time, certainly, but I do think it's a key part of ZipLine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric you gave us a high level overview of the P2 platform that's in development. What can you share additionally about the state of the development of that platform?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'd love to rewind the clock a little bit. I'm happy to get there, but in order to get there, I feel like showing a little bit of a origin story, I think might be important to set the stage for how we got to where we are. and so the Platform one system we've talked about a fair amount. Platform 2, we talked about being focused on home delivery in urban and suburban areas. And, this became really obvious to me as a need and the right next step for ZipLine in 2019. When, I was just reflecting recently on when this was exactly. In 2019, I was spending a lot of time in Ghana. working on expanding our operations there in the more kind of remote parts of Ghana and partnership with our, our healthcare partners, operations team, regulators, everyone involved, different airspace operators. And, there was a friend of Zipline, Joe, shout out if you're listening, who kept, he was a doctor, well connected doctor in Ghana and kept reminding me or telling me that, hey, it's great what you guys are doing in the remote parts, but we really need you in the capital city. We need you in Accra. We need you in Kumasi. We need you in these urban areas as well. and I wasn't so sure. I wasn't convinced. and. one thing that Joe did is he said, can I have a day of your time? And I said, yeah, of course. And so he took me around to some of the main hospitals in Accra and walked me into the emergency rooms and some of the places and introduced me and asked the doctors, the folks that, who ran some of those facilities, heads of the emergency room, when is the last time that you didn't have the medical products that you needed in order to, properly care for someone, and even, lost a life of someone that potentially could have been saved if he had the right products. and every one of those hospitals that, that I went to, that, that, kind of Joe brought me to, the doctor had a story within the last 24 hours of when that occurred.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What was the most common answer that they said Was it blood?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most common, yeah, most common would be, yeah, rare blood types, right? Someone in the middle of the night, rare blood type, and just couldn't get it, couldn't find a donor, couldn't find access to the blood bank, in time. yeah, that, that was the most common theme. and so that, that became pretty clear to me that, wow, right, this, we've really been focusing on some of these more remote areas, but there are challenges, not just in Ghana, then we did our homework, we did our homework, looking at other places around the world, and concluded that, hey, this is a, this is also a real challenge. That was, again, for me personally, that was when the light bulb moment happened where I was like, okay, in order for us to accomplish this mission of enabling access to healthcare to everybody in the world, we, we need another solution, right? There's a lot of people who live in urban and suburban areas and we're not serving them properly. And so that was a big movement in that direction. and then, fast forwarding through time, we're, we. Then I've, have been working over the last few years to develop our Platform 2 system. That's focused on solving this problem, Enabling home delivery and operations in urban and suburban areas, with, I think a pretty cool customer experience and delivery experience really focused on, everything you need in order to do that in safety as a top objective, quiet, really. precise and inviting and fun delivery experience. So that's what we've been focusing on. we have a really strong demand, which is amazing to see. We have lots of partners in the healthcare space and the retail space and the restaurant space, a lot of partners, and some of the main feedback that we received from those partners is just, when are you going to launch with us? When can we expand to these customers? and so that's, that's great feedback to have, demand signal from the market. So that demand's great. We've been able to make a lot of regulatory progress. as I mentioned, initial Beyond Visual Line of Sight operations and in the United States late last year, really being something that, that was a big unlock for Zipline. and that was, with our onboard detect and avoid system, being able to allow us to operate in different types of airspace with limited infrastructure on the ground, to unlock those new areas inside and outside of mode C, veil areas. So in, in areas near big airports where there's more requirements for transponding as well as, in areas that are not near big airports where, there's less cooperative airspace. we've now conducted beyond visual line of sight operations in the United States and, both different types of airspace inside and outside Mode C veil, which is huge. There's about a little bit more than half of the United States population lives inside Mode C veil areas. but that also means that a little bit less than half lives outside. and so being able to bring, access and instant delivery to everyone in the world really means we need something that can hit all these different areas. Right. And that, that demand is huge. the regulatory progress we've been able to make, which is, we, we see as a lot of these things being cross platform, it's not an approval for just this specific aircraft in this specific instance, but it's really paving the way, If we have this level of performance of a system, then we agree and we've gotten agreement from the FAA that we can safely operate in these environments. and so now we go design also the next generation aircraft to have, the same or even better level of performance, then, it'll follow that we will to get very similar approvals within the same, part 135 air carrier certificate to operate and add that new aircraft into our operations. And, and yeah, and then as far as where we are in the program, it's just, continuing to develop, bring up the supply chain, manufacturing, flight testing, all of the things that are required in order to set up and have the capacity and capability of the next generation system to be able to meet that demand signal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, you mentioned your conversation with Joe and, you know, I love that story about listen, even in a city, there's a requirement for instant access for certain goods. But how much of your valuation, is a function of your ability to deliver goods to areas that otherwise wouldn't get those goods. You know, whether it be an Africa or whether it be in the United States. Or how much of it is your ability to deliver same day services to the home, for example, where you're now competing in a much more, it's much more of a red sea. Will you always get a better part of your valuation because of your ability to deliver goods that are not easily access to more remote areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's absolutely both. it's absolutely both. I think that there's some really high value use cases that Zipline has been able to serve and, really humbled by the partnerships that we have in order to make those positive impacts in the world so far, and really looking forward to expanding that. I think there's unique value that we can bring into those spaces. with that said, there's also, there are other use cases, And, I, again, it's speaking for myself here. I, pretty recent, I have two little kids at home and pretty recently. I went to the medicine cabinet in the middle of the night in search for some Tylenol to help with a fever. And sure enough, we happened to use the last of the Tylenol the last time that we needed it and had forgotten to get more. and really wished that I could get a drone delivery on my back porch in 10 minutes, in that time. so there, there's those types of use cases\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in that situation, Eric. Great example. What's your competitive advantage? You know, there are a lot of big players now who want to be able to deliver that Tylenol in the middle of the night. Uh, I love how you talk about your ability to quote unquote, you know, deliver on a dinner plate. You're so exact and what you, you can land and because of your droid. But what's your competitive advantage and being able to provide that, is there a cost advantage? I know noise is significant and it's a very quiet aircraft. I know that you can land it on a dime or, you know, on a dinner plate, but why would you be better than somebody else who was also able to deliver that Tylenol in the middle of the night?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, I think there's a number of, I think there's a number of different factors. yeah, my speaking from that experience specifically, right. It's, the way that we're developing Zipline would be a far superior experience to what I experienced that night. just being able to quickly open up an app type in what I'm looking for and have it show up in 10 minutes. It exactly where I want it. Where I, can still just be wearing my pajamas and have my slippers on in the middle of the night. Like that was not my experience, right? The experience was, I was lucky enough to be able to have product delivered, As opposed to having to get in the car and, and go find a 24 hour, pharmacy or whatever it may be. but it. It takes time, So someone's got to be awake looking for that. and then it shows up in a 3000 pound combustion engine vehicle to hand you a, an eight ounce bottle of Tylenol, at your door in the middle of the night. that's just, so some of the things that we're focused on doing are enabling faster, more efficient, more kind of user friendly experiences, as well as being able to deliver on safer, quieter, more environmentally friendly alternatives, right sized for the mission, solutions. And I think that that has a number of different. benefits over the current status quo.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Eric, do you see Platform 2 flying first in the U. S. market, or do you see it flying first in Ghana, against the use case, that you mentioned?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, we're keeping our options open, just to be transparent. we're looking at both, We're looking at both expanding, Platform 2. 0 service in some of the international markets that we currently have, quite a bit of experience in, as well as looking at, bringing the system first to the U S we have strong demand signal in, in multiple geographies and there's uncertainty, there's regulatory uncertainty, there's different types of uncertainty. And so it's just really important for us that we're able to, as fast as we can, deliver on our side of the, bargain with our partners. And so we are keeping our options open and whether or not we go to the US or international first, but I will say that there's been a lot of improvement and a lot of progress made in the US from a regulatory standpoint and also a community acceptance standpoint that we, we've had really positive success with FAA recently, as well as our operations and that we've had in North Carolina, Utah and Arkansas, serving customers and delivering products as have been really well received by the local communities. And that puts the U S on the top of the list, Like that, that, that puts it in the conversation, which is something that in 2016, it wasn't the case, right? In 2016, it really wasn't an option to come to the US first with a new system like this. So we're really excited to see the progress that has been made such that we think that it is a viable option to take a new service like this and bring it to the United States first.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see. Can you share a story with the audience, sort of talking about the design philosophy that has evolved at Zipline, on the basis of starting in 2016? and building Platform 1, taking a very verticalized approach to building it because at that point in time, that was a necessity. And now as you come to design Platform 2, can you tell a story about how that philosophy influenced the design of Platform 2 and perhaps what you guys have learned since you've unveiled it, in terms of development and and testing that's undergone since then?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, this comes back to, I think, this is just a good principle for launching new products and starting new companies is Zipline since the beginning has been focused on providing a service and solving a problem. Not developing technology as the top priority. And so when we started on this mission, we were focused on, enabling access to healthcare and providing an instant logistic system that, that serves everyone equally. And we thought, probably naively that we would be able to go out and buy some drones and buy some, it was the first thought buy some drones and start operating them to, to help, solve these problems quickly realized after buying and testing some drones that wasn't going to work. and so then we thought, okay, we'll be the system integrators. We can go buy, a number of components, avionics, flight control systems, autopilots, assemble them all together, and then we'll have our drones that we can go start solving these problems with and serving these customers. and what we've found over and over again over the years is that, it's really tough to do, It's in order to achieve the levels of safety and reliability that are needed, as well as the kind of efficiency and economics that are needed in order to serve these spaces, we've really struggled in most cases to find off the shelf components that can achieve both of those things, They can achieve the high level of reliability in the really adverse, environmental conditions that we operate in, as well as can achieve the economic efficiency that we need in order to deliver the product that we need in the service that we need to deliver. so that has led to more and more vertical integration and more and more, pulling more components and hardware components, software components, et cetera, in house over time. and I think that's just, we're just doing more of that on the platform two system, as opposed to the platform one system where there are some components on platform one system, even today that we, that we would really like to be able to bring in house. and so we learned on that and kicked off projects to purpose design some of those components for both platform one and platform two. and the, and some of those components are going into platform two first, and then we'll be rolled back into platform one, when we do a design update after they've been proven on the platform two system. Yeah, really excited about some of the opportunities there, and I think that this is a, I think that there's a kind of a, competitive advantages, a bit of a moat here of being able to be a vertically integrated company in this space allows us to achieve the levels of performance, the levels of, safety, these different things that really enable the business and enable the customer experience. I think one more thing I'd add is that answer. The answer I just gave is not just applicable to drones, right? the drone is. a portion, it's an important portion, but it's only a, really a subset, a small subset of the total. Of everything that Zipline needs to do in order to provide our service, right. And if we provide logistic service with our partners, there's also, just to name a few off the top of my head, right. There's the software that's used to manage the fleet of aircraft to dispatch the right aircraft with the right level of battery charge to the right order at the right time. the software that the controllers use, our remote pilots and command use for monitoring the fleet. There's a fulfillment systems that we use to manage inventory. there's integrations with our partners. There's the ordering apps that we build. There's all of the. manufacturing and quality systems. There's, all of the ground systems that we use, the communication systems, all of the things, And Zipline is definitely not a drone company. We're absolutely, a company that provides, logistics services for our partners, and we're really excited about that. and that leads to a lot of vertical integration across the space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, what external companies do you use for any parts that you just mentioned, you know, from UTM to fulfillment and how much of it is home grown and how much are you using partners?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a combination of both. Absolutely. I say that we're quite vertically integrated, but also there are some really important partners that we have that have enabled zipline to make the progress that we have and that we're also excited about continuing to expand with in the future. Happy to name one or maybe a couple, but, I think one that comes to mind first is NVIDIA. Right. we're more and more increasingly, getting higher autonomy on board the aircraft and that requires compute. And so having the latest, state of the art compute on board that can achieve the cost efficiency, mass efficiency, and, compute capabilities that are needed in order to have the, the flying computer that, that a lot of modern drones are has, it's been a great partnership with Nvidia to be able to achieve that and set us up for scaling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about on the UTM side?

Are you using a USS, how does that work?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So on, on the UTM side, so UAS traffic management, we are a part of the Keysight initiative in Dallas and partnership with a number of folks in industry, as well as the FAA and NASA. and we also have, have experience in UTM and in our international markets as well. and Zipline develops our own USS capabilities and, another example of being quite vertically integrated in the space is, developing, building those capabilities to, to interface with other companies and UTM service providers in an efficient way that enables our business.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, quite a number of people that we talked to privately, are expressing skepticism about the P2 design, pointing to the complexity and associated cost of it and wondering whether Zipline can really be profitable in the delivery of low value goods with this kind of platform. What is it that they're missing? How do you respond to something like that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. it's, it's not an easy problem to solve, right? it is a complex, highly integrated system. and we have focused on providing, we focus on that home delivery use case from the beginning of the design and everything that is needed in order to achieve that, the high level of safety and reliability, the, the delivery experience, including really designing for noise, being able to integrate. So we want to be able to integrate really efficiently into our partner facilities to be able to create that. we, the terms we use, create a magical portal in the wall that allows our partners to ship products to where it needs to go really efficiently. So these are some of the aspects that we've been focusing on the design. As far as, some of the potential skepticism, You really need to understand the system that you're designing and what are, what the main levers are, So designing for, autonomy, designing for longevity of the system and, cycles on the airframe, designing for operational efficiency and high utilization. all of these factors, designing for maintenance, right? All, all of these factors are really key and being able to. to bring to life a highly integrated, complex system to be able to serve our partners and achieve the use cases that we're focused on achieving.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are some of the gates either in terms of, utilization or the level of automation or human involvement or, the cost of the overall system, or any other gates that you need to achieve in order to, be able to profitably deliver a cup of coffee with the P2.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, from the beginning, we've designed the system for scale. that means, manufacturing scale, that means operational scale, all of these things. With scale comes economic benefits. and so we're really excited to have, a lot of the partners that we have, across, healthcare space internationally in the U. S. I mentioned, national healthcare system. We're expanding with this later this year and the UK, the Cleveland Clinic in the U. S., and the retail space, Walmart and the restaurant space, Sweetgreen and others. really excited about our partners and how are partners in general are really looking to scale, They're really looking to not just do a demo, do a pilot, see how it's received, but be able to achieve levels of scale. And that's when the economics start to work out, right. Is when you're, is when you're achieving scale with some of these partners and some of these systems, that's when, yeah, the, it can really make a positive impact in the community. And also that's when everything starts to pan out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And when you say scale, what do you assume in terms of utilization of drone, let's say in the unit of hour, is that, 3, 4 deliveries, 5, 6, 7?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I mean, it, depends, right. I'm happy to give some, some rough numbers, but it depends. It depends on how far away you're flying. It depends on the weather conditions. It depends on a lot of factors. But, if we're, we're doing a couple to a few deliveries in an hour, that's a good, that's a good hour for an aircraft. And that includes, getting loaded, flying out to the delivery site, delivering, going back to, get charged and get loaded again. So yeah, being able to do, two, two or three deliveries over the course of an hour is a productive, utilization of the asset.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned NVIDIA and autonomy earlier. It's interesting. We recently saw an interview with ValorEquity, one of your investors. It was a much broader conversation around AI and LLMs, but Zipline came up as an example of the vertical AI investments that this firm is making and how Zipline has an AI advantage. What do you think about this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that our flight experience has allowed us to continually improve our system, understand the environment we're operating in, and continually improve the, reliability, robustness and performance of our systems. and I think that includes. In the autonomy space, That includes in the ability to automate these systems, make them more and more capable and safe and powerful as time goes on. And yeah, I do think that, Zipline does use, artificial intelligence techniques, machine learning, et cetera, in order to. better understand our environment and ensure that we're continually improving the safety and efficiency of our operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How much of AI is used, currently or importantly, how much of it has been used in Africa?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Like I mentioned, we're continually using the flight experience that we have in order to improve the system. And so, yeah, they're, from weather prediction to flight controls, to autonomy and perception. There's artificial intelligence that we've deployed in different aspects of the business where it makes sense. Again, coming back to the basics where. we're not a company that's focused on developing technology because for the sake of developing the technology, right, we're focused on providing a service, and really scaling our operations and the value we're able to provide. And so I do think that we have taken a pretty pragmatic approach to leveraging. artificial intelligence and advances in those spaces in order to further the mission and continually improve safety operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Got it. Eric, as you think about, scaling the operations in the U. S., what do you consider as some of the top strategic decisions, whether this is, where to go, what geographies or, the depth of, of the experience and the capacity, or, the partnerships that you need to create. What's top of your mind from a strategic perspective?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I spend a lot of time thinking about this. I think one of the things that is really important to me and to us, as we're thinking about expanding more in the United States, specifically, is Identifying the markets and the partners and the airspaces and, the weather conditions and all these areas where we can provide an excellent customer experience. And an excellent partner experience. And, and the good news is that there's quite a few of those. it's not everywhere in the world, But there's quite a few of those where we have conviction that, that this year we're able to expand into a lot of these areas and so being able to just being really thoughtful about how do we expand the business in the right communities with the right use cases in order to set up that kind of, magical first experiences with the community and with our partners to be able to have those positive first impressions and then be able to layer on and expand and scale from there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about, relationships with, the likes of, the aggregators like DoorDash? Do you see competing with them or perhaps, partnering with them like, Manna has been rumored to have done in the U. S.?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, we see a ton of demand, for people just want faster deliveries, straight to their doorstep with a great customer experience. There's tons of demand in the space and I think there's different ways to integrate into, that last mile logistics spaces. A lot of our partners, like I mentioned, are in the healthcare world, for both deliveries to, pharmaceuticals to homes, for example, but also for Inter facility transfers of, samples and different things to improve healthcare efficiency, which we're really excited about, but also in the, in the retail and in the restaurant space, there's, like I said, there's different ways that we, that we could integrate in, that a drone delivery system can integrate in. Currently our partnerships are with the, the service providers directly. So we're working with Walmart, we're working with Sweetgreens, we're working with these different, retail and restaurant companies directly to provide, delivery services directly to their customers. So that, that's where we fit into the space, but, yeah, we're just excited to, to make the biggest impact we can to enable, drone delivery and positively impact the environment and these communities. And so we're, we're open minded to figure out the best way to do that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Eric, when you work with these partners and when you think about the rate at which you expand the service offering. What do you see as the rate limiters to the expansion of drone delivery? Certainly in contrast, DoorDash itself was able to expand very rapidly, just because of the nature of the service. But with drone delivery and with the people and infrastructure that you need to put in place, what are the expectations, for what that's going to look like, the rate, and also will it be concentrated on a geographic basis, city by city, or will it be initially more spread out and then filling in with capacity over time?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good question. I think that, I think it's going to be somewhere in between, right, on both of those. So I don't expect that drone delivery will expand like micro mobility did where they're seemingly we woke up one day and there were scooters all over the sidewalks in some places. I think that drone delivery will be very thoughtfully expanded in partnership with, the federal government, with FAA and other partners, as well as with, the local community, but I also think that there's an opportunity to scale pretty quickly, So I think thoughtfully and, metro by metro or neighborhood by neighborhood, but I do think that there's an opportunity to grow pretty quickly. And as far as the, Go wide and fill in or go deep type question. I think the most likely answer is somewhere in between where, there's two, I think there's two different pulling factors. I'm not sure what the ideal answer is or the optimal solution is, but one factor is that as you build a pretty deep network in one Metro, there's benefits of that network, right? There's benefits of being able to provide quite a bit of service. different infrastructure, charging, logistics, all of these things that you really can provide more and more service more and more efficiently in those communities as you go deeper, which might lead you to, go deep in a place before going wide into multiple. But at the same time, we're super excited about the partners that we've, been working with recently and we'll be working with over the next couple of years, and a lot of those partners are regional, especially on the healthcare side, they're operating in certain areas. And so there's a pull from our partners to be able to grow and scale and launch quickly. And so I think there's going to be a bit of both where we'll go into one metro area, work on going reasonably deep, and then, jump in the next, jump in the next.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, what is the next five to 10 years look like in our industry? And how is it different than what most people are talking about today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:14:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I think it comes back to the kind of opening of the conversation where I think one of the main misconceptions is that drone delivery is, and, scaling UAS is somewhere off on the horizon. And there's a number of obstacles that are in the way. and I think that, really it just depends where you live, There are places in the world where drone delivery is here today and is dependent upon. And my expectation of what the next five years, 10 years looks like is, I'm really excited for being able to bring that to more and more communities, So I think that there's different types of aircraft that are, executing drone deliveries in different markets, different niches, that are all, working efficiently together in order to help everyone live a better, more efficient life for the environment, for, safety, for all of these things. So I'm really excited about the, and optimistic about what the future holds in this space and how it can integrate into the next five to 10 years of our life as we grow.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:15:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you've been part of a very successful company for many years. You know, it started in 13 or 14. What advice would you give to our innovators? Our entrepreneurs that are listening. That may be unique.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:15:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the main piece of advice is to an entrepreneur getting started today would be to tackle a real problem, I think that, it's all too often that an entrepreneur comes about with a technology or with a solution, and then they spend their time looking for a problem to solve. As opposed to coming in and identifying, whether that's through their own personal experience and pain points, or, through insight they may have into the market, being able to identify a real challenge and a real opportunity. and I would just recommend entrepreneurs to, to make sure that you're identifying that challenge, identifying the opportunity and staying focused on burning down the risk to making that successful, As efficiently as you possibly can. and sometimes that includes technology development. Sometimes it may not. but just making sure that we're, efficiently focusing on solving the problem we set out to solve.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:16:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you certainly did that in Africa. Listen, I've heard a Keller, your CEO and he delivers a really inspirational message. And their problem you guys targeted and how you solve that problem. I wanted to ask given the time you've spent in Africa, Eric, what message would you give to Americans\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:16:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good one. There's just so much, it's so interesting and you have to go experience it yourself, I guess would be my main message. there's so much that's different, but there's so much that's the same, and so it's hard to explain the, that, that spread of where at some, in some ways it's the same problems in the same world and in other ways, it's just so different. I think you can say that about, probably any two, two countries and different communities and, cultures and whatnot. But, but yeah, it's just been such a pleasure to, work with, the partners that we have and the communities that we've been fortunate enough to be able to make an impact in those spaces and in our own way. So yeah, it's just been a really positive. part of my life and my career so far.

Welcome back to The Vertical Space for a deep dive into the medical delivery use case, or I should say another deep dive into this interesting topic. We've had guests in the past notably Justin Steinke from Spright, where we talked about the medical delivery use case from an operator and drone expert perspective. This time we get to hear from Stuart Ginn, who besides having a professional aviation background is also a physician and therefore looks at the drone opportunity through the lens of a healthcare professional, somebody engaged in delivering healthcare and intimately familiar with the complexities associated with it. We've covered a lot of ground in this conversation, starting with a description of the existing internal logistics systems within the large healthcare system. And more importantly, its current problems that drones might successfully address. And we do this in the context of macro factors that healthcare faces in providing access to clinical services, to rural areas. We compare the B2B medical drone delivery business model to that of the B2C consumer delivery and have a lively discussion around which is more likely to become a killer app first. The opinion that the B2B medical drone delivery use case is a promising market opportunity is commonly shared in the industry. However, what is not adequately discussed is exactly how this value will be realized what matters to hospitals and what the ultimate product needs to look like to ensure wide adoption. Here's where Stuart's insights really stand out. For instance, instead of thinking about drones as part of a transportation system,Stuart believes they should be considered as an extension of the infrastructure, not unlike pneumatic tubes in hospitals today. As usual we go deep ask tough questions and uncover interesting insights, not widely shared. Stuart is an ENT head and neck surgeon and innovation leader at WakeMed Health and Hospitals in Raleigh, North Carolina where he also leads system wide innovation efforts as the medical director of WakeMed Innovations. At WakeMed Innovations, he led the inception and implementation of the nation's first drone based medical package delivery system. WakeMed innovations has also developed a novel hospital, integrated health venture model, the WakeMed innovations venture fund, which Stuart leads in partnership with regional venture partners. Stuart is also the co-founder and president of CAHM the coalition for advanced health mobility, a nonprofit working to drive innovation and impact for emerging mobility technologies and human health. Stuart received his medical training at Wake Forest university school of medicine and completed his specialty training in ENT Head and Neck surgery at Stanford university.

I don't think the killer app is necessarily retail and consumer delivery. I think some version of, B2B healthcare related Operation and service may be the killer app, but it's obviously a biased, a heavily biased perspective. when I go to conferences and when I hear other people talk about this, I'm just always looking at this through the lens of an unmet need in healthcare. the second thing is, and I'll just briefly say that this is sort of not related, but obviously there's a lot of concern around Using drones is an example that there's going to be a significant public backlash around, the presence of drones in airspace and in communities. And based on what we've seen, and we'll get into this later, I'm sure, based on what we've seen, in my healthcare system as we use drones, it's just not something we saw. I don't think there's going to be much of a significant backlash. I think we should be mindful of it, but I don't think it's going to be. we're sort of post privacy as a society. And so I think it might not be as big of an issue for companies as others might believe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This will be a very interesting conversation based on opening remarks. So, how about this? let's start framing the conversation, towards the unmet need in healthcare that you just surfaced. tell us why did you and your hospital WakeMed get involved with drones? What is it that is either broken or slowly breaking in healthcare that drone technology is uniquely suited to fix. Give us a bit of a high level context before we start going into more about the current way of moving things in the healthcare system and how drones can then improve that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, so that's a great question. When I started, when I came to WakeMed, we started organizing what we now call WakeMed Innovations, which is sort of a division inside Our healthcare system that looks at innovation capacity and resourcing internally, does a lot of strategic partnerships and thinks about technology, onboarding, all that kind of healthcare related stuff. And when I arrived, they were looking at several large problem sets that The healthcare system is facing in delivering care. We're a growing healthcare system in a really fast growing market, multiple hospitals, multiple freestanding, facilities and physician locations, just a big expanding footprint, and we are a big level one trauma center that is community facing, and takes care of everybody in our region, and our region is blended between urban and semi urban and even rural to a certain extent, but one of the big problems that we were having was our courier network and essentially our internal, logistics and supply chain. they were very unhappy with the level of service and visibility they were getting. They knew they were spending too much money on it. They were wondering, is there a way we can do this better? They were unhappy they had gone through several vendors, third party vendors to try to fix the courier operations and they were just unhappy. So at the time they were considering, bringing it in house and standing up their own operation. that provided sort of a framework for us to start thinking about other ways to provision those services. How do we face our footprint growth and deliver new services and care economically? That's a very tricky set of problems for a healthcare system. But, at the time, and this is 2015 to qualify that in terms of timing, I had a parallel interest in drones and aviation because of my aviation background. And so we started spitballing what it might look like. So theoretically, what does it look like if we provision that service? what if we could connect our facilities through a simple connected drone network? and at the time we knew this wasn't legal or possible, but we also knew that there was progress being made, at least there were hints of progress being made on the regulatory front. So we kind of endeavored to put together a theoretical network. What would this look like, if we, instead of pneumatic tubes inside of our walls, which are ubiquitous for our healthcare system, like many others, connecting, you know, nursing departments and internal to our facilities, connecting people. What if we could do that with drones connecting our other facilities. So we looked at what we're carrying what are the payloads and they were mostly small blood samples, about two thirds of what our couriers were carrying between our facilities were very small, high value packages such as blood samples and small devices, and even inter facility mail. So it was a fit in terms of potential payload. And so we built this theoretical network. what would this look like? And then can we go find partners, who might be willing to model this with us, and who might be willing to, you know, someday in the future when this is possible, provision this with us. And we found Matternet, who I had a relationship with, when I was doing my training in California. And, they were interested in addressing healthcare as a vertical. And so together, we put together this theoretical network. And this was around the time that the IPP, the Integration Pilot Program was being discussed. And eventually when it was published and opened, we had assembled this group of partners, including the North Carolina DOT aviation division and other partners. And so we proposed this network as a pilot site and then were selected and then later UPS joined, as a potential operator. So, essentially, we started with what we've found to be a really sticky, difficult problem for a growing healthcare system. It started in a very theoretical realm, and then we had this opportunity to do it and run a pilot operation for a few years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Stuart, what is it about the existing internal hospital logistics and supply chains that makes\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>the customer so unhappy with? Can you tell us a little bit more about that? that's a great question. so I'm going to qualify this as, it's highly variable. I always say this saying healthcare, sort of big H healthcare, U. S. healthcare implies that all these healthcare systems are the same and they're just not, they're very heterogeneous and, there's a lot of market dynamics, a lot of consolidation and regionalization and mergers with healthcare systems. But the bottom line is that most healthcare systems face a growing demand, if they are in sort of urban areas or areas with fast population growth. they are engaging in lots of consolidation where they're onboarding new facilities and trying to figure out how to integrate operations And if they're in rural areas, they're facing the opposite problem. Hospital and facility closures because of the economics of it, so they're further and further away from their patients, and their patients are having trouble accessing services. So the pressure and the demand for courier services and sort of specialty delivery services to link all these facilities together both near and far is increasing. as sort of a tailwind, the industry is very fragmented, meaning, healthcare couriers and logistics are, as an industry, are highly fragmented. The service levels are traditionally very poor, they are often third parties, and their business models are not very strong, they're probably low margin businesses, and so they can't often provide a very strong value proposition for the healthcare system, and they can't make their customers happy. There's very little visibility for the healthcare system inside that supply chain, that internal supply chain and logistics provision. So we don't know where things are, where they're going. it's hard to pull data because of that, and so... there's limited data into what you're sending where, and so there's a lot of decentralization of control and it's a very catch as catch can as an, as a system and as an operation. reliability is low, costs are high. It's all the things you'd expect. It's a system that's just begging for disruption. and, maybe one dimension that's important here is as healthcare systems are under this increasing pressure, they're also getting serious that for years they could ignore this kind of, you know, logistics and supply chain were just a side function and it was all about delivering care. Over the last 20 years, it's become clear that healthcare systems have to get really good at back of house, functions like supply chain and logistics to stay competitive. So there's an increasing focus on them, but most healthcare systems don't know where to start. Mine, for instance, did not have even a single, there was no division or person whose job was to look at supply chain and logistics internally. They were using a finance guy because he was good with numbers. So, so for all those reasons, the levels of service in the industry are poor, and there's just a lot of fragmentation and high cost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>the description of the pain points that hospitals today are experiencing. if we look into the future and we imagine that, drone technology and operations are pushed forward against this pain point in this use case, what do you see as the ideal solution that drones grow into to address this? And what would the value proposition of the drone system look like at that point?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, yeah, that's a great question. there's so many caveats. Well, I mean, this is probably a pretty sophisticated audience on this pod, who's very familiar with the roadblocks and the hurdles facing drone operations as an example from a regulatory standpoint, but in a future state where the regulatory environment has matured, where distributed beyond line of sight operations are feasible and somewhat scalable, then what is needed is a shift in mindset away from, these are components of our transportation system and provision towards, these are parts of our buildings and infrastructure. where we got traction internally at WakeMed as we were pitching this and populating this idea around was it was very difficult to get folks on board when we were just talking about cannibalizing, courier operations using a drone. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty from a technology and regulatory and safety and social license standpoint around that tech, especially in 2015. But the bigger question was the economics. I mean, does this make any sense? I mean, how much cheaper is it going to be? Is it going to be reliable? But as we started operating the system, even on a very meager, sort of modest scale, connecting two facilities, the questions that started pouring in and the thinking for the organization was Well, when we can expand this becomes a tube system, this becomes a new pneumatic tube system, and it's flexible and nodal and we can push it around to, different facilities, you know, on an as needed basis. So what we want is sort of a distributed network of routes and drone operations that we can use more like an open system and less like a, okay, these are drones that are here to move blood samples. What we need, in its highest form would be an open system that's accessible by lots and lots of people inside the healthcare system which, basically creates an opportunity to connect all those different locations and allows us to then provision new services at these new locations. For instance, there's lots of places we could draw blood samples. for our patients, but, transporting those samples back to our central lab is expensive. and, essentially, we then have to tell the patients, well, instead of us moving your blood sample, we're going to have you move yourself to that facility and have your blood drawn, well this kind of technology obviates the need for that and it moves the things and the goods around instead of the people, when we're talking about drones, I think in its best form, it's an open, accessible network that connects infrastructure and allows for sort of a flexible use over time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in a way you're saying that the demand for using this system is going to come from lots of different parts of the organization and it needs to be really low friction, in order to provision a movement of something from point A to point B, kind of analogous to the pneumatic tube that, anybody can walk up and use it, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's right. I think it's all about access to this system. And obviously when you're planning operations in the early stages, and we'll probably talk about this as, as well, but you need to model your economics and your operation around some Quote, use case. All right. What is it? How do we compare the cost of moving blood samples with a drone versus with a van? Or, you know, there's lots of examples, but the real value is this pent up hidden demand. And what you really want is to provide an open, accessible system and then let the users within the healthcare system help teach you how they're going to use it. and not for nothing, the data that will generate would be substantial and very valuable to our healthcare system. Again, we have very little, sort of perspective, understanding, and visibility for what we're moving where. And that ties very closely to the services we're delivering in those places. And that kind of insight could be incredibly valuable to us. As we try to shape our delivery services and serve our patients in all the different places where they live. It's\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>interesting on the last mile delivery side to consumers, companies are working on a very easy, seamless way to provision a movement. But it's people who are, consumers who have their phone and they're using an app just like they would use DoorDash or the equivalent, to have something, be delivered to them. And they're working to make that very seamless. But what you're talking about in this context is, provisioning a movement that is, you know, come and pick this thing up, or I need to move this sample from where I am to a lab or to a hospital. and... It's a little more heterogeneous, the set of different, movements that people are going to initiate, and really how that use case integrates in with all the different parts of the hospital system. and I wonder, is this going to standardize? Is this going to... become a system that, is copied, across different hospital, groups in very similar form, or will it be different, from, from hospital system to hospital\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>19:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>system? Oh, I said, that's like the million dollar question. I hope there's an opportunity for it to be different Because that means that the companies and innovators who are trying to drive use of this technology in healthcare are delivering, accessible systems and letting the healthcare users define their use in ways that are unique to their needs and communities. I know it's difficult to model a system when you're going to just say out loud, well, our assumption is that we don't know what's going to be used for. I'm not saying it has to be that clean, but I do think it will be different based on the demographics of the system, where they are, how it's configured geographically. Is this a rural spacing system, is it an urban system, is it a hybrid like mine? there's so much heterogeneity inside healthcare delivery, it'll depend on what services they're trying to deliver. I mean, the big picture is, what you want is this to be a set of tools that moves us further down, directionally, aligned towards decoupling services from locations, right? You want to be able to deliver more services in more locations. And by the way, that impacts the economics. I mean, the big picture on the economics for this. Now, this is maybe another thing that others don't agree with me or, I know I'm not alone in this thought, but. The real economics are not going to be driven around operations and cost savings on going head to head with vehicles. I think it's going to be all about, infrastructure costs. you can use tools like this to deliver services to more people in more places without spending an enormous amount of money on infrastructure and physical buildings, or technology having to be co-located in different places, just to provision those services. so those are the real economic drivers for this. Obviously, that's hard to model, and it's the kind of thing that has to develop over time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's interesting, you describe, really there needs to be a period of operational experimentation with, drone deliveries in a medical context, in order to figure out how each use case works most efficiently, or how it works with each of the different hospital systems, based upon their history. And right now, we're in the early stages of that. we're working on, making the movements technically possible, operationally safe and compliant, but figuring out how to integrate them to that use case in the way that really works the best for the stakeholders seems like another chapter and, you know, it just raises questions about, okay, how quickly can this scale, for companies that are going into medical deliveries and making a bet on building a business around that if each hospital system is its own different thing, and if the end customers still have a lot of learning to do on their own in terms of how they want to interact\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>22:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>with it. Yeah, I very much agree. I'm obviously an apologist for this technology in healthcare, but what we've seen at WakeMed and, you know, just as somebody like you who watches this industry very closely is obviously the time, the timelines have not contracted. They have been protracted. And some of that is tied up in regulatory, Constraints and inertia, but we're still on step one. Like you said, we're just trying to figure out how to move these things safely around, facilities and cities and communities. We really haven't had to address the deeper integration pieces that one is community and social license. We have and there's a lot of activity on that front and we're thinking about the environmental impact and the noise impact. That's all great. Some of that's tied up in the regulatory pathway as well, but we really haven't had to face okay well, how do you integrate this, and provide sort of a platform that the end user can direct and use. If it's top down, this is one of the mistakes a lot of people in the industry are making. If you're trying to run it like an airline, okay, we're going to come in, the FAA told us we're an airline, and we are regulated like an airline, so now we're going to operate like an airline, and you just call us when you need us to move something. That is not going to work. so there'll be an another set of steps around integration technology and how do you provide a user interface for these technologies and they will probably like a lot of other advanced mobility technologies need to work in sort of a multimodal integrated system they need to be able to, be able to be integrated into a healthcare systems transportation network seamlessly. and in fact, maybe a significant source of potential for this industry will be that once those problems are solved and there are companies that are addressing integration and interface I think it will probably end up improving the overall transportation mix and multimodality for healthcare systems in general and may move the needle on some of those other adjacent, transportation place.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>can you give us a little bit more insight into the types of movements that currently exist? what types of cargo, what are the distances, what are the endpoints? walk us through that chain of movement for all the goods today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, okay, great question. and I'll qualify this right up front. With one of the problems is, this is... Poorly understood, even among healthcare systems. I mentioned earlier. That there's very poor visibility and often healthcare systems as groups and organizations who are now trying to manage internal or contracted logistics, function, the precision of the data around this is poor and highly variable, in the U. S. at least. So to, to qualify this is we're guessing frankly, now there are healthcare systems that probably have much more insight and increasingly so. For instance, I bet if you get somebody from Kaiser or Intermountain Healthcare, they have a much more sophisticated view of what's being moved around their healthcare system and when. And I'm, I would be willing to bet, in fact, I know that for those large integrated ground up systems, they think very hard and carefully about, logistics provision when they think about new services. All that said... based on the data, for instance, at my hospital system, so we're about a 1. 6 billion per year system, we have about a thousand beds across three hospitals, a level one trauma center, we have four or five freestanding ERs slash multi, imaging facilities, with clinics, and then we have 70 or 80 position practices that we either own or partner with in our community. And that's spread across, Roughly 20 miles in diameter from our central hospital. in our system, what's moving around two thirds of the time is blood samples. A small additional percentage is inter office mail, and rarely large, one off, unpredictable, imaging equipment, and then obviously in the small parcel, piece is pharmacy. So. we don't have a large transportation footprint on pharmacy currently because we're not a pharmacy distributor, but certainly there is a demand for that inside of our system, but I don't have data to support how much of the lift that accounts for. let me use a blood sample as a, as an example. So say a patient is seeing a physician and the physician or NP or PA decides I'm working this patient up and I need a blood test of a certain type. They're typically going to be doing that and delivering that care out in the community in a practice, or increasingly in a retail pharmacy, or in a minute clinic in your Target, or in a physician's office. they may have the ability to draw the blood sample there, but often they do not, and the reason they don't is because there's no point in drawing the blood if they don't have a way to provision transportation of that, sample back, to the laboratory for processing. If it's a integrated practice like the ones I work in a practice owned by my healthcare system. Well, if I need, a sample moved from my office, then there's a courier that's going to pick it up, but they're typically going to pick that up on an optimized schedule, you know, where they stop at my facility a couple of times during the day, or maybe once during the day, if it's really important, I can call for a stat courier and just have a courier drive out and pick it up and ship it back to the lab as a one off. the costs obviously increase as you move up. So you move from highly inefficient to highly expensive across that spectrum. the blood sample either way will eventually make it back to my central lab, which for us is located at our main hospital. It will then get processed, probably in a batch, at some point, and then the result will get entered into the electronic medical record. This process takes, On an outpatient basis, getting the data that the doctor needs from the decision of ordering the lab to getting the data is too long. It is often a day or sometimes more, and it often depends on the patient's ability to travel into a place where they can have their blood drawn. obviously, if we could draw that blood sample reliably on site, because we knew we had a reliable system, a pneumatic tube system, where we could just draw the sample, put it on the drone and send it back to the main campus on demand, and it arrives 10 minutes later, and we can see that device moving through a system. and it's safe and accounted for. all of those things are probably going to be improved with drones. Then the turnaround time on that. A clinical data reaching back to the ordering physician, and therefore a decision being made, will be markedly improved.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stuart, let me ask you a question on that. So you've described then, if I may, I'm at a doctor's office, I had my blood drawn. The blood work is often centralized at the end of the day, and it's brought to a centralized So, you have your hospital system has their own lab, as opposed to, you know, some other, larger national labs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Quest or LabCorp. We do both, but yes, that's correct. We actually do both. Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>and you just described one of the major values of this, I love your pneumatic\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>tube system. I love that analogy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>when you were answering some of Luka's initial questions, you were initially describing a cost advantage. Right. And then you described a data advantage. partly, we don't even know what we don't know as it relates to the samples and where they're going and the like. But when you gave him more specifics, you described a clinical value advantage. Yes. The turnaround time. So which is it? what's the biggest driver here? The cost I'm having a little hard time with, unless you get to rural communities, that the cost of the drone is going to be more effective than the carrier. However, you did say reliability as well, and I know the courier networks, there's almost nothing nationalized, and I'm sure they're very unreliable. But are you saying the principal value is the clinical value of the faster turnaround for the blood test? Because for all intents and purposes, it doesn't seem that the turn time for 90 percent of the blood work is that critical. What's the biggest driver that gets you most passionate about the use of drones for the movement of blood samples?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's a great question. So, obviously as a, maybe the way I'm speaking of this and thinking about it, it's just kind of, Implied, I realize that I take it for granted that at the bottom of this, there's just like, as a doctor trying to deliver care, I want systems that really support that and give me what I need and what my patient needs as quickly as possible. I think it's sort of taken for granted, potentially, for me as an on the ground doc, that The driver for this would be faster turnaround. I'd like to believe that's going to be the driver, for purchasers of these services. And I believe that, actually, from an economic standpoint, it will certainly look a lot different than, for instance, retail, you know, point to point delivery or direct to consumer delivery for retail. meaning the appetite for a healthcare system, the willingness to pay for a system that promotes improved turnaround time and improved care and improved throughput through, for instance, our lab, maybe decreases batching phenomenon, improves turnaround for healthcare. But, you know, for better or for worse, our administrators are operating on our behest. if we want it and we need it faster, they're going to be willing to pay up to a certain point. So I do think that the economics will drive it, like every other purchase decision that gets made in the healthcare system, but the appetite and the willingness to pay for delivering a better experience for the patient and a better quality of care will be significant in the economics of drone delivery in healthcare. I hope I'm not wrong about that. I saw it at my healthcare system when to qualify this answer, I'll say that, you know, we were doing a really relatively high profile innovation project that included this at its core. but we paid for it and we funded that. My healthcare system funded that there was no outside funding for our, provisional drone operation that we did with the IPP. we funded it because we see significant. potential for the future of our operation and our ability to expand, into new areas. I will say that, tied to that clinical turnaround and quote speed, of data sort of return is that idea that we talked about earlier, which is in a world where this technology exists in my healthcare system, they're going to think differently. I've seen them do it. They're going to think differently about what services they can provide where. That opens up service. provision in new locations, and the economics of that are typically positive. So, I do think it's a little nuanced, but I definitely think that the big picture driver will be better care delivery and new services in new locations. So,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stuart, your opening remarks underlined your belief in the killer application being a B2B healthcare, use case. And so as we're having this conversation, I have a couple of question marks bouncing around in my head. So here's the trouble that I'm having in this conversation. It seems like the bar is fairly low in terms of the overall dissatisfaction with existing methods of moving things around in a hospital environment. It also seems like the demand is clearly there. There are structural tailwinds that are supporting new technologies and drones. Yet you're describing a very complex, heterogeneous system in which there is no clear way to, to come up with a solution that can scale. And I can see how the entrepreneurs in our audience might be. You know, weary of, jumping into something that doesn't really have a straight line to scaling. So, at the same time, the airspace integration problem is a lot easier in a B2B environment. You de risk a few routes as opposed to, ad hoc routes of delivering to consumers. Yet, when we look at the reality of the market, the last mile consumer delivery market is, getting to a point of fair level of maturity. And yet, in the medical delivery... Use case, not really have advanced meaningfully past, POCs. So, what's rooted in your belief that B2B medical delivery is the killer app and how do we get to that point, given everything that we've discussed so far?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, well, that's a. That's an impossibly large question. I love that question. No, I think that is the difficult question that's sort of the elephant in the room. So, thinking about this, as somebody looking at, I mean, we spend a lot of time in the healthcare system looking at healthcare technology very broadly. And to qualify this, Look, this is one of the mistakes a lot of people are, are making, is that this is a tool, like using drone delivery as an example, a tool in the emerging advanced mobility stack, this is the classic chicken and egg, just like it is for multimodal transportation systems in cities. If healthcare systems are sort of microcosmic in that sense, then, the value has to be driven by very flexible, multi modal systems with a deep level of integration. how do you... Justify those costs and does that offset the scale required all those issues you just brought up. I will say this, part of this is sort of in terms of why would healthcare, big H, be a potential killer app or a really productive place to experiment and to build business in this industry. Is there for one thing, the definition of health care is changing and it contains B2B, which in the short term helps mitigate some regulatory risk And, you know, because it's predictable networks and, it helps, connect the operations to a public benefit, which could be helpful from a standpoint of when you get down to the local, regional level of governments and citizens trying to justify the presence of this technology in the public domain, I think that B2B healthcare application mitigates some of that, but increasingly healthcare, it means B2C. I mean, I look at what's happening in retail pharmacies where patients are getting healthcare in more and more locations, often at their retail pharmacy. But these retail pharmacies, despite, the Minute Clinics and the CVSs who are investing heavily in healthcare, they still can't manage a patient's full spectrum of disease and healthcare need. Those patients still have to be connected to the integrated healthcare systems in their communities. And this is an example of a technology that can bridge that gap, that connects traditional healthcare models to emerging B2C models, and your pharmaceuticals could be delivered, and blood sample kits could be delivered and retrieved. Lots of potential in the future. but I think it's important to say that out loud, that it's not going to necessarily have to stop in terms of scale at, okay, this is a hospital network, they have five locations, you're going to put drones on those five locations. I think that as regionalization and distributed healthcare. systems emerge, and as new business models emerge in healthcare, the traditional brick and mortar healthcare systems are going to have to learn to partner with those kinds of companies, and you're going to see much more emphasis on pushing this out into the community, and this is a set of tools that can sort of help facilitate that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>okay, I'm still not convinced, I still didn't get the main reason, in your opinion, why we're observing this relative immaturity of medical drone deliveries relative to consumer deliveries. And, you know, perhaps something that you raised earlier, which I thought was very interesting that, maybe is the answer And that is that some people make a mistake of operating the service as an airline, and you say, hey, call us when you need something to be moved. Whereas, you're highlighting the importance of finding the right interfaces and right integration points. Is that the primary challenge needs to be overcome, or is it something else? I don't think it's regulation. I don't think that it's BVLOS. I think, that's becoming an increasingly\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>easier thing to do. So, so that's interesting. I think I agree that the regulatory part of, so maybe then, I know maybe we can unpack that a little bit. So in your view, the regulatory side is not enough of a constraint to explain why healthcare applications have not grown faster. Is that what you mean? Is that what I'm hearing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, I think it's a lot easier for a sophisticated operator to go in front of the FAA or EASA and present safety case for, the combined air and ground risk over\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>a few routes. Right, right. But are we seeing legitimate progress in terms of beyond line of sight operations? So, so can a drone company, any drone company or operator in today's environment approach a healthcare system, say, show me a map of your facilities and I will develop a network connecting all these locations, and that will allow me to develop an operational model, and that will allow me to calculate the economics, and that will allow me to determine how much I need to charge you for this service. I don't think we're there. I don't think the companies in the space are in a position to offer sort of a rational, scaled network, even on a pretty modest scale. so I don't know. I think that there's a component of this where nobody is able to sell the product off the shelf quite yet at least in the United States. Now, I'm much less familiar and up to date on what's going on internationally.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it comes back to, when somebody comes up in front of the healthcare, leadership team, and, pitches something like the drone delivery network, is this currently understood as something that is a nice to have, or is it a must have?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, no, that's a great way to put it. Now, in its current state, it's absolutely not a must have. Part of that, I think, is because, I mean, this is literally why WakeMed, my system, shut down our pilot, because our initial plan was to connect multiple facilities, and we understood that economics of it were... Going to need to be developed with our partners as we went. It was very early. and so they didn't have their model, ironed out. But after three years operating the same route with no prospect of even adding a single beyond line of sight route, in front of us, the internal optics were, well, We're done with the innovation project. This needs to move towards ROI. and the model said, well, until we can add three or four different hospitals, we can't justify this. As a customer, we can't justify its expense. so I think that's constraining things a lot as we have an alternative, right? I mean, couriers exist. it's not a great system. the industry will have to mature to the point where companies can come in and do what I said earlier, offer a relatively. affordable, off the shelf option, to connect multiple facilities and then operate them, and or, and even better, let the healthcare system operate them, in air quotes. so I don't disagree with you. I mean, I think that... Currently, in its current form, and what is available in terms of product and service, it's not a must have. It's a nice to have. how do we get there, was the second part of the question, and gosh, I don't know. I think it's progress on multiple fronts, you know, like death by a thousand cuts. it's slow progress on regulatory, and it's BVLOS. It's, the ability of, operators and drone providers to develop their own productive business models so that they can reasonably charge healthcare systems, something that, that they're willing to pay. but I don't know if there's, I don't have the answer, I don't think, for that, for how do we get, you know, it's a classic chicken or egg, but undeniably additional pilot projects, and each time there's a step forward in operational capability, either regulatory or technology wise, a step needs to get taken by somebody, in some capacity, and the tools need to get increasingly put into the hands of the healthcare users. And customers, or else, will never cross that chasm.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stuart, so, digging in a little bit to the economic question, for operators to come forward with, if we assume that, BVLOS gets done, we step into a scenario where that's there, and where multiple hospitals can be networked together with these routes. from the three years that you were... Operating the pilot. Did you get a feel or, supporting data from that experience that would, tell us what the utilization level of drones in this type of a future network would be? Because the utilization throughout the day is going to be a big driver to the economics and to the cost of it. In consumer operations, we have data from the pilots that have been run that allow us to look ahead and extrapolate. In this case, what do you see? Because on the one hand, lightly utilized drones, Are, going to be expensive on a variable operating basis, obviously, but if the system is heavily utilized, then the system needs to be tolerant to, capacity limitations at a certain point. And I don't know if these movements, can tolerate those types of delays. Or contingencies and failures and things like that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So, great question. Now, our utilization, we connected one freestanding outpatient surgery center slash clinic slash imaging center across a major road, to our hospital, which as the crow flies was a third of a mile so not a long distance, but, every blood sample, we had some exclusions because we didn't want critical samples such as pathology samples where the cost of loss of one would be high just because we were in a sort of a pilot phase, but every blood sample between those two facilities instead of being carried and being batched onto the couriers three times a day was delivered on an hourly and later every half hour basis by our operator, which was UPS. Again, this was configured more like a scheduled airline. It was every half hour or hour during business hours, that drone flew a payload across so our utilization was very high. We were finding that we were able to cover all of the lab samples in a given day that needed to move between those two facilities, with a little bit of additional payload room left, but that's because of the nature of the payload, which was small blood samples, even on a small drone. so I think that the utilization will be high if it's available. And again, the caveat is that this is a scheduled scenario, the real answer to that question is what is utilization when it's not scheduled and it's just available for use when it's a pneumatic tube system. So I don't know that answer\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So at the end of the day, let's say a given day, Stuart, during your trial, you had the hourly service being run by the drone versus the accumulated courier service at the end of the day. so first of all, how did the cost compare, one\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>versus the other? Yeah. So, yes. and to be a little bit more precise. I think the way it was set up that courier stop, I think it was three or four pickups per day, or three pickups per day. versus hourly. the cost data is Artificial. it was an innovation cost. We were paying, um, UPS, or more specifically, Matternet, to operate the, in other words, it wasn't the result of sort of a real operational set of costs. But even, so, my point is, I don't think it was, economically feasible for the operator. They were losing money. For one thing, they had human beings on both sides of the route, and so the automation or autonomy piece was not there, which is probably key to the, to this. So, the cost data is artificial. They were not making money on this contract they were using it to feed their growth as a company and their, funding cycle and all those things. I don't know if I have an honest answer for that. I'll tell you that on a per delivery basis we obviously knew what it cost. for routine deliveries between those two facilities, we were looking at something on the order of$15 per delivery. For stat on demand deliveries, it's like$50 per delivery over that third of a mile and the average, we have data on the average delivery time and with huge variability because of the batching phenomenon the average was still. two to four hours. And with the drone operation, it was ten minutes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>48:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let me jump on that, if I may, just for a minute. you mentioned pathology was removed, because clearly, there can be a time component in pathology, like for a cold section or something like that, where there's enormous time implications. But, most pathology, even if it's... You know, one to two, two to four days, not a lot is going to be done different, whether I get it in a day or four days. I know there's exceptions to that. But even blood work, when you're saying non critical, the, blood work, how much is going to be done different because I get it at ten o'clock rather than I get it at four in the afternoon? what's outcome is going to be different as a result?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, so that's a good question. The belief inside my healthcare system was that yes, batching phenomenon is significant, it's a problem they're trying to solve, and a theoretical system where you could smooth out, and make the cadence of drop offs at the lab more predictable and even across the day would have significant impact into turnaround times And probably the economics and the efficiency of the use of those machines And at least internally it was believed that was addressable with a system like drones putting aside the fact that we didn't understand yet what the cost would be and probably still don't but we knew Where the highest volume of labs were coming in and we knew when, so we, would know how to target that as an intervention. So there is a belief that smoothing out of batching phenomenon will have significant clinical and economic benefits. Again, the thing that our system got most interested in was okay, if we have excess capacity, and to some extent we're always going to have batching, then if we have the ability to send blood samples more fluidly from more locations using something like a drone system that was economically, tolerable, that would improve both the services we could deliver in our community, the locations where we could do it, and then... That could be used to improve the operations of our commercial lab. I mean, that's a revenue generating business for my healthcare system. So the more labs we can put through the system, and the more smoothly and reliably we can do them and the more efficient we can be, the better. Now the hard economics of that are still TBD, obviously, because we've never had to, Negotiate with a drone company around what the cost of this service will be and that's where all the uncertainty is currently\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>if you're going to create kind of the perfect scenario for The type of sample that would be moved whether it be tissue versus blood and let's say the community for which it is for let's say rural versus urban What's the perfect scenario that you would say you would lay out for the use of drone delivery for medical samples?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>right, so The pressing healthcare need. So what I'm hearing is what's the best use case for drones for, and we're still talking about blood samples, or you said any potential use. Right. Okay. Got it. Yeah. So, so that's a great question. I think that, so the most pressing clinical need we face maybe as a country, is access to clinical services for folks in rural locations. And obviously the more distance that's interposed between patients and the services, the higher the cost of movement between them and the higher the cost of provisioning that care and the poorer quality of care because they are less likely to access health care when they need it. so my answer would be, delivering, even basic, preventative services in rural areas. I do think that blood samples are a great way to do that, on the cheap. and so again, I think it's less likely, for instance, we mentioned pathology samples, well that means there's a surgeon operating in that rural location, and that's not going to happen, because Those surgeons are all consolidated back in the central location. But patients being able to access basic preventative and maintenance services like laboratory services. or, sort of reversing that provision of lightweight but important medical supplies such as test kits to more locations in rural communities and the practices that serve them. I think that is the most valuable potential, use case for drones in the U. S. healthcare system as it stands now. all of this is about drones. We're not even touching... Movement of people, which Advanced Air Mobility can touch on, you know, in the future, but in terms of goods and, provision of services, it's obvious that the greatest need is in rural locations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we've addressed this from a few angles already, but, how would you summarize what will it take to succeed as a drone operator serving the healthcare community for the movement of goods?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>for one thing, like you would tell any startup in any space, when you're thinking about the product and service you're trying to deliver, you need to really understand those customers and what they need from you. I think a lot of what it will take is people really digging in and understanding how health care provision works, how chaotic it can be, how the businesses behind them struggle to provision care, including the pieces like logistics. I think these companies and entrepreneurs need to be razor focused. If they're going to go into a niche like health care, they need to be razor focused on those customers. and what they need and what are the jobs that they need done. they don't need more technology. They don't care about more technology. They care about the services they deliver and the patients they're taking care of. So, just deep focus on the healthcare customer will help shape the offering and I think also will be competitively very important for companies that want to engage in the healthcare space. I know that's a common answer, but it's really not something that we're seeing. Again, it's still small as an industry, and the healthcare portion is even smaller. But the interactions we've had with various drone operators and companies are really looking at this. A lot of them are looking at it as a piece of technology and they're shopping around for the best way to use it. and healthcare looked good to some of them early on because... Of the dimensions we've already discussed, the regulatory dimension, the public benefit dimension, all of those things. And I'm glad for their involvement, but in the end it will require deeper focus on the actual customers and what they need.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>you highlighted earlier a mistake that people often approach the problem as if they were an airline. Can you elaborate on this a little bit and perhaps add a few other common mistakes that you see when operators are pitching\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>hospitals? Yeah, so, the top down approach, it touches on what we just discussed and that, and going back to your first question, what's something I disagree about this industry is that, well, one thing is that this is actually an aviation technology. It's not. it's closer to the ground robots than they are to aircraft in my opinion, in terms of how they operate and how they should be approached. But coming in and telling a healthcare system that we have this new fancy technology, call us when you need it is not going to be a productive approach. And ironically, it's because they need it more than you can potentially deliver it right now. they need to move stuff around frequently and unpredictably. So I guess what I'm saying is the approach has to sort of be get on the ground level with the healthcare providers. And when I say that, I mean the healthcare systems and the people designing healthcare services and the people delivering the healthcare services really provide them access to the technology right there at the point of care as deeply integrated and distributed within a healthcare system as you can. there should be like somebody, maybe Luka, you said before, just as little friction as possible between these people, like the nurses and the doctors and these drones, as is possible or feasible. I think that will mitigate a lot of the top down thinking, because it puts the user in the driver's seat. It delivers them access to a sort of more of a platform technology that they can then... I use the way they want to use it and I'm a believer that there will be sort of hidden and pent up and maybe induced demand for the technology based on personal experience and my healthcare system, but it's speculative and not exactly data driven.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so what does the ultimate product look like in your opinion? from a user perspective, should it be the same as walking up to that window in the wall, opening up that pneumatic tube, punching a code to... the pharmacy or whatever, should that be the same kind of interface, except that punch the code for a location that is 20 miles out and then somehow one of those, pneumatic tube branches go off into the drone and it flies away and it's that level\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>of abstraction of all the complexity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What does the product need to look like? And that obviously has implications of how easy it is to integrate and\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>scale, et cetera, et cetera. Yes. So yes, that's a great question. So yes, I would love all those things to happen. we even engaged AEC firms to look at this and they developed plans for us. We looked at putting on, A drone port on a roof of one of our hospitals, and then, finding a way to connect it to the pneumatic tube system directly, that, that's a big lift. That would require some, probably, robotics, and some transfer stations, and things like that. So, while that sounds great, yes, I would like it to be a tube station everywhere that somehow interfaces with the drones, which are now a part of the building. I mean, in its most perfect form, The drone system is like an HVAC system. It's just a part of the building. it's just, it's built into the infrastructure, and it's a little bit more flexible than that because it's accessible, and it's not literally built into the infrastructure, but it's integrated physically into the infrastructure. Now, I do think That is a significant lift, and that has significant impact on the economics, as you mentioned before, and the other trade off is the deeper you integrate into the physical space and building, the less flexible it could become, but the thing that is discounted, and then the final product, I think, will be Something that is populated in the consciousness of the people in the health care system. So even if you have to walk outside, I think people discount the human component. what we need is a system that is relatively accessible to our people on the ground. I should be able to, or our clinical nurses or medical assistants should be able to understand that if they have a lab sample that is given to them, the option now is either batch it with the courier or you have to call a courier stats. They need to understand that a third option is, or I could just walk it downstairs real quick and out in the parking lot, there's a little drone station that I can stick this thing on and then send it across with the user interface that I'm familiar with. that would be a very effective system. It's relatively lightweight in terms of integration. It's accessible, but it requires that final human component. I also think that... that will be critical. it's, in terms of getting the lab sample, the final meter, from the drone, wherever the drone is interfacing with the system, say, analogous to a tube station on a nursing unit, to where it needs to go. It's the people that work in the healthcare system and in the clinics who understand, have all the tacit knowledge, who understand where all this stuff needs to go. If you can just teach them very quickly and easily how they can access the system, I think that's the perfect answer. The perfect way to drive you use it. It doesn't have to be right next to them, but it has to be reasonably accessible and they have to know how to interface with the system. In other words, The user interface has to be very simple.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Stuart, who are the groups that are the most natural fit for figuring this out, figuring out how to integrate this technology into this type of an operational use case? Is it the hospital system itself that does this evaluation and integration and adoption? Or, I don't imagine that many of the drone operators are going to, take it all on themselves. Perhaps, one or two of the pioneers would, but is there a segment, that sits in the middle where there's a natural fit, where there are companies that do this as part of their business, or is this something that needs\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>to be filled?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a great question. So, healthcare systems as customers are notorious for having a hard time figuring out if they want to build or buy across multiple products and domains. I mean, virtual care services are a great example as they're trying to figure out how to deliver virtual care to patients. Some are buying off the shelf, and that's driving a new corner of the industry. And some are saying, you know, it makes more sense if we just build this ourself and do tech partnerships and sort of assemble versus build. I don't know, which will occur here. I do think the way that healthcare systems buy products and services, it will certainly be easier if that interface and integration is done with them, but through the delivery of technology, meaning I do think there is going to be space for companies whose job it is to come in and say, we're going to optimize your logistics and your transportation networks through this technology, and we're going to add drones as a component of that. I do think, from an economic standpoint, they will probably need to address more than just, we're going to add drones to your system. The hope is that Those companies in the middle may help optimize against the growing demand for provision of logistics and transportation services that I mentioned early on in this discussion. And so there may be ways they can provide a broader value proposition around transportation and logistics that includes drones as a component, but isn't only aimed at drones, if that makes sense. Another way to put that is drones alone are... attractive and valuable for all the reasons we've discussed, in my belief, for healthcare systems. But all the better if we're optimizing for a larger transportation and logistics need that is poorly provisioned currently. So I do think there may be space for that, to emerge, sort of integration platform providers that focus on things like B2B healthcare systems, to what extent that will be integrated into sort of what, you know, maybe there will be like you mentioned some drone companies or operators who decide that level of technology and service is necessary to satisfy their customers. it seems as likely that happens as it is that a third set of companies will come in and optimize for it. but, but I don't know. I do think that interface needs to exist.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm guessing there are rural healthcare systems that have a considerable cost of couriers and they are not reliable where they would say there's a great value once drones are at scale of plummeting my delivery costs and keeping my labs consistently busy, as you mentioned, that's one of the values that the lab would be busy throughout the day. I'm assuming that lowers costs as opposed to, I'm not quite sure why they just can't wait for the next day and evenly distributed throughout the day. But at the end of the day, my guess is there will be major rural health care systems that would say I may be able to reduce two to four percent of my costs with a reliable, less expensive drone delivery service. My guess is that's probably the low hanging fruit, Stuart. But I'm not sure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, I agree with you on that. and for instance, like you mentioned, why do they not mitigate their batching phenomenon? Well, those labs run 24 hours a day. The reason they don't do that is because there's another batch coming in. Like they just have not been able to, effectively do that. But I agree with you. I think that is the low hanging fruit. and it's a good place to start. It's also addressable from a standpoint of, modeling. I mean, maybe one of the issues here is, and you folks probably have a much better idea about the, what is emerging in the economics of drone operation and delivery, more broadly. But these companies don't know how much to charge, and they don't know how to price their service. They don't even know what their costs will be at scale, necessarily. they've never had to do that. It's just still very early is maybe the takeaway. I think that everybody's struggling to figure out exactly how the economics, like sort of a unit of economics will work for this kind of a delivery network based on this technology.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One thing that was mentioned by, one of our guests once was the potential of organ movement via drone, and I know weight is a big issue right now, but is there any sense of if only this could be moved by drone It would make a huge difference whether it be cost or a clinical\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a great question. I have an answer, that I have an opinion. it's people. And I want to qualify the use of the term drone. Drone, as we're discussing it now, probably implicitly means small fully automated vehicle that can carry small packages, 10 to 50 miles, but advanced air mobility. I think the tipping point is people. You can move expertise and you can move patients and they can carry cargo. But the transportation footprint for human beings, even on a non emergent basis, for healthcare system is much, much larger than most people think. As an example, my mid sized healthcare system, as already discussed, manages about over 20, 000 patient transfers per year. It's almost all regional within 50 miles. And the vast majority of that is not emergency or critical care. It is just inter facility transport of people. that is a large transportation footprint. and it's expensive and it's highly inefficient. and I think when we get to the point where we're able to move, if we're able to move people, so, so if drones or pneumatic tube systems and let's say eVTOLs are elevators, If we're able to do that, it doesn't have to be automated even, it can be piloted, but if we're able to do that and move people back and forth between, rural areas and, and health care facilities, for instance, then I think there's a giant impact on the way health care systems are configured. As an example, the entire trauma system in this country It's implicit in the way that trauma systems work is transportation provision, helicopters and ambulances, but it's not efficient, and it's very expensive. And essentially, we're willing to make those cost tradeoffs in their current form, because human lives are at stake but even for the more routine aspects of healthcare, I think when you can move people sized cargos or people themselves, that's a tipping point. Organs are great, but they're very specialized. It could be a very nice, addressable target for a company. but we're talking about... a very specialized group of hospitals, and in, in terms of scale and impact on health care, it's a tiny piece of health care, is organ transplant. So while I think it's very attractive to think about it, They'd help improve clinical care, changing outcomes for organ transplantation, which is by the way, all that any healthcare system cares about. They don't care if it's a drone. They would like to be able to provide the best transplant service they can. That requires large teams of surgeons to be moving around. That requires lots of infrastructure on the ground, clinical care, co operative and post operative services. The idea that you would move the needle clinically with a drone on that because you could move the organ faster is laughable to me. And I think that anybody who's seriously engaged on the ground with healthcare understands the complexity of that kind of work. And so it could be a very great way to generate, sort of pilot opportunities and have a lot of exposure. And yes, it would improve care, but is it going to move the needle on healthcare outcomes in the world of transplant? That's harder to imagine. So I think it needs to be aimed at less critical functions and more routine kinds of service where distance, is a factor, and where infrastructure is lacking. I think that's the great promise of this technology very broadly, drones, eVTOLs, all of it, is that it represents a new layer of configurable, flexible infrastructure that could be used to design and deliver services.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stuart, anything else that you'd like to, perhaps mention or summarize the conversation with?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Stuart:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't think so.
