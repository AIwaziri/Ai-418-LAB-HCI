And if the goal as I see it, is that we end up more or less integrating UTM and current air traffic control then we need to accomplish a number of steps, which are going to be quite difficult.

Andrew talks about what major steps must be taken with UAS traffic management and U-Space, and that radical steps have to be taken to integrate the airspace. And if we're going to get the high density operations we need an airspace where all aircraft are going to fly together. And if we don't do it, UAS is unlikely to be economically viable. He extensively discusses U-Space. How it started. Where it stands today, the requirements for setting up U-Space, why it's taken so long to implement and how it'll evolve in the future. Something really revealing about Andrew, in my opinion, is his comment early in our discussion, as he says, we wanted to see from the beginning where we wanted to get to in the end. Where in other parts of the world, UTM is being deployed in a slow iterative process, perhaps the most convenient steps, but not the best steps. Andrew wants to design the system from the beginning and the way he envisions it, looking in the end. And that the expedient and the convenient, we'll never get to where we want to eventually be. That was a really good discussion. Another good section is on drone detection. He refers to the categories of the careless, the clueless and the criminal, and how detection has to account for each. He discusses radar acoustic optical radio-based systems and others, and the challenges of detecting noncooperative aircraft. He mentioned that detect and avoid is not a focus of U-Space today. And how U-Space plans do safely separate vehicles. And to that end, we have a great discussion around tactical and strategic deconfliction. He explains that so much as strategic today because he believes they currently don't have any confidence in this surveillance. And then in order to do tactical maneuvers, you need to know where the aircraft are. Listen how Andrew believes manned and unmanned aircraft will be managed in the same traffic management system. And what will become an automatic traffic management system. Yes I agree with Andrew this is certainly where people tend to get a bit anxious, including some who've been on our podcast. We admire his bold albeit controversial approach to the future of traffic management. He talks a lot about commercial organizations or service providers who are providing or plan to provide traffic management functions. Who they are and where they're based and their commercial and business opportunities. He discusses that these are very tough times to be in the service provider business. Because there's not enough flying yet. He says we suffered from a bootstrap problem in this domain that until there's traffic management there won't be flying and until there's flying, there won't be traffic management. So somebody has to get it started and these companies are all hoping it starts soon. It was an absolute delight to speak with Andrew. He's so informed, he's been doing this for a long time, he's extraordinarily articulate and he has a realistic, balanced, yet optimistic view of how UAS and UTM operations will come together and has some clear areas where UAS operations have real and unique value today. Andrew, thanks for joining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our conversation with Andrew Hatley as you innovate and The Vertical Space.

Andrew Hately, welcome to The Vertical Space. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you very much. I'm very happy to be here.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First question, is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, there, there is. I am from a research background, and I have been looking at this, UTM, U-Space stuff, and I've been thinking from the beginning, where do we want to go eventually? And I see that there are some radical steps that we need to take. And I have had some disagreements with some people, even some quite notable people on Is it worth taking these steps? Are these steps going to be too costly or too difficult? But I would say that if we are going to get to high density of operations, we're going to get to, electric vehicles carrying passengers, then we need to have, an airspace where all of the aircraft can fly together. And that's going to take a revision of flight rules, which might influence the airspace categorization classes, and I think these steps are a bit scary for some people. Some people look at the current situation and say, how do we get there? So, there are a few people in the industry who disagree with me on taking radical steps, and are these steps justified? But I would say if you look at the alternative, we will just never get to the situation where UAS are economically viable if we don't take these steps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is the disagreement due to the fact that people don't necessarily see the additional value prop or is the disagreement in terms of the complexity, both technical and organizational, to pull something like that off?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the disagreement is mostly about how do we make the step. For example, would it involve retraining people or would it involve modifying aircraft and things like that? And there's always this resistance because the initial impact will be so large. And so that, that's why people tend to disagree with me, but I would always argue that not doing this, the impact will be even larger. So at a certain point we have to grasp the nettle and take a difficult decision. So. I know I recently had a disagreement with Maria from EASA about whether or not we could have a UTM system, a U space system, ultimately controlling manned aircraft. And she felt that was perhaps going to be such a difficult step that there wouldn't be support for it in the industry and so on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Maybe it's important to highlight the difference in the definitions between the U. S. and, Europe. Because I'm guessing in the context that you're referring to, UTM is, increasing automation in managing air traffic, as opposed to traffic management of unmanned aerial systems. Is that correct?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So when we started, the term UTM was being used as a general term. Now, the specific implementation in America has quite a defined scope and is a lot less general than the way that we were using the term in the research community. The European version, USPACE, we started to look at that from a research point of view as being ultimately something that would go on to control these eVTOLs and similar things like that. UTM as it has been implemented in the USA is very much about supporting current operations, supporting VLOS flights, and allowing VLOS flights to occur in an airspace where there are possibly VFR flights going on and things like that. I will tend to use the term UTM more in the general sense, meaning any traffic management of unmanned aerial systems. And typically we are looking at this being completely unmanned traffic management or, as unmanned as we can make it, there will always be a need for escalation to a human for obscure corner cases. We've seen this in many forms of automation, but the general operation we expect will be automatic and it will be providing a service. Because it's automatic, it'll be providing a service which is scalable to a very large amount of traffic, and it'll be providing that service very cheaply. So the scope of USPACE is much broader than the current term UTM is used in the U. S., which is really focusing on the current operations of VLOS flights in the most part. I would imagine as, this part 108, is published for consultation in the summer. it may be that the term UTM begins to take on a broader meaning in the USA. Because I think part 108 will push the envelope a bit and push it towards some of the decisions which have already been made in Europe. do you want me to contrast the USPACE and UTM? Would that be helpful?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Great.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So in, in Europe, USPACE is something which is proposed by the regulator and the USPACE service provider has certain obligations towards the regulator. In the USA, the UTM system, all of the responsibility rests with the aircraft operator and the UTM service provider is a subcontractor of the aircraft operator, but all of the liability still rests with the aircraft operator at all times. So the aircraft operator is seeking support, but that's all he gets from the UTM service provider. Whereas in USPACE, the USPACE service provider is something a little bit like an air navigation service provider in that they have their own responsibilities and they are meeting these towards the regulator rather than only towards the aircraft operator.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, if you could, I think there's subtleties to how people disagree with you. Explain a little bit more about, why you are not at the same sheet. So for example, so many people may say there's going to be an iterative approach to UTM or to U space where you may be feeling, I want to go further faster. Others may be also saying, and I'm now I'm cheating a little bit because we talked a little bit about this in advance, you see the ATC piece being integrated much faster into UTM than others would say, and that's clearly getting into a controversial area. So could you dispel it a little bit more?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it comes from, how we started. the group I was working in started looking at, UTM and USPACE. We wanted to see from the beginning where we wanted to get to at the end. Although it will be an iterative process, we didn't want it to be a process in which each step was going to be the most convenient step to take right now, without a view of where the path would lead. And we wanted to see clearly what's the goal, and then work back how do we get there. And if the goal as I see it, is that we end up more or less integrating UTM and current air traffic control then we need to accomplish a number of steps, which are going to be quite difficult. And so I have the tendency to draw attention to these difficult steps right now, when people say we might do these later, or hopefully maybe do these never because they're difficult. And I, I feel if we take that approach. We will have never reached the goal and the benefit that we really would like. So I tend to argue against the expedient and the convenient. And I'm pushing towards difficult steps and for some of these, so for some of my colleagues, these steps really are tough. If we want to qualify, an automatic system as being an ANSP, then we need to learn a lot about how we qualify these systems, what the expectations are. Today, if you look at, an Air Navigation Service Provider, we certify these with reference to the responsibilities of people, with reference to the responsibilities of management, and it's much harder to take that and say, well, how could we implement all of this stuff as software? What's the algorithmic basis on which you could provide these services without a human there? And it, I think there's a lot of worries in the minds of people who have to actually practically do this, which Perhaps they're not pressing on me so hard as I'm in the research domain. it's much easier for me to be a visionary because, well, I won't be alone in trying to implement this for one thing,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you're also advocating, listening carefully. There are people who are beating up their phones right now, I think, listening to what you just said. So you're also advocating some form of automated air traffic control here, which would have less human involvement. So I would assume this is another controversial part of what you're saying, but you may not be saying that, so please explain in more detail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that's where we get to, but it doesn't start like that. So it starts with, we want to fly UAS in the lower airspace. And we would like to do this as cheaply as possible. So we would like to provide, traffic management services mostly on the basis of software. Probably with a human supervisor for these unusual corner cases for escalation in case of an emergency. But for the general running, Software based. Once we have a software based traffic management system, we have the question about what do we do when a manned aircraft wanders in there for whatever reason. If it's a manned aircraft which is expected, for example some helicopter emergency medical service flight, or a manned aircraft which is unexpected, some light aircraft which has had an engine failure, how do we deal with that? And the current approach which What is proposed is to deal with this as an exception, and we will have the UAS move out of the way and the manned aircraft will be treated as an emergency case. But in the longer term, if we're going to do this in a scalable manner, that manned aircraft has to be treated as a routine process. So eventually, we would like the manned aircraft to participate in the traffic management system, which is providing a service for the UAS. So the, I would like that the manned aircraft is filing a plan, and then is being given an authorization, and then is being monitored that it's following its plan. And once we start to do that, we see that we have a system which can be scaled upwards. These, electrically powered, taxi flights, these eVTOLs, passenger carrying operations, which many operators would like to do without a pilot on board, will probably be managed by a similar, UAS traffic management system. In Europe, we expect USPACE to manage these, but they'll be flying a bit higher than the bottom level, 500 feet. They'll be flying up to a few thousand feet. So now we have a situation where this is an airspace where manned aircraft might fly more than just in case of emergency. And again, I would propose that the logical way to do this in a scalable manner would be to integrate the manned and the unmanned aircraft so that they're controlled by the same system, and so that they are able to interact in a safe but integrated way, and that requires that we have an automatic system which is now giving instructions to manned aircraft, not as an exception, and then we need a qualified automatic system, which is capable of safety of life operations and is good enough to do this. I think that's where people begin to get a bit anxious and begin to disagree with me. I want to go too fast. I'm not sure if I do want to go too fast, but I have a clear view of where I want to get to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Andrew, if this is what success looks like ultimately with UTM, can you go in a bit more detail to describe the milestones that will lead to this success? Both on the, technical side, implementation, cultural, organizational. what are all the stakeholders who have a say in this progression?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, so there's quite a few people involved there. So, The first is that we need to be confident that we can do it. So we need the industry, which is producing the systems, to be able to demonstrate that these systems are good enough and have a high enough quality and a high enough, availability and resilience that they are capable of being trusted to do this. The second step is we need to understand how it will be done. And one of the key problems here, which I would like to spend more time working on, is the flight rule. We do not today fly small UAS following either visual flight rules or instrument flight rules. And if you look at the way that ICAO describes airspace classes, they're all described in terms of these two flight rules. So what we need to do is identify a flight rule for the small UAS, and then understand how it can safely interoperate with the existing ones or the existing manned traffic. One option would be that there's a new flight rule that all of the traffic follows, both manned and unmanned. Another option is that we would find a third flight rule which is compatible with the other two in some way. If you look at the descriptions of how, flights are supposed to occur, it is possible to mix visual flight rules and instrument flight rules today. If we had a third flight rule, perhaps we could find a way to mix that. So, we need to understand the operational basis on which the traffic is mixed together. We need to understand the technical basis on which it's done. What are the procedures? Are the systems capable of providing them? We need to convince the regulator that this is going to be safe enough. It should meet the target level of safety. and we need to convince the existing aviation community this approach is going to be acceptable to them. That they are going to certainly not be inconvenienced and hopefully will benefit from this approach. And we're a little bit optimistic on this basis because, studies have shown that current visual flight rules are not really as safe as people believe they might be, and particularly, tests about visual acquisition of the target show that it's quite common that a pilot of a VFR flight doesn't see everything that they, should. So we are hoping that by providing some support, which is being originated to allow, remotely operated aircraft to fly, that we can enhance the experience of pilot onboard aircraft and that way we can get acceptance for these kinds of what would otherwise be really fairly radical changes to the way that the airspace is structured.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the primary benefit of increasing automation in the air traffic management function? Is there mostly a safety argument? Would you say that this is the primary problem that the industry is facing, or is it more about productivity, being able to accommodate greater traffic density, because part of it, and I'd love your thoughts on it as well, the way traffic management is done in Europe is not the same, obviously, as it's done in the U S organizationally, but at the same time, it feels like there is more inefficiencies and please correct me if I'm wrong in Europe because of the fragmented market, and every nation wanting to have that function internally, as opposed to perhaps sharing it among multiple countries. A couple of questions in there, and I know there's a lot to unpack there, but, what comes to mind?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So there, there are several points there, which I'll need to unpack. Yes. The European air traffic management system is quite fragmented and complicated because air traffic management is the, responsibility of sovereign nations. And in the European Union, we have 27. In, in Eurocontrol, we have 41 member states. So each of these is able to operate its airspace as it wishes, but we work together, and you probably know that Europe has a single integrated traffic management system operated by Eurocontrol, the network manager, and we in the network manager, we ensure that each air traffic control center, well, ensure, we aim that each air traffic control center does not suffer from more traffic than it's able to manage. So there is a process, a rolling process every day where the air traffic control centers look at what kinds of effects might influence their ability to manage traffic, weather effects. I mean, weather is a dominant phenomenon in American air traffic management. it's more prevalent here only in the height of summer and winter. But still weather takes a role. You also have, more subtle effects like important football matches or other things like that which cause, increases in the flow of traffic. All of this is discussed every day in a rolling program and then in the network management system we implement delayed takeoff to avoid that there is, too much traffic in the air, more traffic than can be safely managed. So this goes back to the start of the question where you said, is this a, an issue of safety or is it an issue of capacity? Safety is never compromised, but the result is that when we hit a hard capacity limit, the demand cannot be accommodated at the time it would like to be. So, in Europe, we have these take off slots, which are issued for traffic management reasons, and that is quite evident. In the summer months in Europe, quite a number of sectors of the European sky are at the limit. The traffic cannot be increased without quite some evolution in how we manage the traffic. Certainly among the most busy airspaces in Europe is the region above Belgium, which is a crossing point for traffic coming off the Atlantic Ocean, heading to various European airports, and also traffic flying from Scandinavia towards Spain, and so it's a bit of a crossroads there. And in, in the Belgian sectors, the, Maastricht Air, Upper Air Traffic Control Center really is often pushing towards what it can deal with. And the result, unfortunately, is that the aircraft takeoffs have to be delayed. So, continuously in, in European ATM research, we're looking at how can we improve the capacity without compromising the safety. Many of these kinds of questions can be addressed by some of the techniques that we're looking at to use for UAS traffic management. One of the kind of the most basic principles is we've divided the air traffic management world into sectors. Each sector has normally a pair of air traffic controllers, one of them is talking on the radio to the aircraft, he's the executive, the other air traffic controller is coordinating with other sectors, and the limit to how much work they can do is the mental capacity of these two Air Traffic Controllers to think about the number of aircraft in their sector. For a sector where the traffic mostly fly in straight lines, that capacity can be very high. For a sector where the traffic have to be steered towards an airport or something like that, the capacity is much lower. But it's a mental limit. If the system is completely automated, a computer has no mental limit. We can just buy a faster and faster processor or scale it among multiple computers. So the limits become other than mental capacity. And that way we can, develop techniques in UAS traffic management, which will be re applicable in manned traffic management and promise to increase capacity and possibly reduce costs also. And those aims I think will be in the interest of all airspace users, all air traffic is looking for these kinds of benefits. So there's a great deal of interest from the air traffic management world in what we're doing in the UAS traffic management. But also, as a primary job, we would like to enable UAS traffic. The European Commission and the European, Parliament have identified that operation of small UAS will provide economic stimulus. There will be jobs resulting from these kinds of activities. So they're keen for this to happen as an end in itself. But the benefit that we can accrue from that, we can also apply to air traffic in general.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>27:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Andrew, in that vision that you lay out for the transition to automated handling of, that air traffic, is there agreement on the roadmap for how that information would be communicated to the aircraft themselves and how we move from where we are today to have a different way of communicating that information that its own pipeline is much, much higher capacity than voice over VHF that we have today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, we're at the beginning of this. So, we have a vision of this today. We are not even close to implementation. So the roadmap to get there will start by, let's understand the problem and solve it for the small UAS. And that's going to take us several years. it'll be 2050 or later, before we're beginning to apply this stuff to all upper air traffic. So in, In beginning to attempt to answer these questions, yes, we are looking at what's called, Controller Pilot Data Link, CPDLC, which is being used today in Europe for what you might call low priority communication between the air traffic controller and the pilot. So effectively, they're sending text messages to each other. The use of this I anticipate will increase, and in order to increase, it will require that we have low latency communications. When CPDLC started, there was a lot of worry about the latency, the messages might take a long time. But as we get used to using them, then yes, this could be a way forward. This could be a way to allow further automation of the air traffic control system and then conveying the, information to the aircraft in a more speedy and timely manner.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are people also looking at what that workflow looks like for pilots and controllers where you might have mixed usage of voice over VHF and then the rollout of a data based link and how do people who are in flow, who are, working the traffic, how do they bridge across both of those modalities?

I've been involved in, simulation to do with researching this at least nearly 20 years ago, and the early use of CPDLC has been, well over 15 years. It is an ongoing activity and it's also used in the US and elsewhere. The crucial step is to trust it to be speedy enough to use for the kind of separation clearances. Today we're using it for the, lower speed stuff, the, uh, change the radio frequency and contact the other sector type instructions. But, for data link to be, the only means of communication, we need to get a bit more confidence about how well it works and how speedily it works.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, let's talk a little bit about Air Risk Mitigation. Let's bring it back to drone air traffic management. How is EASA approaching Air Risk Mitigation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, today the U space regulations describe a thing called a U space airspace. So the state will declare a U-Space airspace, and that's where these services will be provided and where there will be used. So this process of declaring a U-Space airspace, it's a kind of little reserved area which is dedicated towards flying, UAS BVLOS flights, and so the state has to, or the competent authority as it's called, it's often the Civil Aviation Authority or the National Safety Agency, but it's an agency which is interested in air traffic, will have to look at the region where they want to create this thing, and they will have to create what they call a concept of operation, what they expect the UAS to do, how they expect them to fly, the processes they want to follow, the expected performance, what is the, navigation performance they expect from the aircraft, what speeds are expected, what's the latency that they expect. So once they have this concept of operations and they have to make a kind of estimate of the traffic, they will then do this airspace, risk assessment in which they will balance all of these factors and they will come up with a, A description of how this USPACE airspace can be operated safely or meeting the target level of safety which has been put forward for the area. So that is in the bubble of the USPACE airspace. So EASA today is segregating the UAS into these little regions. For a flight outside these regions, EASA has described an open category of flight, which is visual line of sight, which is done, in a manner where basically the UAS has to get out of the way when something is coming. And the other option is certified operations, which at the moment, there's not really much said by EASA. That would be something that would need to be worked out between the aircraft operator and the Civil Aviation Authority, probably with some kind of specific agreement about how it would be done. Maybe with a danger area created or, temporarily segregated area created for the flight to occur. So these are the, three means of operating today. And this is how, air risk is being handled. In the U-Space regulation, you find two other aspects which relate to air risk. There's this idea of dynamic airspace reconfiguration, and in this process, if necessary, U Space airspace will be temporarily closed to allow a manned aircraft to pass. And this is considered to be done when the airspace was previously controlled airspace, and this process would allow it to revert to being controlled airspace. So, air traffic control could decide to close the used space to allow an aircraft to fly through safely. The third method, is this electronic conspicuity where a manned aircraft could enter the U space airspace so long as it was visible to U space. And this is, in my personal opinion, the least well described. I could imagine this working as an exceptional process, but I'm not so happy with it being a regular thing, because effectively the manned aircraft comes along and all of the U-Space traffic has to get out of the way, and in doing so may encounter their own problems. So, this is the current approach to air risk. It has to be said that the current European, regulations anticipate quite low density of traffic, and we would be looking forward to a revision of the regulations, as the density of traffic is rising, and we start to see a need for more subtle, air traffic management for the UAS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can we be a bit more specific and maybe run through a scenario of a drone operator who wants to fly a commercial drone delivery service or any commercial drone beyond visual line of sight in a, suburban slash rural area. And let's put the ground risk aside and just focus on the air risk. The challenge that exists today, and again, correct me if I'm wrong, but if one looks at the SORA air risk matrix, essentially any time that you're flying below 500 feet above ground, unless you are flying in uncontrolled airspace over rural areas, you pretty much immediately fall in, in the Air Risk Charlie class, which automatically classifies the operation as SAIL 4. The problem, though, is there's no tactical, TMPRs the tactical mitigations for the residual air risk that are approved for, medium and high integrity levels. So the challenge for these drone operators becomes; how can we somehow reduce the air risk class by either flying in U space, which is automatically class Bravo, or I shouldn't be using class Bravo because that confuses with traditional airspace, but ARC B, or they go and run an analysis of the actual air traffic, and show that the risk of encountering, manned traffic is actually lower than what the original SORA matrix would suggest, and therefore they get that class reduction. So talk about this challenge that operators today face. What are the levers that they usually pull on? Is this description correct?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Your description is perfect, and I'm very impressed with your knowledge of the domain. Yes, this is exactly what's going on. And if you look at, and I must say it's not something I'm particularly expert on, but if you look at the operations today, which are occurring, you have Manna operating in Ireland. You have Wing operating in Finland, you have soon Amazon operating Italy. They are typically having to deal with the fact that there's not yet uSpace available, but uSpace is coming soon. And as you correctly described, one of the things that they have to do is they have to make an argument about is the air risk acceptable? Is the risk of manned traffic coming by low enough? And typically that can be mitigated by asking for a restriction. and in Finland, you find, occasional restrictions are placed with the word Wing in the title, so you know who's operating there, but, either a restriction or, as you say, an analysis of the traffic, but that analysis, which you're talking about is the first small iteration towards this air risk assessment. Air risk assessment is a more thorough and long term version of this analysis. And so setting up a U-Space airspace is a logical extension of the process that, an exceptional operation would need to go through. So today, these operations are not in U-Space airspace, but the hope is that very soon they will be, we're expecting 2024 to see the first U-Space airspace is declared and it clearly makes sense to put them where people are currently wanting to fly. So, I would hope to see their emergence, in and around some of these areas where these operations are occurring.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:28\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the requirements for setting up U-Space? Is there a threshold in terms of the traffic density that an area needs to have in order to warrant U-Space implementation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, there's nothing like that. It's a a choice to be made by the competent authority in each state. So we may see, U-Space airspaces which are set up in result of a demand from an Aircraft operator. We may see them being set up as a result of a demand from a service provider. We have seen a lot of interest in flying in harbors, for example, and there the harbor operator might be the one who would be, pushing for, a U-Space airspace to, to be declared. Or we might see states who want to set up U-Space airspaces because they have an expectation that once one exists that flying will begin. It's hard to predict at the moment because we're in a special period at the moment. Everybody is feeling their way and learning how to do this. I think once we have one or two U-Space airspaces declared, I think we will, then gain more experience about how to create them, more experience about how they can be used, and we'll see a period of fine tuning, but also a period when more and more are created as the states master the process and are more confident about declaring these things. And it must be said that there is quite a lot of work to do in the airspace risk assessment, because at a certain point there needs to be a link made between, for example, separation and the performance of the various systems, the performance of the aircraft, the performance of the traffic management system, the performance of the surveillance as it is. So, this is why the states are going quite slowly at the moment, but I think once it's been done a few times, I think the states will gain confidence, and it will become something which is done more readily. And then I would see in Europe that it would be, not unreasonable that a request from an aircraft operator, certainly if it's going to be more than just a few flights, might result in the work being done to, to set up a U-Space airspace.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Talk more, Andrew, about why it's taken so long to implement U-Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's really been a learning process. The U-Space regulation was published, in 2021, and then it took us quite a long time to develop the acceptable means of compliance. And I would say this initial acceptable means of compliance will probably be amended as we learn more. But it still has a number of gaps. There's still quite a lot to learn about, what standards to apply, how to make the implementation, how to certify the service providers. What the, Airspace Risk Assessment comes out at. What is the minimum required performance for the aircraft in order to achieve a separation which is fine enough to make the U-Space airspace have a capacity that makes it worth operating? We can achieve safety by restricting the flights a great deal, but that's not the aim of U-Space U-Space should allow BVLOS flight to be approved relatively quickly and often that the expectation is that the aircraft operator will put in a plan and generally that plan will be approved. We are hoping to avoid that, that planning results in rejection and conflict detection as a, a frequent occurrence. It should be a rare occurrence. We're hoping to promote the use of the UAS by, creating these U-Space airspaces. So the, airspace risk assessment should hopefully, produce a separation requirement which allows a reasonable capacity. And the state, or the competent authority which is making the airspace risk assessment needs to be convinced that the performance of the aircraft, the navigation performance, its ability to fly, the surveillance system, the satellite navigation and so on. All produce a situation where this separation can be achieved and produce a convincing story that it can be achieved repeatedly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, where and when do you see U-Space being deployed in Europe in what countries and why?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have a reasonable expectation that we'll see something in 2024, probably Spain, Switzerland, and I'm hoping in Antwerp, there's a project called BIRDI, a European funded research project, which is trying to create, U-Space airspace over Antwerp harbour and I think they have a good chance. They, have a lot of resources and they're working hard towards this. But at the same time, there's a kind of unofficial race going on. I think Zurich are doing well and, I think we'll see one in Spain certainly in 2024, if at all possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Drone Detection, how are they handling it in the U-Space? What are the different ways they're addressing it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So drone detection has not been considered part of U-Space so far. And this is perhaps, it's worth noting that, security matters are the domain of the state. And, EASA, European Aviation Safety Authority, tends not to, get too much involved in saying things about what states should do. So, the U-Space regulation doesn't talk about drone detection, but we have a lot of interest in drone detection in Europe, and we're seeing quite a lot of activity, often driven by, state security organizations, often relating to airports, but other areas as well. And, the drone detection really is aiming at three different groups, referred to as the careless, the clueless and the criminal. And for the careless and the clueless, we can do quite a lot because we may require fit of equipment to the aircraft, which makes them detectable. The criminal are the third group and we're in an arms race with them. It's always going to be, what can we do and what can they avoid us doing? So, I think progress is being made in this field. Initially there was a lot of interest in primary radar, but that's very difficult. The aircraft presents a very small target for radar. The reflection is quite weak. The, small UAS move around at similar speeds to cars in some cases, or to birds. So it's easy to get, false positives from other things. So it's a difficult radar target, but there are methods that can be used. Other techniques which can be used include listening out for the command and control link radio signals. But again, in the case that somebody really doesn't want their drone to be observed, they can find ways around this. There has been some interesting work about drone detection in terms of one aircraft detecting another based on listening. There was a project called PercEvite, which was working on a hear and avoid, mechanism. And, that looked quite promising. And there's been a number of projects have been looking at see and avoid based on cameras and image recognition, sometimes stereoscopic, sometimes, with a single camera, these have in the kind of prototypes required quite a lot of electricity to be put into the, computing process to do the image recognition. But perhaps with a bit of refinement, these could become practical. It's not something that we're particularly concerned about in U-Space yet, because in U-Space we consider detect and avoid to be a safety net rather than the primary means of separation. So we are not at the moment requiring detect and avoid to be something fitted to aircraft in U-Space. Instead, we will separate the aircraft very widely so we feel that the residual risk is low enough that the detect and avoid is not necessitated. It will probably become something more significant when we go to higher risk operations, either because the density increases or because we start to have passenger carrying or things like that. So, there the risk might push us towards requiring, a safety net in terms of a collision avoidance system on the aircraft. And there, there is a lot of work being done. But at the moment, U-Space is not mandating any particular implementation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the U-Spaces that you expect to come online this year, the DAA function, as you say, will just be, assured in terms of making sure that the airplanes and drones never come close to each other or the drones themselves right. Is there a difference in how you are thinking about separating drones from manned aviation as opposed to drones versus drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the current functioning of U-Space, the drones are separated by means of the planning. So any drone flying in U-Space must have a plan. It's called a flight authorization request. And these flight authorization requests are de conflicted. So the idea is that we de conflict the plans. If the plans are followed, then we've de conflicted the flights. We can't do this with manned aircraft that wander in. So instead we have this requirement that the manned aircraft are electronically conspicuous. The electronic conspicuity is handled by the U-Space service provider, so it becomes part of the traffic information which is shown to the pilot of the drone. Now the traffic information which is shown to the pilot of the drone differentiates between nearby aircraft which are conforming to their plan, which are, the pilot would be aware of but not concerned by. And nearby aircraft which are not conforming to their plan, which are potentially a threat. These manned aircraft, which are electronically conspicuous, will definitely be in the threat category. So, the, requirement in U-Space is that the drone takes appropriate action, which will be to get out of the way. So that means that this, handling of the manned aircraft, it, it should be safe, but it is going to be an exceptional process. It is going to require that the drone deviates from its plan. I await experience to see how this works, how well we can accommodate manned aircraft, I would not be very comfortable if this was a frequent occurrence, but certainly as it's been described, it is intended to be an infrequent occurrence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in those cases where multiple drone operators are flying in the same area, how will drones be de conflicted and separated from each other?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's done by this planning. The drones will all need to plan. The plans will all be de conflicted. Even if they're using different U-Space service providers, the U-Space service providers between themselves will arrange that the plans are all de conflicted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So these service providers are commercial organizations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. So, the, approach which has been, encapsulated in the U-Space regulation is that the provision of services is a competitive commercial activity. So, we expect multiple service providers, or we hope for multiple service providers and that they will compete, they will innovate, they will offer added value to their customers. The U-Space regulation describes six services which they should provide, four of which are always required. The other two may be required depending on what the, Competent Authority says about the U-Space airspace and we expect that these commercial operators will offer their customers a service which fits the customer's need. If the aircraft operator has a need for, high precision, high efficiency, they're probably willing to pay for that, and they will be paying for tools which allow the kind of things they want to do. If the aircraft operator has lower requirements, they may be able to get by with a cheaper offering. So we expect these U-Space service providers to occupy niches, have particular specializations and to innovate in the area. So EASA, and the aim of the European Union was to create hopefully a single European market for U-Space service provision. So we would see the emergence of U-Space service providers who could operate in multiple European countries. We would get economies of scale and we would quite quickly arrive at innovation high performance and, hopefully the lowest possible price.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, this four dimensional flight path de confliction strategic planning issue, there's been some research that showed that you really can't be very confident looking more than, several minutes, into the future because things happen in real life. There's weather, there's contingencies, there's all kinds of things. How well do you think that this approach will, handle the real world?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's a continuous trade off. The, plan that the aircraft operator is asked to submit is not a line, but a series of boxes. And we asked the aircraft operator to plan these boxes, as large as they need to be that the aircraft operator has a confidence of 95 percent that they can follow this plan. So, it's not clearly spelled out, but if an aircraft operator is consistently planning too small, they will deviate very often and they will often end up in a contingency situation and they will have to invoke a contingency plan because they're unable to follow the plan that they've submitted. The other option is that the aircraft operator is very conservative and, submits enormous boxes. They say, like, all of the city for all of the afternoon, and they will simply find that they're in conflict with everybody else. So, there should be a natural pressure that the aircraft operator begins to master their uncertainties, that they begin to understand what weather will bring, and they will plan in function of their ability to fly. We, would anticipate that they would hopefully get better at this. We would hope that they could vary their speed, for example, they wouldn't always fly as fast as possible. So they have a bit of margin to deal with unexpected gusts of winds and so on. So we would hope that, in a mature U-Space, the aircraft operators are able to plan in a manner, which is sufficiently sized so that they can conform to the plan, but sufficiently small that they don't simply conflict with everybody else.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is it likely that their uncertainty will increase the more minutes into the future that they're planning? You know, they might be able to be quite precise four minutes, five minutes, seven minutes into the future in terms of where the aircraft is going to be in the plan, but if it was a very long flight, would that change towards the end of the flight or is that something that people are mitigating?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We, that, that model is generally true, but there has been work in manned aviation with what's called, trajectory based operations, where we can essentially have the idea of a kind of four dimensional contract where the aircraft will speed up and slow down in order to be within the agreed performance. The question is really a trade off. How much is the aircraft operator prepared to sacrifice in terms of flying at the most efficient speed and the straightest line compared with flying in order to be able to get their plan approved. So we would imagine there'll be a bit of give and take there, a bit of trade off, and I would imagine that once a U-Space airspace is running, the aircraft operator would be, well, complaining, would be reporting to the competent authority if the planning constraints were holding back their business. There is likely to be a requirement that the, competent authority would revisit the airspace risk assessment. And one input into that is the expected traffic. And I would expect that the aircraft operators would probably take the opportunity to express their desire for a different compromise on separation should they find it too constraining.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do people discuss things like, you know, afternoon thunderstorms that come up that might throw the entire plan out the window in this type of an architecture?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They do, but certainly, bad weather is probably less of an issue in Europe than in the US.

Yeah, absolutely. Now, the trigger, surprisingly, might not be the density, because, eventually, when we can't master the uncertainties at the strategic phase, we have to try and master the uncertainties at the tactical phase. And then we would be required to do tactical conflict resolution. Once we have tactical conflict resolution, we can allow more residual risk to remain after the strategic. But one of the big drivers of uncertainty are passengers. So I could quite imagine that the introduction of passenger operations, these eVTOLs carrying passengers around, would quite quickly push towards the need for tactical services. The passenger typically is going to have an impact on the take off time predictability. If the person has to get into the vehicle, might be their first flight, might feel a bit unsure, might feel a bit frightened or unwell. I could quite, imagine that relating to a, it takes longer than expected to close the door and then they miss the takeoff time. So I could quite imagine that we would have to go to a process where the aircraft are not de conflicted strategically, but are subject to a demand capacity balancing process and then are being de conflicted tactically. And I would say that's going to be the big push, but once we have Tactical Deconfliction, we can use it to increase the capacity of U-Space airspaces as needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I mean, this entire conversation around strategic planning, just evokes the famous Mike Tyson quote that everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. So, and, so, why especially among aviation professionals that know that things happen in the real world. It never goes according to plan. It's weather, it's, all kinds of different things, right? And so, why is there so little emphasis on tactical means is it because the technology is not there?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So why is it all strategic? Well, because we currently don't have any confidence in the surveillance. In order to do tactical maneuvers, you need to know where the aircraft are. You need to know with a known level of uncertainty where the aircraft are. And we don't today know what that level of uncertainty is. You will notice in the U-Space regulation that conformance monitoring is optional today. That's because conformance monitoring also requires that we have confidence in and have characterized the level of the surveillance that we can locate the aircraft during flight. And we don't today have that level of confidence. So the initial use of U-Space will be almost completely based on this strategic de confliction, and because of that, the margins for all of these uncertainties will have to be very large, so the aircraft will be very far apart. Once we begin to see flights, and we begin to get some experience, we can begin to characterize how well does the surveillance work. And in the U-Space regulation, there's this thing called Network Remote Identification, where the aircraft is sending to the U-Space service provider its position and the time and its identity. We will observe that for quite a while before we begin to rely on that. There may be opportunities to confirm how well that system is working. Interestingly enough, one of the users of U-Space is Israel, and in Israel, for security reasons, they have been doing a lot of monitoring the position of these aircraft by other means, and have been able to determine reasonably well how well this network remote ID is working. And certainly they have now scaled their separation minima in function of their confidence in this network remote ID. In the rest of the U-Space community, we still lack that experience, and I would expect most competent authorities would want to see traffic in their own cities, in their own U-Space airspace, and understand how well the surveillance is working before they begin to rely on it. So this is why we will have essentially have to have a time delay before we can get to any kind of tactical service. The first tactical service would be conformance monitoring. Conformance monitoring would allow, these margins for uncertainty to be reduced. They would allow the separation to be reduced a bit. And then, once we're really confident we would be able to introduce tactical services where we're giving instructions to de conflict the aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the rough timeline for this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I, optimistically, we'll see this stuff experimentally very short term but to have it rolled out generally, it could be another 10 years before everybody is really confident about this and it becomes routine, widespread.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned a little bit, different ways of, detecting. Acoustic, Optical, et cetera. Can you spend a bit more time, and perhaps broaden that list, including Radar and some of the others and comment the pros and cons, of each and what you believe is the most attractive option.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To detect a non cooperative target, the problem with radar is that you illuminate the target with your own radio. So the amount of power that needs to be pushed out in order to get an echo back is enormous. The power falls off in proportion to the fourth power of the distance. So, you can be transmitting thousands of Watts and get microWatts back. So it's a very difficult job to do. And as I said, there are similar targets which will give clutter. There are cars and birds and things like that. Typically, we're seeing radar reserved for situations where the high cost, can be justified despite the low range and the not fantastic performance of these systems, but still it's better than nothing. Much more interesting to use optical where the illumination comes from the sun and you only have to capture the reflection. There is work going on there. I haven't been so involved in using optical, processes to detect drones for example, surveillance, but in terms of, collision avoidance, there's been quite a lot of research done in universities about this. And I think we're potentially seeing, this leading to practical systems in the reasonably short term. Hear and avoid is in the very early days, but it potentially, has quite some benefit. It's very good at detecting light aircraft, for example, or helicopters, which are especially noisy. Then we get onto collaborative means. If the other aircraft would like to be detected, radio based systems are obviously one option. The problem there, though, is finding radio frequencies which are available. Proposals for the electronic conspicuity which are coming from EASA include, one of these industrial scientific and medical radio frequencies, which is all very well, but it may suffer from interference. Another option would be, acoustic or, optical broadcasting, so, some kind of flashing light or ultrasound or something like that. And I think work is going on all of these, but, Yeah, I haven't been involved particularly in any research project which is looking at that. My, my main interest so far has been traffic management rather than on vehicle systems. Our colleagues over, at, Johns Hopkins are looking at a, there is a, some work going on developing a replacement for TCAS. TCAS in the generic term is referred to in the industry as ACAS, and the project which was developing a replacement for that was ACASX. ACASX spawned some variants, one of which was ACAS XU, which was for unmanned. Quite some work has been done on that. And, Josh Silbermann at Johns Hopkins was leading a project called ACAS SXU for small unmanned. And that was pretty promising. I've not been involved in that for a year or more, but it looked like it was going to go somewhere. So that was looking at using a system which would be compatible with manned aircraft. So, I think if that comes to, fruition, it's quite likely that standard would be adopted quite widely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Has there been any research on the potential for detecting the RF energy that's being emitted by the drone's propulsion system, perhaps the speed controllers or other sources of, what most of us would refer to as EMI, but detecting that in a useful way.

Projects which I've been aware of have more focused on the command and control link, which, is easier to detect and also easier to interrupt. There have been some, different approaches with that, because certainly, you can buy this box from DJI, this aeroscope to listen in on their communications. It makes it more obvious about what to jam if you want to jam the thing, and also you can listen on the telemetry. You can find out where the aircraft is, where the aircraft operator is, and things like that from listening into the command and control. So it's very beneficial to do that. The problem is if somebody doesn't want to be seen, they will encrypt that or they will use other methods. If they're already criminal in the way that they operate the aircraft, they can be criminal in the way they use the radio spectrum. So it is a harder task to detect and stop somebody who doesn't want to be detected and stopped.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's talk a little bit more about the service organizations you've talked about, Andrew. What's the barrier to entry for some of these organizations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The barrier to entry is probably, not enormous, but it's certainly there are fewer companies pitching into the service provision area than we saw emerge trying to build aircraft. So maybe it's not such fun. But if you look at the ones who are active today, I would single out the team at Wing as having put a lot of energy into developing standards and trying to create an environment, for U-Space for UTM. But Wing are a bit unusual in that they have no particular desire to be a service provider. They are, they see service provision as being just a necessary step so that they can become an aircraft operator. Amazon have also been active in that area. Again, Amazon, I believe, will only be their own service provider, but they've certainly contributed to the standards which are being evolved, and they've taken, quite some role in, in driving the industry. So those two are combined aircraft operator service providers. In terms of who else is in the service provision? You have a few companies who are pure service providers. I would, mention Dronic in Germany and, D Flight in Italy. and each of those kind of emerged before the U-Space regulation was published. And at that time, there was a slight expectation that they would become the kind of the appointed national service provider. But they are purely service providers. Behind them, there are companies writing software for service providers, and there are more of those, and I would mention. ANRA is one, which is operating in Europe and the USA. Unifly is based in Belgium. They've done well, supplying software to different, operating companies. OneSky, another, American company, which is seen in Europe. Drone Radar in Poland. and some of these, although they are primarily aiming at being software suppliers, some of them are in the process of becoming certified as service providers to prove themselves and also to make up for the fact that other service providers are not stepping forward. I know that ANRA are in the process of being certified at the moment, and we might see them offering services possibly in Switzerland, I don't know, but, they may see that as a necessary step. There are some of the larger ATM companies involved in the business, like Collins, Frequentis, Indra, and Thales, and all of these are looking at parts of the business, Frequentis is probably more looking at the other end. In the European model, there is the U-Space service provider, which, delivers services to the UAS operator. And then there's another body called The Common Information Service Provider. And Frequentis are looking at supplying software to those. The Common Information Service Provider is, a role which the state may appoint one or may decide not to and that role is involved in distributing information to everybody. And so Frequentis are looking at that, Indra are looking at that. So there are different larger companies looking at joining this market. I've met most of these companies through participation in European research projects. So when we've been, looking at, doing research, I've particularly been involved in research projects, looking at really fundamental questions at low maturity. I've worked with many of these companies, in these research projects, trying to answer very basic questions. How should things work? How do we solve these simple questions. What does a flight plan look like? And how do we deal with it? And so on. So, that's where I've met them. I've, I could mention even more. There's, Airbus UTM, who were previously known as Altiscope. They have a simulator. I'm working with them, they have a reference implementation of UTM in their simulator. There's a strong team there, they're very active in the development of standards, they're very active in the, work that's being done at ICAO, looking out how we can, integrate, this UAS stuff into the ICAO annexes and documents. We also have other smaller companies, the Technological Institute of Galicia has developed some UTM system, which has been adopted by Boeing. Boeing have a team in Madrid who are really expert at simulation of aerodynamics. And so Boeing have developed a simulator for, UAS which uses the ITG system to offer a complete package. There's a company called Open Skies operating. It's a very small company, but they've developed an open source, implementation of a kind of uTM system, which although it doesn't, isn't fully functional or it's partly functional, it is very compliant with the available standards. And because of the standards, compliance, their tool, Flight Blender, is widely being used for testing, often in combination with the, automatic testing mechanism of the, inter USS, which is an implementation of the, Discovery and Synchronization Service. Inter USS is also open source and it's a reference implementation of the DSS and includes within it a testing function. People are using that to test their system and they're using FlightBlender as a reference to compare their system against.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The big outstanding question is how do these companies make money, right? What's the willingness to pay?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a question I simply can't answer. These are very tough times to be in this business, because there's not enough flying yet. We suffer a bootstrap problem in this domain that until there's traffic management, there won't be flying. Until there's flying, there won't be traffic management. So somebody has to get it started, and these companies are all hoping it starts soon. Because without flying, there won't be a revenue stream for many of them. I still wonder how many, the market has room for. I have good friends in all these companies. I wish them all very well, but honestly, it's a tough business. I don't envy their position.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew talk about the origin of U-Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So U-Space, we started with, an idea that there would be traffic management and in the research domain, we looked to the end goal from the beginning. And the end goal was that we would be able to control all traffic, including passenger carrying operations. The other thing that happened quite quickly in Europe was, the European Commission identified that UAS was going to be an area of important commercial activity. So, they wanted to promote U-Space. So, top down, Europe got to work on regulations. Regulations are valuable in Europe because we are 27 European Union member states. It would be quite likely that without a top down European regulation, we would have 27 completely different implementations. So the view of the European Union was that they would like to promote a single market. They wanted a harmonized environment where an operator, an aircraft operator or a U-Space service provider operating in one European country could move to a neighboring European country without difficulty. So this is why in Europe there was a rush to produce a U-Space regulation. This U-Space regulation has described how to fly beyond visual line of sight and it's described an airspace in which this is possible called a U-Space airspace. Now in America you have a totally different set of problems and you have a totally different environment. The Federal Aviation Authority is both the regulator and the service provider. And it was quite clear that Congress wasn't excited about the FAA becoming a service provider to drones. So I would say that the momentum in the USA was held back. It wasn't being driven by the FAA. Industry was driving this, wanted to do some stuff. The FAA was following on, making it possible, but observing, and we now see the gestation of this part 108. It will hopefully be available for comment this year. I think I slightly envy the position the FAA are in, in that they will be able to write Part 108, taking into account experience and observation of flying, which is, which has taken place, without their regulation. And so I think, the rest of us will look at the American regulation. I mean, Some people might say, Oh, it's behind, but. It won't be behind. I think we're all moving at the same speed. The American regulation will benefit from having been written, having taken into account the experience that's being gained, for example, at the moment in Fort Worth, with seven different operators flying, seven different service providers supporting them. And so the learnings from that experience can be fed back into regulation. Yes, there are big differences in the current situation, but I think in general, we're pretty similar in what's driving this, that the drones are there and we need to take care of them. They may pose a risk to the other aviation. They may pose a risk to the public. In general, the Aviation Safety Authority is tasked with dealing with that. So drone regulation is a natural outcome. And the second is that in, in both the US and in Europe, there is a political imperative to enable this stuff. So the regulation is not purely restrictive. It is trying to let this stuff occur. So I, I think, we are following slightly different paths, but we're going to the same place quite quickly. And, in my domain, in the research domain, we have a healthy cooperation with both NASA and the FAA. We meet, we compare notes, we discuss. So there is not any fundamental difference in outlook or opinion. But there are some. Some differences in just, like, the way things have ended up. Our regulation came first. Our regulation particularly pushed this idea that service provision would be a competitive market. It could be, that in some states they're not bothered about that. They might want to simply appoint a single service provider, as is often done for, manned aviation. So you know, that's a choice that Europe has made so it's not necessarily the only choice, but it's the one that, in which I'm working. And, it's a similar choice that has been made in the USA. FAA doesn't want to be the service provider, so there'll be a market for service provision.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:18:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What notable differences exist in the way that the FAA and EASA think about strategic and tactical deconfliction?

So the work that's been done in the USA, on the passenger carrying operations started with this question. Is it when, well, it started with the question, what is it? And then they might discover that it was similar to, managing small UAS. In Europe, we started with the question, can we extend the system, which is designed to manage small UAS? can we extend that system to manage passenger operations? So in America, you'll hear these terms like pSU, Provider of Services to, I don't know what the U is, UAM. and we have discovered from the work done at NASA that it's very similar. One of the key differences is in the world of the passenger carrying operations, the PSU will not do strategic conflict resolution. The PSU will make, with a demand capacity balance, they will limit the number of aircraft entering the airspace to the level that the tactical processes can safely deal with, and then the separation will be tactically achieved by, well, by means which are, still under discussion, actually, because, one of the interesting things about this work on, urban air mobility in the U. S. A. is this idea that there will be these community based rules, and these community based rules are still being worked out. We in Europe are being a bit more top down, we are saying it's going to be the similar approach which was, is being used for small UAS. So we're, at the moment, we're talking about strategic followed by tactical. It may be in future that we might drop the strategic. I don't know. It depends. That's the subject at the moment for research. But, the model that we're working on today would be a strategic with a certain residual risk and then tactical to deal with that residual risk.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Andrew, paint a picture of what the next five or so years looks like in relation to U-Space drone operations in Europe and potentially beyond.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think, I would really seriously hope that within five years we see, operations of a commercial nature in Europe. I would expect to see a revision of the acceptable means of compliance of the U-Space Regulation. I would expect to see the American Part 108 has been published and is in use. I hope, but I'm not expecting a revision of the U-Space Regulation itself. Regulations are hard things to change. I would like to see, commercial operations. I would expect that they would probably be focused on niche areas where there's an obvious business case. And one of the most interesting areas that we're seeing in Europe is harbours and port areas. A lot of processes in harbours and port areas require somebody to get into a boat, or if you were going to do an aerial observation, It's very expensive with a helicopter. So there are many things that people want to do that they cannot. And so I would imagine, as we're already seeing in Rotterdam, Antwerp, and in, Hamburg Harbor, we will see a growth of use of, drones and, implementation of, U-Space or U-Space like currently, but hopefully official U-Space in Harbor areas. This is, I believe, commercially viable today. The other area, which, is a pressing area of interest is delivery, but delivery today in Europe is tending towards suburban, so it's not really an urban activity. And I would imagine that, the kind of pilot projects that we see in Ireland, in Finland, in Norway, we're working with a company called Aviant, which is delivering around Trondheim in a rural area. We would see these increase in number and we would see them being enclosed inside U-Space airspaces. And we will see these U-Space airspaces popping up like, like mushrooms on a lawn. We will probably be a, not obvious why they're there, but then you go and look and you find there's, here in this place, there's a niche where commercial operations are viable. I would say that the, my least expectation is that it becomes focused on urban, in each case. I would say that probably suburban or harbor will be my initial one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:23:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew you've been doing this for a while.

If you, hear some of the stories which are being told about, what people want to do, I would say, is it really realistic to try and compete with ground transport? And you may recall, an experimental project that was done by Airbus, pre COVID, a thing called VOOM, where they set up a kind of on demand helicopter flight service in San Paolo. San Paolo has the benefit of having a large number of helipads, has a quite a large population of helicopters, many of which are sitting idle most of the day, and it also has terrible traffic problems. So there was a willingness among the public, or some members of the public, to pay quite a lot for a short flight and that made this VOOM thing viable. I would say if you're going to come into this business, you need to understand what is the specific set of circumstances where your business will work. And if you come in with a general approach, we're going to deliver cups of coffee. I would say, like really, how can that be better than the man on the bicycle or whatever the alternative is today, you really have to understand what is your value added and where is the niche where that value added is appreciated. And yeah, I wouldn't today be looking at trying to replace or compete with the metro or even taxis in many cities. I'm sorry if I disappoint my colleagues in the taxi business, but really you have to be pretty good to do better than public transport in most European cities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:24:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew this has been a great conversation.

Welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Robert Rose co-founder and CEO of Reliable Robotics. Listen, few have Robert's pedigree to create systems for autonomous aircraft with his work and leadership at Reliable Robotics, as well as from his position as Director of Flight Software at Space X and at Tesla, where they worked on bringing to market the first consumer automobile with fully unassisted self-driving capability. This is a conversation about autonomy. We discussed the arc of automation and what evolved in the conversation, the arc of safety in aviation from its early days to today. You'll notice how Robert will closely and consistently link autonomy to safety in the beginning, throughout and at the end of the conversation; an irrefutable argument. He essentially says autonomy is going to happen so get used to it. But he makes the hard medicine taste just a bit better by tying the key arguments to safety. We spend a bit of time on the motivation for pursuing autonomous flight by segment GA part 1 35, 1 21 with a safety imperative with automation being more required in the former than in the latter. After a few attempts, we eventually get to other reasons why autonomy is needed in addition to, and beyond the safety case. As we've discussed many times the podcasts, we discussed the need for autonomy for many of the advanced air mobility business models to scale, and to meet their financial projections. Robert discusses the autonomous capabilities of Reliable Robotics, and as Robert says, what makes them unique is their ground up designs for automation and certification, where it's more difficult for others to go back and design for automation if that wasn't the original intention. We spent a lot of time discussing the processes required to certify automation systems. And you'll notice that we make every attempt to quantify the addressable market for autonomy and for Reliable Robotics at each of its stages today and in the future. Robert deftly steers the path to the size of the overall aviation market. We try to stay focused on the addressable market in the next five years and what opportunities within Reliable Robotics are tied exclusively to the Caravan and how easy it is to transition the capabilities to other aircraft. Next is a really interesting discussion around the design of their air to air radar it's value, market size, and why build it on their own versus purchasing off the shelf radar and whether or not it's core to their autonomy focus or perhaps a distraction to that focus. This naturally leads to a discussion around their airspace integration solution, including capabilities from their own radar and integrating data from other sources and the dependency on those solutions. And a discussion around the availability and value of primary radar data, where some would say, including me, it's availability is a lot further away than most people think especially given justifiably how long it took to release secondary radar data to industry. Listen to what Robert says is his biggest upcoming challenges if he had to pick one. He wraps up his talk with great advice to entrepreneurs. Robert, thanks for joining us and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Robert Rose as you innovate in The Vertical Space. Robert's deep engineering experience spans over 20 years across aerospace, self-driving cars and robotics. Prior to co-founding Reliable Robotics, in his role as Director of Flight Software at SpaceX, Robert was responsible for flight, ground, simulation and data management software successfully launching and operating the first 10 Falcon 9 rockets, 5 Dragon spacecraft, and Grasshopper VT VL tests. He led the development of the onboards flight software for their first commercial mission to the international space station, for which he received special recognition from NASA. At Tesla, Robert brought to market the first consumer automobile with fully unassisted self-driving capability. He led the team through developing novel computer vision, human machine interfaces and control technologies resulting in the successful deployment of the autopilot 1.0 and the 7.0 version of Tesla's instrument panel. At Google X, Robert led a development team on a secret project combining AI techniques with practical robotic systems to bring advanced machine perception and manipulation technologies to large vehicles. Earlier in his career, Robert contributed to three\"Game of the Year\" award winning titles during his time at Sony PlayStation and worked at HP as a software engineer. Robert is a presidentially invited Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Robert holds multiple patents, a BS in Computer Science, a BS in Computer Engineering and an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Oregon State University. Robert, welcome to The Vertical Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, great to be here. Thank you for having me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First question, is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's a couple of different ways I could take this. I could take this, the, are you asking, Robert the individual or Robert the company? let me take the, company perspective. we started Reliable Robotics because we felt that somebody needed to cut a different path from everybody else in, in the UAM, AAM, RAM, new aviation space. We felt very strongly that somebody needed to focus specifically on autonomy and autonomy in the United States, because at the time, and I think this is still true today, I still hear from folks, people say, well, well, this is never going to happen. We're never going to have autonomous aircraft or this is never going to happen in the United States. It's going to happen in Dubai or New Zealand or Brazil or someplace like that first. Or people say, well, nobody, even if we have autonomy, nobody's going to buy it. Customers aren't going to want it. Pilots will never allow it. Passengers will never accept it. And I feel that a lot of these criticisms are still true to some extent today, or at least many people still hold these, and bring up these criticisms. We obviously, I obviously feel quite different. I believe this will happen. It will happen very soon. It will happen in the United States. I believe there is a path to bring this technology forward that, pilots and other stakeholders in aviation will accept. And we can talk more about that later. And I think ultimately we'll get to a place where passengers are going to accept it. this is the future. I think the near future is going to have orders of magnitude more aircraft in the sky, and the way that we get there is with greater levels of autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>when you say it's here, it's going to happen. and people are going to accept it. So what level of automation are you describing when you say it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm referring to automated aircraft that enable you to take the pilot out of the plane and into a control center, place them into a control center. This requires an aircraft that's capable of fully automated taxi, takeoff, and landing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now you mentioned, you have, you had a professional response to those who, don't always agree with you on something. And then you said you had a personal as well. So what's the personal?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I want aviation to be safer. I'm a pilot and I think there's a lot of people that get into aviation because they have that love of, grabbing the controls and, they are the airplane, be the airplane. And there's a part of me that I get that, I understand the appeal. I think, unlike many that get into aviation, I also appreciate it for what it enables you to do and where it enables you to go. And I value the where you can go with aviation more than the experience of aviation, if that makes any sense. And for me, I want more automation in the cockpit. to ensure my safety, the safety of my family and others that I take in the plane with me. I've had several occasions in my limited experience flying where I've gotten myself into trouble and I wish there was a land now button in the aircraft. I think there should be a land now button in all airplanes. not just a system that's certified for emergency use only, but a normal use Autoland gets you back into a safe configuration and on the ground. and we have aspects of this today in airplanes. we've got wings levelers and emergency autoland and autopilots that can do heading changes and capture an approach and do all of that, but I don't think that goes far enough. I think there's a lot more that we can do to make aircraft safer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, before we get into, the meat of the discussion, you used the word safety now, 15 times in a couple of minutes,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>two or three, exactly two or three\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you for noticing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>two or three years ago, would safety have been mentioned as much as the use case for automation or what was your value proposition a couple of years ago for automation and fully autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I feel like we've been consistent on this from the beginning. Now, I think the larger conversation this industry has been having has been shifting. And I think that's because folks or others are recognizing that, the way you get the FAA and larger customers excited about this technology is you do that through safety by improving safety. I don't know if that answers your question. is that what you're getting at?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, there's a piece of me that says, well, you can't argue with safety. although I question whether people will pay for safety, you can't argue with safety. But yes, the many people listening right now will think, oh, we're going to talk about automation, we're going to talk about fully autonomous flight, we're going to talk about the economic value, we're going to talk about pilotless flights, which is extraordinarily controversial. But in some ways, you've steered a path here that is not controversial. Who can argue with safety? And you're saying that's a deliberate act for a variety of reasons.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, if you look at what stakeholders in the aviation industry care about, safety is the first thing that they talk about. If you look at, well just step back and look at the history of technology advancements we've had in airplanes over the last a hundred plus years. why has anything in an aircraft changed? It's changed to make the airplane safer. Like that's not an accident. I actually would be interested in knowing about improvements that were made strictly for economic reasons. Okay, maybe winglets come to mind. But most technologies, or at least electronic, avionic technologies, are there to prevent accidents and save lives. Period. And I think autonomy fits within that same trajectory. Autonomy or autonomous aircraft. It is just, it is an incremental set of enhancements on top of the incremental enhancements we've been making over the last several decades. I don't see the advanced navigation system that we're developing a whole lot different than what has been done in previous years with GPS, ILS, and other radio navigation systems, and even going all the way back to light beacon navigation systems. these are all technology enhancements to help improve safety. the automated landing system that we developed, I think, fits within that same trajectory of, automated landing systems and automated approach systems that have been developed to date. Our automated take off system, which is really a take off rejection system, fits largely within what's been happening in the industry for, for decades on automated monitoring of aircraft configuration during take off and take off rejection systems, And finally, automated taxiing, I see that, as a bit more new and novel, but from a core technology standpoint, really just builds on systems that are already going into aircraft. and even now, it's, our automated taxi system, I would say, builds on taxi planning features that you have in an EFB now, and it's just taking that one tiny step further, to ultimately improve the safety of you, the pilot, the occupants of the aircraft, and the people that operate around that aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm sure a lot in our audience all have, pretty good familiarity with aviation history and the milestones that were achieved over the last century. But from your perspective and from the perspective of what you're building at Reliable, What are the key milestones along that arc in terms of putting in place the building blocks and setting the precedence for autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, we, and you're referring here specifically to the history of aviation. what are key milestones throughout the last century?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, Full Authority Digital Engine Control. Huge. I think we need FADECs in every plane. I think it's ridiculous that small aircraft, expect you to sit there and manage mixture and, prop speed and all of those other components. it, it should just be, fully automatic. At the very least, we should have auto throttles in every plane. Instrument landing system goes back to the 40s. I believe the first experiments were in the 40s with automated landing systems, and then that technology was further developed in the 50s, and then commercialized first in the 60s. I think it was the, I think it was the Trident, I think it was British Airways, I could be wrong, that first deployed that technology, and that drove, developments in fault tolerant computing, I think, is something we take for granted because the space race was occurring around the same time, but the first real commercialization of a fault tolerant computing system was an Autoland system. This goes back to the 60s. NASA in the 70s built, I can't recall the acronym, I just remember that it wasn't the best choice for an acronym, but they built a, oh, it was the Terminally Configured Aircraft Program. they built a flight management system that allowed you to specify a flight path through all phases of flight, takeoff, enroute, and all the way to landing. And they actually flew this, it was on a Boeing aircraft. I can't recall exactly which model. GPS also stands out as another huge safety benefit. switching from, ILS approaches, which require expensive, infrastructure to be installed at the airport and then maintained. By the way, the FAA has a small army of pilots that just do nothing but fly around the country to monitor approaches and to make sure all the radio signals are correct. Moving away from that and towards a satellite constellation system has gone a long way to improve safety because it's enabled so many more airports to have RNAV approaches. That's huge! Think about all the accidents that we had before from people messing up approaches and going visual before they should have, or scud running. a lot of that has gone away. It's gone a huge way to improve safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>let's stay on the history of flight. Talk about the arc of automation and aviation from the early days.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we go all the way back to the Sperry autopilot, would be the start of it. I believe those tests were done first in the 30s, and then instrument landing system, as I mentioned, fault tolerant computing associated with that developed in the 60s. I think other key moments, key inflection points would be, Automated descent systems that monitor depressurization events, and then will bring an aircraft back down, to a safe altitude. I don't want to get too dark, but there have been some accidents recently where if that technology had been in those Private aircraft, it would have saved lives, but it does exist in a few large, commercial aircraft. there's a GA Avionics manufacturer that, promotes this as a product. I don't know off the top of my head how many aircraft have actually adopted this system, but, That, I think, is huge. for us, that's very significant because, automated descent following a depressurization event, you've got there a system that at very high integrity is monitoring for an adverse condition or an anomalous condition in the aircraft. And without asking the pilot, it's taking over the plane and putting the plane into a safe configuration. It's descending down to a safe altitude to save the lives of everybody that's on board the aircraft. And we talk about, that as like a key inflection point internally, because that's a time when you've got, an automated system taking over from a human, and in a split second manner, acting to take control of the aircraft. and you can't find a straight line between that technology and the regulations. the closest regulation being 91. 3, the pilot is the ultimate authority for the safe operation of the aircraft. here you've got the automation taking that responsibility, and that's significant precedence for us. and a lot of the system that we're developing now leverages on that precedence, or builds upon that precedence, I should say.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, as we pursue, autonomous flight. Let's talk about the motivation for, this goal and let's do it on a segment by segment basis. So describe for each of the, part 121 operations or 135 or general aviation or UAS systems for that matter. Why do each of those segments really care about fully autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, so GA, 121, 135, and then you had UAS, which I assume you're referring to small UAS\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>correct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>okay, sub 55 pounds. The Box Droppers, as we affectionately call them. GA, I think, has a clear need to improve safety. there's this myth that is commonly propagated that aviation is the safest mode of transportation. And that's true for certain 121 operations. That's definitely not true for GA. And there's a couple of papers that were published in the last several years that dug into the data here and concluded that, flying small aircraft, and this is GA, and certain 135 operations is actually 8 to 15 times more dangerous than driving on a per mile basis. I found this shocking. my intuition was planes are probably not safer than driving smaller planes. I didn't know it was this much worse. and so there, the motivation is to improve safety. That then ties to a very clear economic or business imperative. if you talk to almost any small airplane manufacturer, they will tell you that the biggest impediment to them selling more aircraft is the significant other. I don't want you getting in that thing, or I'm not getting in that thing with you. And systems like, parachutes and whatnot have gone a long way to alleviate some of those concerns, but not all of them. My strong belief is higher levels of automation are going to improve safety and thus expand general aviation to even more people, which I think is very exciting. I know my significant other, my wife, would be very excited about this and much more comfortable flying with me if she knew that we had a land now button.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I agree. General aviation does have a much more pronounced safety problem, but what about part 121 operations and 135?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll take 135 next. I'll take these in, in order from smallest to biggest. So in 135 operations, you also have a safety imperative. Here you've got, aircraft that are frequently operated single pilot, frequently operated at lower altitudes in, More adverse weather conditions than what you would see in 121 operations. And the nature of the work, tends to be a little bit less, What's the word I'm looking for? A little bit less structured than what in 1 2 1 operations. safety management systems, for example, are not required of all 1 3 5 operations. They should be, but they're not. small 135 operations don't have the FAA requirement. certain operators impose. They voluntarily adopt SMS. I think that's great. more operations should do that. But there, I don't want to get dark again and start citing specific accidents, but if you Google around, 135 accidents, especially 135 cargo accidents, you'll see some very unfortunate events where, People have gotten themselves into some pretty sticky situations that could have been prevented with automation. so there's a safety imperative there. The business, motivation in 135 is a bit different. I'm going to say pilot shortage. that shouldn't be shocking to anybody, but the pilot shortage in the 121 realm is trickling down to the 135 realm, and it is vacuuming up pilots out of 135 operations at a very fast rate. I hear from operators quite frequently that turnover is extremely high. it's getting harder to recruit and retain people. Salaries are skyrocketing. And on top of all of this, because of the accidents we were talking about earlier, insurance and training and other factors are all becoming more expensive, so it's becoming harder to find people to run these operations. For some operators that I've spoken with, it's existential. They say that they may not be able to run their operation in the near future because of pilots, and so they need to look at automation. they need to look at ways they can, Get more people, trained up, which you can do with improved levels of automation, or move to remote piloting as our technology is moving. so finally, in the 121 realm, you've got some different dynamics. pilot shortage is definitely a topic of conversation, but, I think safety, it's not talked about that much publicly, but Congress has been bringing it up as of late. we've had a few incidents that have occurred at major U. S. airports that made headlines that could have been prevented with certified alerting and guidance and higher levels of automation. And I think the industry needs that to be able to keep operations efficiently flowing and to maintain public confidence in the aviation system. I don't think you can draw a straight line between pilot shortage and automation. I'm not ready to go there. I think some folks in the industry are trying to draw a straight line, but I think it's going to be several more years before, the pilot shortage is a direct driver of automation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>can you go a layer deeper, either in the Part 135 safety cases that you reference or Part 121, and give the audience some examples of a dangerous situation that occurred and the cause of it and how automation would have prevented it because obviously in aviation there are many different causes that lead to an accident. Some of them can be weather related, some of them can be, a failure of some part of the aircraft, or it can be a failure of communications. help us connect the dots between how automation specifically would alleviate certain types of accidents.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, I'll have to go back further because I I don't like to talk about recent accidents until the NTSB has completed their reports. I don't think it's appropriate to draw conclusions. but there was an accident about, a year ago involving, a Caravan pilot where, this hits pretty close to home for us, where they were attempting a, a landing, at an airport in northwestern United States, and the weather was pretty close to minimums, and they came down, broke out, and, were not able to make contact with, the runway, or they didn't break out, they weren't able to make contact with the runway, visual contact, they performed a go around, and it appears from the preliminary reports that I've read that, They decided then to descend, believing they understood the airport environment, broke out, and then, ran into some fixed infrastructure on the ground. And, this breaks my heart because, there's just no reason they needed to die. If they'd had a system that enabled, Zero Visibility Autoland, if they had a high precision navigation system that gave them a glide slope and localizer that they could track, then they could have shot this all the way down to the ground through the clouds and missed that fixed infrastructure. Some have speculated that it was a poorly designed, approach procedure, and the runway and that fixed infrastructure never should have allowed an automated approach, but, there's ways to do it. could have had a slightly higher glide slope, and we could have given this person something that would have saved their life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>as tragic as it is, it's not a case for adopting a remotely controlled aircraft though, right? How do you draw a line from that to remote control of aircraft as being the answer, as opposed to other safety enhancing, tools and systems on the aircraft from, navigation, better situational awareness, et cetera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the first system that we're developing is a fully automated aircraft that still has a pilot on board. our first step is not remote piloting. our first step is give the people in the cockpit, more sophisticated tools to prevent them from getting in those situations. And that does lead eventually to remote piloting, but there's a lot of other technologies that have to be added to the aircraft in order to enable remote piloting, such as air to air radar and more robust, communication systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you talk to your customers, part 135 mostly, I assume, do they admit that they have a safety problem? Is that what the business case revolves around?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's a substantial component, and for the reasons I mentioned earlier, there's, it comes first from a genuine desire to not put people at, a higher level of risk than necessary. If we can do something to prevent accidents and save lives, then damn it, that's what we need to do. and the customers that we talk to, the customers we spend a lot of time with, that's what they say. This is about saving lives. Having said that, there are other benefits that come along with it, once you move to remote piloting. I mentioned earlier, training, training becomes much simpler, much more straightforward. being able to reposition aircraft becomes much more straightforward. Being able to up gauge and down gauge the aircraft, flying aircraft that is appropriate for the mission or right sized for the mission is another benefit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>tell us how your concept for remote operations, how that is fundamentally different to how the military is operating its MQ 1s, MQ 9s, or for that matter the QF aircraft series.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>our system is more like Global Hawk than the old Predator system. we don't have a joystick. there's no rudder pedals. there's no live stream video feed that lets you hand fly the plane down to the ground. our system Works, very much like an FMS, because it is an FMS that we've modified, and in fact, the first system that we're certifying, the system with the pilot in the plane, they're programming the aircraft through our flight management system. It's a slightly more, sophisticated flight plan than what you would do today. Today, you would go into a plane and you would program your enroute portion. maybe you would program your departure procedure and your approach procedure. But if you did those things, there would be potentially discontinuities in your flight path. And maybe your FMS will alert you to those discontinuities. A few systems actually do that. Many will just be happy to let you fly off, out over the ocean and never actually intersect your approach. And then while flying, air traffic control, and for other reasons, you may need to change altitudes, you may need to change headings, and that deviation from the flight plan is not managed by your FMS. So our FMS manages all of that for you, so you don't need to ever Disconnect the autopilot and hand fly the aircraft, we do it all. And we do that at a level of safety that far exceeds autopilots today. So our system on the ground now uses that exact same FMS. you're programming the aircraft, just like you would if you were in the plane using our system. What else is new? You also have a Traffic awareness, feature that's built in. So on top of our moving map, we plot traffic and our system provides certified or will one day be certified, today it's certifiable alerting and guidance, that maintains safe separation from other aircraft and will modify your flight plan for you. it also enables, voice communication to the aircraft. So there's a headset connected to our system and it works just like it does today. You dial in the frequency that you want to talk on. There's a push to talk button and your voice is streamed over satellite to the aircraft and then broadcast out the aircraft. So surrounding air traffic control, they hear you. Just the same way they would if you were sitting inside the plane. And conversely, you also hear everything just as if you were inside the plane. So we did it this way because, we're trying to do the simplest thing possible that can integrate into the existing airspace system. And I emphasize this because there's Folks out there that talk about, digitization of air traffic control, I think that's exciting. We're part of an RTCA group that's working on that, but I think that's a very long ways away. today The airspace works through charts, sectionals, AFDs, and people talking to people over amplitude modulated VHF. And so if you want to integrate UAS, that's the way you've got to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Robert, given that there's so much experience across the General Atomics platforms, the Northrop Grumman's and some of the others. if there was a solid business case in the commercial market, Wouldn't you expect those same players to service part 135 operators?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know how much of this is public. so I'll speak in generalities, but major military drone manufacturer you've heard of, I know, has attempted to market, the system to commercial players and has attempted to push, their aircraft through an FAA certification process. And I, I think the short story there is, it's hard. it is really hard to take something that was not designed with certification in mind and modify it to be certifiable. the Certification process, and not just the certification process, but the set of standards that the FAA has recognized, that should be used for certification, take your systems engineering all the way back to requirements. and if you don't have the evidence going all the way back to the very, very early days, mapping the requirements for your system and why everything is exactly the way it is and precisely how you have tested everything to ensure that it meets those requirements, it's hard to go back and do that after the fact, and for those that are listening that are familiar with DO 178 software, there's common stories in there about how you can't just take something from a prototype and then snap your fingers and make it certifiable software. It just doesn't work that way. So it's hard for these military manufacturers to make that transition. millions of flight hours does not a certification case make. You need to be able to hit factors of safety in the 10 to the minus 8, 10 to the minus 9 realm. That means the acceptable failure rate is, depending upon the size of aircraft, one in a hundred million hours of flight, or one in a billion hours of flight. You can't fly a plane for a billion hours and say, well, we only had one accident, therefore, it's certifiable. I'm not smart enough, but there's a RAND paper that goes into this too, that says that even a billion hours isn't sufficient to show one in a billion. You got to go way beyond that in order to get any kind of statistical\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, right. I guess where I'm going, Robert, is when we look at the Enabling technology blocks that exist on these platforms. And there's been some recent examples where, one of these big OEMs, have integrated into civilian airspace in the UK, they do have a certifiable platform. So what's different in your system approach? On a fundamental technology block that stands in contrast to the approaches that you're seeing by these and other players,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so you used a phrase there, fundamental technology block. And maybe I'll disappoint your listeners a little bit that I don't feel there's anything fundamentally different about what Reliable Robotics is doing from a technology perspective. What we're doing that's very different is our systems engineering approach. We are looking at this from day one with certification in mind, which means a thorough understanding of the regulatory construct for Highly automated aircraft and charting a path through the regulations, through existing published guidance by the FAA. Well, by the FAA, I was going to say and others, but we are nearly exclusively focused on the United States and building a system that complies with That set of regulations and guidance from day one. I think that's what makes us different. And when you approach it from that perspective, it leads you to make different technology decisions. for example, our air to air radar is not a military target tracking radar that consumes a tremendous amount of power, takes up a bunch of space and costs I don't know how much to manufacture. It's going to cost a lot less. it's going to meet exactly the requirements the FAA has, Published that they will accept for air to air radar for detect and avoid, through TSO C 211, 212, I believe, and nothing more. and that's going to result in a system that complies with those requirements right out of the gate and is probably an order of magnitude or more, less expensive than the systems that have been developed for military applications. I would also say the same on our communication system, our ground control station. Human factors is probably the biggest area in the FAA certification process where subjectivity creeps in, and that's where there are fewer standards to leverage, and what you really ultimately need to do is convince a number of subject matter experts in the FAA that the system does not Impose an undue burden on the pilot, and is consistent with human factors best practices, which change year to year, month to month, day to day. And that, that also needs to be designed from day one with a civilian aviation use case in mind. and that's where it's probably not a custom user interface that's point and click. it probably looks a lot more like the user interfaces that the FAA has accepted to date. and that's why our, design decisions track more towards a classic FMS and not something completely new.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so whenever somebody makes a safety argument, the bar is really high, obviously. So how can, anyone pursuing autonomous flight Reliable Robotics included, make a convincing case that what you are developing is safe in every conceivable condition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, this just goes back to what we were just talking about. The way you show a system is safe is you follow the published guidance, that the FAA and EASA have long accepted. There are standards. There are system engineering process standards that have been around for many years that are used to develop the Boeings, the Airbuses, the Embraers, the Part 25 aircraft of the world. And the way that you convince the FAA and thus the public that it is safe as you follow those same processes. I fundamentally disagree with folks that say because it's autonomous, because it's new, we need to invent new processes. That's completely bogus. We have processes to do this. It's just, it's a very hard, it's an arduous path. That's how you do it. That's how you get to 10 to the minus 8, 10 to the minus 9 and beyond.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we talked about the fact that, the military systems have not been able to prove it after millions and millions of flight hours. What's your view on the path to getting there? In terms of, data collection, time, whatever metric that you are using to track your progress along that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The metric that we use to track progress is how many regulations have we demonstrated compliance to so far? And there's processes for each. this is how certification works. You map out the regulations. you establish a certification basis, that says these are the regulations that are appropriate. You establish a means of compliance, an MOC. Fancy word, but just means how are you going to show that you meet the requirements. the, and then within each of that, there are processes. collect data, collecting data is a trigger phrase for me. You triggered me, it really irks me when people use that expression because I think, well, for what purpose? why are you collecting data? what system is this that you have where enough data on its functioning makes a safety argument? I'm not comfortable with a system where people say, well, because it worked for several thousand hours or because we did so many auto landings with it, it's safe. That's just bogus. That's not the way these processes work. That's how you get to 10 to the minus two. maybe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>obviously data is important. Obviously showing a track record is important when you talk to the regulator. how do you then view this challenge of proving to the regulator that in the absence of data\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>no, there is, I'm sorry. The collecting data is a trigger word for me because people talk about throwing their Autonomous plane up in the sky and building hours on it and collecting data so that they can further improve and modify the system. and then they, there's a double speak there where they often tie that to certification as if the FAA is going to say, Oh, you've flown 10, 000 hours, it must be safe. Okay, go for it. That's just irrelevant because it matters what it. You need to understand, like, well, what conditions did you operate the system in? did you just burn holes in the sky endlessly for 10, 000 hours? what were you really doing? I, we could take our plane and go burn holes in the sky over Mojave and perfectly clear weather with no other air traffic for 10, 000 hours, but what did we prove? Nothing. but\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it's configuration management. It is the right data logging. It's the right data management. obviously, it has to be structured in a way that resonates with the certification processes and all of the other applicable regulations. Absolutely. But, that's table stakes And so once that is understood, Talk about the development process, where you get comfortable and you get the regulators comfortable that you have achieved a certain, maturity level where you can field this to an aircraft and have confidence that whatever conditions they might encounter, the system will work and be safer than when the pilot is on board.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll go back and explain the certification process. There are hundreds of regulations that impact what we're doing. and each regulation has, Congress passes laws, FAA creates regulations that are, in compliance with those laws. The FAA then publishes guidance. on how they expect applicants, like us, developers of aircraft systems, to comply with those regulations. So within that, they publish guidance on, I'm trying to think of an example. regulation. says that automated landing systems need to be certified. and then they publish, an advisory circular that says, here's how we, the FAA, believe you need to demonstrate that you meet the regulation for an auto land system. And that, that one line regulation or paragraph may expand into a 700 page document. That 700 page document may reference other advisory circulars. It may reference industry standards. Maybe RTCA has published some guidance on how to tune a radio system that uses radio navigation for the purposes of auto landing and what the performance requirements of that system should be. This all expands out into thousands and thousands of pages. We actually summed all of this up, recently. we're well over, I think it's 27, 000 pages of documents, that we've brought into our system that are all FAA standards and publications and guidance that the FAA has put forward and blessed as applicable for Complying with the regulations. And these are just the ones that impact our system. There's actually much, much more in aviation more broadly. And so you have to dig into each of these standards and pieces of guidance that the FAA has published to get answers to questions like, well, how many hours is enough? Or how many flights is enough? How many landings is enough? In the vast majority of these cases, our certification approval that we received earlier this year, maps to about, I would say, 90 95% ish to things the FAA has already put out there. The stuff that doesn't match is dealt with in issue papers, and there, we've either proposed our own standards. We've said, hey, if we were you, FAA, this is the standard. And we just made it up. This is what we think the standard should be for this type of system. And we've gone back and forth with the FAA. It's taken many years, but we've gotten them to agree that's a reasonable standard for this thing. And now that's the standard that we're going to follow. In other cases, we've taken existing standards and we've proposed tailoring them. We've said, for example, the auto landing standard for Part 25 aircraft has a lot of really good stuff in it, and we're just going to leverage that, most of it, 98 percent of it, for Part 23. There's a few areas that we don't think are applicable to Part 23. Don't ask me off the top of my head what they are. we got the FAA to agree to that. Okay, so now you get into, let's take Autoland for example, I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but the Autoland set of standards, and this is hundreds of pages of documents that explain this, state that for you to get an automated landing system certified, you first have to build a very high fidelity simulation of your aircraft, and you have to show in simulation that the aircraft can hit essentially all possible, foreseeable, combinations of environmental conditions and aircraft configurations within whatever envelope you are intending to certify. So if we say that our system is good to 15 knots crosswind, then we need to show that for all density altitudes, and for all crosswinds, plus or minus 15, and all weight and balance configurations, and all aircraft configurations, and all possible, internal system failures that the aircraft could be experiencing, it will always bring the plane down to the ground within our performance window X feet laterally, Y feet, longitudinally, et cetera, and we're never going to exceed the G load limits of the aircraft. then you take the simulation, then you, from that, you say, okay, well, how do we verify that the simulation matches reality? And you have to choose test points in the real world that give you confidence that the sim is representative of the real aircraft. So you may want to pick the worst case aft CG configuration at the worst case density altitude at the worst case crosswind component, and then you have to go find a place in the United States to go do this. And that's why you go out to a place like Casper, Wyoming or whatever, and you stay out there for a couple of weeks until you hit that test point. And then you hit all your test points and say, okay, boom. Now, the simulation is good. We comply with all the Autoland requirements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in developing autonomous systems, you can broadly bucket into data, algorithm development, and testing, which one of those three do you see as the most challenging?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Say that again, algorithm development and what?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>broadly data, and in that it might be data collection, data annotation, warehousing management, so broadly the data bucket, then it's the algorithm development, and then it's the testing validation and verification. So if we can high level those three categories, where is your biggest focus now? what's the long pole in the tent? and where does a startup have an advantage over an incumbent?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>can I see what's behind door number four? I, I think, I wouldn't pick either of these. I would go to the certification basis, I think is the biggest challenge. And that's the area where a startup like us can have the biggest positive impact. And that's why we started the company. I don't think, I don't think collecting data is, a huge technical challenge. that's solvable. Algorithms, while complicated, are just algorithms, and that's just work. and the testing is just work. It just, it's something that you just have to do. the really hard part, the most challenging task in all of this is to figure out how the autonomy maps specifically to the regulations,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>while we're on the topic of Algos, can you talk about the software that's behind your autonomous features?

Most of us are pilots on the call. how much of the situations that one may encounter in flight do you feel that your software can be programmed to appropriately address?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If we can anticipate it, and this gets back to the processes that I was talking about earlier, there's a safety assurance process that's used in part 25 aircraft that we're using for the development of our system, where you enumerate all of the possible things you can imagine that will go wrong and you decide how will the system aircraft and pilot manage it and how to prevent a potentially hazardous or catastrophic outcome as a result. We're going through those exact same processes here. The difference is, we just don't have the pilot inside the aircraft to act as part of the system, if that makes sense. And it's hard. it's a lot more work when you don't have the human in the cockpit as the final node in your fault tree, to save the day and you don't get to defer the problem to training, then that means you need to implement an algorithm to, to solve it. And if we can imagine it, then we need to implement code or some feature of the system to mitigate that hazard. If you can imagine a hazard, we need to mitigate it. Period. That's how it works. Or we need to convince ourselves that it's like extremely improbable, like beyond 10 to the minus nine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>48:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>a lot of these, situations you cannot imagine ahead of time. So when is good enough, both good and enough, who makes that call? goes back to to how do you with authority stand in front of the operators, the people on the ground, the regulators, and say, we're good.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, maybe I'm not getting through. It's following the processes that the regulator has approved. That's how you do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So let's talk about cert, the processes, and if you don't mind explaining your certification path, and I'll just reference, one of your competitors, I think in 2021, petitioned the FAA for waivers for, a remote operation and was denied. how are you planning to avoid this situation? Can you give us a little bit more detail about your cert plans?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we don't intend to get in that situation. I am not surprised that their request was denied. there's a reason we have the certification process in the United States. And, I don't think they made a compelling enough argument to, short circuit that certification process. and so what we're intending to do is to follow the certification process. Our system is an STC that goes on top of the existing aircraft that's already type certificated, modifies it to enable remote piloting, and then the Part 135 air carrier certificate and the operation specifications associated with it need to be modified to support the STC. Much like today, if you have a 135 and you want to I don't know, fly CAT 2 ILS approaches, you have to write that into your OPS spec. You need to demonstrate to the FAA that you have sufficient training procedures to, teach your pilots how to run a CAT 2. they'll be the same kind of thing with our system where if you want to run our STC in your operation, you're going to have to write that into the OPS spec and you're going to have to coordinate with the FAA and get permission to do that. So for those of you unfamiliar with how airlines work, certifying an airline is just as complicated, if not more complicated, than certification of the on board equipment, the aircraft itself. the FAA gets very deep into how an airline runs itself, and the procedures that airlines use. There's a few obvious things like, pilot training that they get very deep into, because all airlines have chief pilots and chief pilots are responsible for, ensuring that everyone is sufficiently trained and there's standards that they need to follow. Safety management systems is another aspect that the FAA gets very deep into, and how, airline operators build and maintain safety culture is a big part of that. Maintenance is another obvious feature that the FAA gets very deep into.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right. Hey, Robert. so let's take a breath and let's go in a different direction here. Great discussion. How big is your addressable market today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, are we talking about today right now? Because I don't have a product yet. I don't have a certified\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>you had a product today. How big is the addressable market?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, our system is designed to be aircraft agnostic. And our intent is to take this STC, that we're first working on in the Caravan, and then modify it so that it can be put onto other aircraft. It'll be somewhat straightforward to do this for other Part 23 aircraft, a bit more complicated to do it for Part 25. But if we're including, Part 25, in your question, then the addressable market is huge. It's basically all of aviation. aviation is close to a, what, a trillion dollar industry now, drives four and a half percent ish of global GDP. and we think that we'll be able to access a very large portion of that. I should say to our business model, because I think this is important. is not just to provide the equipment. We don't want this to be a one time sale, but we're also providing all of the training and infrastructure necessary to install, deploy, maintain, and operate the autonomy as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are people willing to pay for today? And why? By market. And how much of it is safety driven? And if it's not safety driven, what's the key value proposition?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's safety driven. We were talking about that earlier.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Even 135 and 121, if there's a market with a 121 today, you're saying that the safety driven value is the number one driving need for autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's my position and I'm sticking to it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. And five years from now, you define the size of the market by the trillions of the size of the aviation market. But realistically, Let's say you're in front of a group of investors and they're thinking, is this a company, is this a space\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, you think I wasn't being realistic? All right, okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And if this is a space I want to invest in and this is a company I want to invest in, what are people willing to pay for in five years by market segment for autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>54:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most blunt way to put this that I think simplifies it, because yeah a trillion dollars, is a huge number. Let's see for your audience, let me decide how to answer this, because well, first, the most naive way to look at it is, okay, you're automating the aircraft. That's a function currently performed by the pilots. Well, what portion do, pilots contribute to the cost of aviation? And the answer to that is on part 25 aircrafts, it's close to 20 percent and on part 135, it's close to 30%. In some cases, it's 35 percent or more. A naive way to look at it is, okay, if all we do is reduce piloting costs, then it's 20 percent of the 800 something billion dollar, Part 121 world, which is a big number.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>54:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But Robert, it's not that autonomy would replace the pilot, it would just move it, right? There would be efficiencies in centralizing these pilot services so you can spread them around the network and make the network more efficient, that is for sure, but it wouldn't be a one for one replacement or removal of the pilot.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would think that autonomy is necessary for replacing the pilot in Part 121, but it's not sufficient. There are a lot of other things roles that the pilot is playing in the airline and in the operation of that flight, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, and I don't want to say that it diminishes that cost to zero, but it is a substantial reduction. some of that I think still needs to be tested, and we're working towards testing it as soon as we have our STC. We'll be able to, to go test out this and validate the unit economics, but it is a substantial, we are anticipating a substantial savings Right out of the gate. just by having the pilot sit in a control center, the effective utilization of that pilot goes way up. this is especially true in 135 operations, where, pilots typically fly less than two hours a day. And having them in a control center, they could fly a lot more. But then, that, I don't think that's looking deep enough that's, as I said, the naive way to look at it, the very, the oversimplification, where this gets quite a bit more nuanced, is when you look at how you can change the way your operations work, now that the pilot is in the control center. And the first thing there that we hear from operators that's most important to them is repositioning. Freeing the aircraft from the pilot, and this could even just be a completely empty plane that just needs to deadhead somewhere, a repositioning flight, would drive huge operational efficiencies. determining the value of this is complex. It depends on an operator to operator basis. But the feedback that we've received from many of them is that this is a substantial driver for them. The second is being able to, right size the aircraft, up gauge or down gauge. if you're remote piloting and you're flying an airplane that has a much more simplified interface, and the automation is taking care of all of the aircraft's specific details for you then, you don't necessarily need to be specifically trained, aircraft to aircraft. And so you can switch flying, one morning you might fly a Cessna Caravan, and then the next you might fly something like a Cessna SkyCourier. You can't do that today. It's not considered safe. It's not safe to have people trained up to fly multiple aircraft simultaneously and be jumping around back and forth because it's hard to maintain proficiency, across different aircraft types. maybe some pilots would disagree with me. I'm going to take that position, and there's many operators that take that position, even within, like, variations of the Airbus fleet. there's some operators I know, they will not let their 320 pilots that are trained to fly one avionics configuration fly the other because they don't consider it safe. So, remote piloting, you can now do that. and that, it also enables a huge amount of operational efficiency, being able to right size the aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what do you see as the time horizon for Reliable to be able to realize that vision? I want to tie back to Jim's question, on that five year time horizon, unlocking value for the company. You've been focused on the Caravan of which, roughly 3, 000 have been manufactured in its lifetime. a subset of those are in a type of operation that falls within your target market. But what does it take to expand the footprint of your product via STC into other platforms? How much time does that take? And does all of this happen within the time horizon that Jim laid out in his question, as we, we drill down from the top level market size down to the direct market that you can capture in five years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The key inflection point for us is, once we've got this system certified and operating on one aircraft type because of our focus on certification and the certification basis and all of the tools that we've developed to enable these, processes and analyses to be performed, don't anticipate it to take all that much time to transition the technology to subsequent aircraft. So I see an inflection point for us where once this is certified on one aircraft, boom, we can quickly scale to modify it and deploy it to other aircraft. So the time horizon question in my view gated or the critical path is on getting this very first system certified. That's the focus. so then you're going to ask me, well, when do you think that's going to happen? And it's hard to say. for all of the reasons we've been talking about previously, these systems engineering processes are very complicated and when you start digging into the details, you find things and it's hard to predict when you're going to be done. I can tell you when I'd like to be done. And I can tell you the dates that we have in mind, the team is tracking. but it's challenging to predict because nobody has ever done this before.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is your development path of a radar capability, is that on the critical path to what you're describing here?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The radar itself, the hardware, the software, the signal processing, no, the certification basis, yes, that is a component. I wouldn't say that's the, the biggest thing that's keeping me up at night, but it's certainly, it's a, an important component. The FAA has accepted, a set of standards for air to air radar. To my knowledge, nobody has yet driven that all the way through the certification process. We will likely be the first, and we're going to encounter things when we do that, and it's hard to predict how long it's going to take.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so when you, embarked on this project and you did the breakdown of, okay, well, are there ways that we can acquire this data? And I know that you have, done a lot of thinking on that. are there ways that we can lean on the supply chain to get a radar solution that meets our needs versus, what is the, time and investment and risk involved in developing our own? walk the audience through what those choices looked like and how you settled on this path?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, this is a recurring theme or nightmare of my career. we, we dealt with a lot of this at, previous companies that I'd worked at. you're trying to do something new. You're trying to put a product out in the world that nobody has ever done before. And you want to do it as quickly as you can. And so your mind goes immediately to, okay, who can we partner with? who can we get this component from? Radar was one where we had been trying for a very long time, to convince another set of developers, I won't mention any names, but companies you've heard of, to go build, a radar that meets our requirements, or rather meets the requirements the FAA has already published. And we've said, if you build this thing, we will buy it. And we've got customers, and this is how many units, you can expect us to purchase from you on this rough time horizon. And this has happened with us, with radars. It's happened, with actuators. It's happened with flight computers, with IO concentrator computers. It's happened with, our communication system. There's a couple of these key components that we didn't initially set out to build this ourselves, but we ended up deciding to bring it in house because we either, couldn't get anybody else to build it for us, period, we couldn't get anybody else to build it on a reasonable timeline, or we couldn't get anybody else to build it at a reasonable cost. And with the radar in particular, that was one where we went back and forth for a very long time, and eventually it just became clear that we're burning more time trying to convince this other group to go after this billion dollar market opportunity when we could just be spending this time building it ourselves. And at least then we build ourselves, when we encounter issues deploying it, which we inevitably will, it will at least be a misery of our own making.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So let's dig in on that project. what are the deficiencies that you are trying to address with this in house R&amp; D to build a radar that meets your needs? What are the gaps between what's available and what you want? And what do you see as the resources required to pull it off? Radar is not like a weekend project, right?

And so how do you look at that, risk versus reward profile?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first one realization was that radar, the components to build a more sophisticated radar have become more widely available in recent years. If we were having this conversation five years ago, I think you would be on much firmer ground to say that we're crazy. But now much of the signal processing technology, has become commoditized through deployment of global 5G networks. Antenna manufacturing is still, really tricky. and there are a few areas where we are still partnering, but, we're now the main integrator of the component. I'm not answering your question. You went to, What was the first part of your question again?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first part of the question was, the required resources and the gaps that you're trying to close between what's available in the market and what you need to have a radar solution that works in the National Airspace System for autonomous flight. And then what are the resources required to pull off that R&amp; D project and what is the, risk profile of that undertaking?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Roughly speaking, the air to air radar requirements for an autonomous aircraft, the reason you're putting a radar in there is to comply with 91.113 see and avoid requirements. And RTCA, a major standards body has been publishing, Minimum Operating Performance Standards for air to air radar systems for several years, the FAA has accepted, some of this work through, the TSO publications that they've put out. the requirements for those radar systems are largely a function of encounter speed, and within that, you have a range and resolution and tracking requirements, so you need to be able to see something at a certain range, you need to be able to infer its velocity at a certain amount of precision, and then you need to be able to track it, at some particular rate, and you need to be able to track a certain number of things, and you also need, a certain amount of visibility, vertically and horizontally. so those are the requirements. so this might be, I don't know, you might need to see out to 6 or 7 nautical miles, for example, and you may need to be able to see another aircraft that's moving 400 knots relative to you, for example. that then, it just goes to radar physics, and from radar physics, you conclude, okay, well, if we're going to use this radio frequency spectrum, then we need something this size and this power, and we need this many antenna elements, and then you go out to the market, now to answer your question, you look at, okay, who has a radar that meets these requirements, or is close, or could modify something to meet the requirements. In there, radar developers, fall into three buckets. you've got existing aviation certified radars that are designed for weather applications. those have incredible range, but the resolution and tracking is not sufficient. You've got military radars, which definitely have the range, definitely have the resolution and tracking capability, but they are tremendously expensive, they're huge, and they consume a lot of power. And it's hard to imagine how installation of some of those systems would be practical at scale on a Part 23 aircraft. And then you've got, sort of new entrant radar manufacturers that are using clever algorithms to do things at lower power with less, radar reflectivity information, and it's tricky to see how they modify those systems and scale them up, because they don't currently meet all of the requirements. And so that, that investigation led us down the path of, okay, let's try and convince one of these folks that are operating in the radar development space today to modify their system to meet the FAA's requirements. And that's ultimately what led us to where we are today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What technologies do you foresee being an important and necessary onboard part of an aircraft, as opposed to, being offered as a service? What do you think is the right combination for the mission that you are pursuing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think what you're question, getting at here, is what are the key technology components that are necessary to enable autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Especially in the context of detect and avoid, obviously you can have a radar onboard, which you are pursuing, but you can also, and you've had some experience, so maybe you can share some of the, insight with the audience here in terms of, asking for primary surveillance data from the FAA radar feeds. how do you think the market evolves around what ultimately gets equipped onboard versus what gets offered as a service. And then how does that change depending on the mission?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, I see what you're getting at. I think of the technology that enables autonomy in two different categories. Step one of autonomy is to have an autonomous aircraft. an aircraft that can manage itself through all phases of flight. The second thing you need is you need an airspace integration solution that integrates that autonomous aircraft into the system that we have today. And I see these as distinctly different things. Autonomy, or the airborne automation component, consists of all of the things that you would need to do automated taxi, takeoff landing. You need also a high reliability vehicle management system that can manage the fuel, circuit breakers, and all of the other subsystems that exist on aircraft, to keep the aircraft in a safe configuration. And now once you have that, once you have an aircraft that's capable of flying itself through all phases of flight, then it becomes a question of, okay, how do you integrate this into the airspace? And that's where you need to comply with 91.113 see and avoid requirements. And that's how you end up with the air to air radar. You need to communicate with air traffic control and surrounding aircraft. That's how you end up with the communication system. We have a dual redundant satellite communication system that we're working on certifying. And then finally, you need the ground control station, and to satisfy all of the human factors requirements associated with, with that interface.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>but specifically see and avoid, where do you see the, the market converging, onboard radars or, surveillance data that is provided as a service.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's actually long term it's going to be a fusion of many things, because air to air radar is good at certain things. Primary surveillance radar is good at other things. camera systems are good for other types of things. and so I think we'll see, a fusion. Our path that we're taking, now, and what we believe will first be accepted by the FAA for aircraft the size of the Caravan will be an air to air radar system, and that will meet the requirements and allow us to do operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can you tell us about your experience requesting primary surveillance data from the FAA?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, so primary surveillance radar, for those not familiar, these are radar systems that were initially put together by, a lot of them were built by the U S air force, for national security purposes. And then the data was released to the FAA for air traffic control purposes. They've since been augmented with transponder data feeds, and the combination of the primary radar with the transponder feeds, is frequently referred to as secondary surveillance radar. and the pictures of air traffic controllers, the screens that they're looking at is, is a terminal that shows you a fusion of primary and secondary, surveillance radar. Or frequently just secondary, but, they have the capability to see primary as well. Primary surveillance radar, in the United States, and there's some publications that the Air Force has put out there on this, is pretty incredible. There are very few places in U. S. airspace that are not covered by primary surveillance radar, and for the types of operations that we need to do with small cargo aircraft like the Caravan, it's possible to fly the Caravan and stay within primary surveillance airspace with sufficient margin to see all of the things around that aircraft. And we've shown through a variety of simulations. There was some work that we did with NASA several years ago on this. we've collaborated with some folks at MIT Lincoln Labs, on this as well. We've shown that you can actually use primary surveillance radar to solve see and avoid in certain airspaces in the U. S., not all, but in many of the ones that are economically relevant for our use case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Robert, does that account for the, the update frequency of primary surveillance radar and the latency in getting that data to the aircraft?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it's really a function, too, of, well, how it gets back to what I was talking earlier, about air to air radar requirements. it matters what air speeds do you expect to see encounters and how much separation buffer do you want the system to have. And so in areas where the update rate and resolution is lower, it just means you need to fly further away from other things that the radar picks up in order to maintain sufficient margins.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the update rate?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That I don't know off the top of my head.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, what's the likelihood you would get access to primary radar in the next couple of years at scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, so we actually had access many years ago. I think we talked about this in that article in The Air Current. and that was partly how we demonstrated the efficacy of PSR for solving this problem. and then we went to go do another set of test demonstrations and our access was revoked and the message that we got back was that too many other groups had taken notice of what we did. Word got out and so a lot of other people started requesting access and then somebody raised the specter of national security.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>without a doubt. it took 20 years for secondary radar information to be provided to the public. I can't imagine what it's going to take for primary radar data to be released. Again, at scale. testing is one thing, but at scale is another.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:14:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But we anticipated this and I, let me, I don't want to let that drop. We care about national security. I care about national security too. We anticipated this and we proposed a number of processes that the FAA and the DoD could use to secure the data. We even went so far as to, suggests that the data only be accessed within locked facilities that are access controlled and follow a variety of NIST standards for cybersecurity and none of that was accepted. And my understanding is, the FAA is continuing to look at this. They are making progress with the DOD on how to release the data. I've even had executives in the FAA tell me that they think it is in the interest of national security to release the data because if they don't, then it means private companies, potentially foreign owned private companies, might stand up their own radar networks and have better surveillance in the airspace than the United States government does.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stand up their own primary radar within the United States, foreign governments?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Foreign owned companies may do this, and I would say that there are private companies today that already have stood up their own radar systems at airports.

We started this airline. We view it as an incubator and this gets to what we were talking about earlier with the certification of the airborne component and modifying the Ops spec for the airline. We decided to bring that portion of it in house so that we can modify the OpsSpec ourselves first in a very small airline, relatively small airline, I should say. And once we figure out how to do this and get the FAA to approve it, our intention is to then license it out so that other airlines can benefit from it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what do you see as the optimal position to occupy along the value chain? What are the pros and cons for each? Whether you're an OEM, an operator, an avionics supplier, an airframer, in this world of autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:17:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think there's places for everybody to, to get wins. OEMs are going to benefit because autonomous versions of the aircraft are going to sell much more than other versions. Maintenance providers, FBOs, are going to benefit because there'll be different maintenance challenges. We were talking earlier about ground handling complexities with remote piloting and how we're going to figure all that out. And fixed base operators and others are going to benefit from that. Component suppliers are going to benefit by pushing the technology out. Airlines, obviously, are going to benefit through operational efficiencies. Where we see ourselves fitting in is we want to provide a few of the core components, not all, but a few of the core pieces of equipment, and we want to provide the certification services to get the equipment put into use. And I'm talking about the airborne component as well as the Airline operations component. And then there will also need to be ongoing, services, communication services, as well as detect and avoid and other cloud based, aircraft management components that you'll need in order to be able to run this technology at scale. And I think that's an area where, we'll be able to provide value for our customers too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:18:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, do you see companies that are building autonomous flight technology in the small UAS space entering this value chain and being a player in the coming years? On the one hand, they are developing very rapidly. They're able to do tighter iterations. They're able to fly a lot more hours. On the other hand, they're, building their innovations in a different airspace regime, below 400 feet, different requirements for that. But I think one could argue that some of the technologies that are being matured there are advancing very rapidly and, have relevance in the rest of the airspace system. So when you look out ahead, where do you see those manifesting in the value chain?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:19:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I'd go back to what we were talking earlier about military UAS and applicability. I'd give you almost the same answer. in order to meet the certification requirements, the regulatory requirements, you've got to take it all the way back, to the beginning. And while I'm sure there are lessons being learned in the small UAS space and, we're benefiting from work that's been done there, early work with Beyond Visual Line of Sight, the core components and the regulatory basis, I don't see that carrying forward. It'd be like saying an autonomous fork truck in a warehouse is going to turn into a self driving car. Sure, like, there's aspects of it that we'll carry over, but it's just a very different design domain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:20:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you don't see potential of the safety case and the data built up in that domain being extended into other types of flight or other parts of the airspace system, that's really just not going to be a factor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:20:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I hate to give you a firm no, because there may be an element to this that I'm missing, but, I, I struggle drawing a straight line between the two. the Part 107, uh, 44807 exemption space, It's just very different from part 23 aircraft and part 25 aircraft.

I don't think that's going to be a problem. However, I would pivot slightly on the technology that I really think that certification is the challenge. Certification is the challenge. We need the FAA to do this. This takes a massive public private partnership, and, I know I'm the one you're speaking with, but, and I'm representing Reliable Robotics, but I also feel like, the FAA has a big role to play here. And it's of crucial importance that Americans especially take note of this and inform members of Congress that the FAA needs support to do this. If we want the United States to continue to be a leader in aviation, we need to be putting more resources into the FAA.

Welcome back to The Vertical Space and our discussion with Dr. Yemaya Bordain as president of the Americas of Daedalean. From right out of the gate, Yemaya challenges, much of today's established thinking. Listen to what she says is an area where very few in the industry agree with her on. And where she questions the near term economic viability of the UAM model. And that she believes level four autonomy is needed for UAM economic viability. And listen to later in the podcast, when she believes level four, autonomy may come about. Those investing in UAM should pay close attention to Yemaya's comments. We first discuss the history of automation. The why of automation on a segment by segment basis. What has and what will drive the need and how does it scale? Followed closely by a detailed discussion on the levels of automation and the value of each. As well, as in what market the Daedalean is spending most of their time today and why. And how safety improvements are the biggest near term opportunities in this market. Listen to Yemaya's first discussion with operators on autonomy, particularly commercial operators. What's also interesting is the role or lack of a role for AI at the different levels of automation? Next is a detailed discussion on the future of avionics, starting with discussion of Yemaya's white paper. We enter into a detailed discussion on why AI needs multi-core processors and the difficulty of certifying MCPs. And listen to Yemaya's response to Luka's question on whether or not there can be a generalized approach to certifying MCPs and how Yemaya thinks that autonomy and certification of AI in MCPs will change the existing value chain in avionics. She also discusses the levels of automation where Daedalean will be generated revenue and what markets including AAM over the next 10 plus years. Her summary at the end of the discussion is inspiring. Yemaya, thank you for joining us and to our listeners, enjoy this terrific discussion with Dr. Yemaya Bordain as you innovate and The Vertical Space. Dr. Yemaya Yemaya Bordain joined to Daedalean in October, 2022, as president of the Americas to lead innovation, flight testing, and partnerships. Previously, she spent seven years at Intel developing industry, leading to advances in partnerships with top global OEMs, including Lockheed Martin corporation, Collins Aerospace, Indra systems, and Mercury Systems. She earned her BS in electrical engineering and MS in Computer Science at Clark Atlanta at University and a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, welcome to The Vertical Space.

So let's start with the one thing that very few in the industry agree with you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lately, I've been going to and even speaking at some of these Urban Air Mobility, conferences and I think that there's a business case, problem that, Urban Air Mobility has particularly for people carrying, operating cost, the cost of total ownership, the cost of the airframes, less range, slower, and carrying people, especially when they need to carry luggage, I just think that there, there should be some, analyses that is less optimistic than some of them that I've seen recently and, more feasible and truly take into account, how the airspace is operated today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. so the need for high levels of autonomy to scale is what you'd like to underline in this viewpoint, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, the economic viability in, our minds, it doesn't happen until one is able to scale and automation, autonomy, these will address the operating cost significantly and enable that scale. And so we believe that we don't see economic viability until at least what we call like a level four, autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interesting. let's set the stage, understanding that aviation has a rich history in automation from a hundred years plus. And so describe to us the evolution of automation in aviation from its very early days to today and how we think about autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh man, great question. I guess when we think about it in terms of that, automation and autonomy could potentially be its own scale, in relative scale versus absolute scale. I'm certain that, Sperry's gyroscope, seemed like a huge, device that drove automation. and it came only, what, six years after the Wright Brothers, flew, right? some other huge advancements included Fly by Wire, enabling, pilots. to fly the aircraft through a computer. that, that was huge, right? And in fact, one of my favorite technical papers that exists is, the, fly by wire system architecture that was published on the A320. It's, it honestly, it's actually what taught me how, important flight safety is and how people design safe systems. And then, finally today, autonomy looks like everything, being Digital, all pilot tasks moving toward being taken over by, ultimately silicon plus algorithms.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, historically, the introduction of, automation in flight. as I describe it, was initially because of the expansion of the envelope of the aircraft. aircraft became, faster, they flew higher, they flew farther. So there was a need to alleviate the pilot mechanically from, the stick and rudder skills. And it was much more difficult with these higher dynamic loads to move the control surfaces and therefore increasing level of automation. And then, I guess another phase could be the use of automation to reduce the cognitive load of the pilot to then, paint a better situational awareness picture or just operate more efficiently and safely in the increasingly, busy airspaces and complex scenarios. And so what about now? What is this? Is this a scale? the next frontier that introduces this new wave of automation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Luka, you mean in terms of the motivation for, why are we pursuing this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. this arc of introducing various degrees and kinds of automation and what is really the motivation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think you're right on with scale, accessibility, cost. In today's, general aviation market, it's, safety enhancements. general aviation has so much headroom for safety and automation can enable, GA to enjoy the safety levels that are available to the commercial market. I do believe that it's driven by cost, it's driven by scale, it's driven by, people wanting more accessibility. It's driven by our world, being more connected and requiring, being able to, engage a lot faster, right? There used to be email and, You could expect that someone would respond to your email within two days or then within a day. Now you just text people, right? So I think a lot of the driving forces behind it is really, along the lines of the trends of society today, mostly driven by scale and cost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Peter, since you asked, what jumps to mind to you when we introduce this arc and this motivation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think it's really interesting to look across the segments of aviation and, okay, number one, you look at the opportunity to automate, and then number two, you look at, well, what differential does it deliver and let's say in commercial aviation, it is, It's exceptionally safe today, it has a level of automation but it's not the type of automation that we're looking ahead to, nor is it, a level of automation that you would describe as autonomous behavior. but in that segment, there is, a lot of resistance to, bringing in high levels of autonomous flight, reducing cockpit crew from two to one. there are a lot of motivations that people are pursuing it, but there's a lot of resistance to doing that. in other parts of aviation, you have a different landscape. You do have a safety opportunity, but you might have, a different customer profile. Where I think it's really interesting is some segments of aviation, UAS, they're physically so small that putting a human on board to operate it is just, fundamentally not an option. This is a 40 pound air vehicle. And so in those segments, you have an incredibly high motivation to, bring the level of automation up to whatever is required for the mission, call it autonomous flight in some cases, if you want, because that's what makes the, mission possible. and in some of these segments, as you highlight, making that mission possible is world changing. It will change our perception of how we think about moving things around the world, how we think about the time and space around us. given all these different, segments of aviation, they share some technological similarities, they might be operating a different scale, it might be a different mission profile, but there's a lot of commonality in the technology that pulls this off, that allows us to achieve this vision and looking at it through that lens is what... has me so interested in this question of motivation because like everybody, I just took it for granted that of course we want autonomous flight. It's a new technological horizon. Let's go and build it. But then in conversations with people in industry, it struck me like, wait, let's take a step back and think about what is the real motivation and which segment of aviation is the path of least resistance to build up the technology, to build up the operational experience, that kind of organizational muscle, to then really realize the vision. And maybe it propagates from there, but where do you start?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so I, to address What you stated, it's such a good point. by training, I'm an engineer and I absolutely positively nerd out on new technology, and I find that much of the industry does that as well. And so your point of course we want automation. Of course we want autonomy. I initially geeked out about that as an engineer and just, this is so cool. We totally should do this. And it was after the fact that I challenged myself and my team to dig into why do you want autonomy? What does automation and autonomy deliver? And that's when we were able to, realize or, reveal that we want enhanced safety. We think that this can reduce labor cost. we think that this can enable the optimization of crew, it can streamline operations, potentially even, lead to simpler maintenance, fuel and energy consumption. We just, we realized that we wanted to focus more on the why of automation and autonomy, and of course, be pioneers of how we get there as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yamaya, it's interesting. you proud yourself on being a problem solver. I've read a lot about you and I've seen you in interviews and we're talking about the foundation of why autonomy, but the reason you say some people may not agree with you is that you're saying that the advanced air mobility passenger carrying world won't be viable without what you're claiming to be fully autonomous, which is, four out of the five stages. So you're saying that the very business proposition of AAM won't be viable without autonomy. So that's a pretty darn good reason. A lot of us agree with you on that. And so if we need a motivation... For autonomy and advanced air mobility, this is one of them, because even the public companies are saying that we can be profitable, but for them to be able to meet their financial projections, some level of autonomy, you call it fully automated automation, as\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>automation. Yeah,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You're saying that has to be achieved. So what a motivation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that you can only get there when you sit down and start talking to operators. and in particular, you start talking to today's civil airspace, those operators. I remember having, meetings with a very large operator and, I was so focused on how cool the technology was. And, this is when I started at, Daedalean, I was so focused on how cool the technology was that I just assumed that he got it when I said automated or autonomous. And I didn't get the same kind of excitement from him that I expected. And I took him to the side and I said, Hey, can you give me, very direct feedback? Why weren't you so excited? And he said, well, one, I don't think that automation or autonomy is going to happen for next decade. that makes you not very useful to me, right now in, in what you're providing, if you're leading with that. but secondly, he said, Yemaya, we are not, a risk environment. We, are margin constrained and. It was like, Oh, right and so what I realized is that we need to solve the problem. We're problem solvers, each one of us, even, the engineers. I was trying to solve a technological problem, but we're really supposed to be solving an operational problem. And that operational problem is an economic viability issue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. we had, several guests in the course of the podcast series where we discussed autonomy and it's always interesting to hear their thoughts on the reasons why autonomy, we talked a little bit about this now over the last several minutes, but I think it's worthwhile hovering a little bit more and going to a bit more detail, perhaps on a segment by segment basis, commercial, airline operations, part 121 operations general aviation, UAS, all of the other segments. And describe what are some of the common misconceptions in terms of the reasons for autonomy, versus what you think autonomy is helpful for, right? what's in the back of my mind is a conversation that we had with, Brian, Yutko from, Wisk, and on that topic, he mentioned that, a common misconception is that people tend to drive their economics discussion around autonomy in terms of the removal of the cost of the pilot in the operation, whereas he says, no, that's totally not the point. The point is in a better management of an asset, from a network perspective and being able to reposition those assets and separate the human operator from the actual vehicle and how that opens up the, operational freedom and the network design freedom, which totally makes sense and similarly, there are. misconceptions around safety where people jump to the conclusion that, removing the pilot will automatically result in safety. So give us your thoughts around this. It's a kind of long way of saying, let's go a layer deeper into why autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I, absolutely positively agree with Brian. We also are not driving toward removal, or, nor do we think that in, in every, application, the removal of a pilot is the best thing. And in fact, when we deliver talks and talk about the levels of, autonomy, we've started looking at those in terms of Search and Rescue, there's, Offshore Oil, Transport. There is, Law Enforcement and Surveillance. We, there's HEMS, there are many that we said, yeah, these could be along the spectrum. of, automation, but they're not appropriate for full automation and full autonomy. And, we define the difference between the two of those, as full automation the aircraft is, self separate, but there is a human in the loop. who is monitoring, the decisions that are being made and then for full autonomy, there's no human in the loop. This thing just runs, by itself uninterrupted and unmonitored. And, so for that reason, we think that it is a common misconception that saying that you want to, develop autonomous or automated systems means that you want a world where there are no pilots. it's quite the opposite. We want pilots to, be managing the decisions, the processes, that are reserved only for humans that's where we think that, it continues to be in, especially in very, dynamic and, environments that are changing quite a bit. And even in those, we talk about that a bit as well of when should you use AI versus not AI and where there are benefits. But, we want to augment pilots, we want to support pilots, we want to lower the pilot workload, we want to enable operators to scale, we want to address the cost by using, resources a lot more efficiently.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you looked across, those different operations and CONOPS, on the one hand you look at the ultimate manifestation of autonomous flight and you say, okay, well, where does this really fit in? And maybe it's transoceanic cargo as you mentioned, did the stepping stones to get there also surface from all of those conversations where you see, hey, okay, here's the state of the art today. And if we push one step further, what is a sensible application for that where we could, deploy it, build up experience with it and have a marketable. solution out there. did the path to get there, surface from those conversations? And I'd love to get your thoughts on what that looks like, whether we really need AI or not in order to go down that path. what did that look like? what emerged from that\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. We looked at these different CONOPS. we approached it in a few different ways. We looked at the, segments, the market segments within aerospace and, not including defense. we don't, support defense applications as a company. and we looked at GA, we looked at commercial, we looked at even, UAS and we looked at UAM, it as its own kind of use cases or segment as well. because we do think that it in the way that it will, be developed, it'll be, a pretty unique, use case or a pretty unique segment. we looked at those and we segmented them in margin versus volume. We, also looked at, the, pilot tasks that can be automated, as you go along. So for instance, being able to detect obstacles or other, aircraft, in the airspace. and we looked at it in, in ConOps and what we were trying to get to, is where automation and autonomy could address, a segment that, is currently high revenue generating, even if it's not high margin, because the costs are so extreme, or the costs are just, they're prohibitive, put it that way. and we thought through some of those applications and then we dug more into those and what parts of that if we were to, automate certain tasks or automate, certain parts of, these operations, what, how could we get a bigger bang for our buck, in order to enable, these things to scale? We also, took some applications that we think probably would fall under kind of lower automation, say for instance, Search and Rescue, where, you know, the environments are really dynamic and the mission itself is dictating, say, the navigation, of the airframe, right? And in those cases, we thought that, okay, how can we support the pilot workload, the pilot that is, flying, but then there's the, operator that's managing the mission, right? That's basically telling the pilot, go here, go there. So we thought about that as well. And we said, look, we just don't think that there is a huge opportunity here, but there are definitely some specific tasks and areas where, we can assist the pilot. And so we thought through that as a spectrum and we went through tens of CONOPS in order to rank them along, different scales.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You have mentioned level four and level five automation. do you mind just mentioning the five just for our audience? Because it's cool how you refer to CONOPS and levels of automation, but if you could just, go from assistance to partial automation to highly automated, just briefly define them for our audience. And then as you refer to from level one to level five, they'll have a sense for you, what you mean by, for example, even where's the low hanging fruit for automation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. Level one, human has, full responsibility. And this is just for task assistance. So the AI, Pilot Not Flying or, AI Co Pilot. Sometimes we call it AI Co Pilot. Sometimes we call it Pilot Not Flying or Pilot Monitoring it provides just assistance to the pilot for, situational awareness. And the AI provides... situational intelligence. So this is the ability for the pilot to not only understand the current situation, but also to be able to predict the future and anticipate, any potential problems in the future. So what humans do today with semantic understanding is that we paint a picture and we're able to identify threats that could happen in one second, five seconds, 10 seconds. That's what the AI brings. And in this case, we are just providing the pilot with task assistance. and our first product, PilotEye is a great example of this. PilotEye is a traffic advisory system that uses, camera inputs and neural networks to draw a box around anything else that's in the airspace. And, what is the value proposition there? Well, when you're using cameras and neural networks, we identify non cooperative traffic. We identify birds and drones and paragliders and, hot air balloons, right? And the point is not necessarily to say this is exactly where it is, but the system, it provides that input to say, look up. There's something there, and we, we want your attention here because we see something there that is not, going to be identified, through a transponder.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Yemaya, what segment of the market are you targeting with Pilot Eye?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, PilotEye is, GA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>that's interesting because as we were discussing earlier, GA is the segment where, safety is a concern more than for other segments of the market. But at the same time, it is a segment that doesn't really have a high willingness to pay for new technology. So how have you thought through the business case. How do you articulate value?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Oh my gosh. That is such a great question because this is the, it's the ongoing question, right? And sometimes it's even, what divides your BD team from your engineering team? Because engineers want to do cool stuff. and engineers want to develop the best of the best and we have to remind our teams that, Hey, just to let you know, right, these things need to sell for 15K, 20K, right, 30K.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. And at the same time, the community is struggling to sell 500 transponders,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. Absolutely. this is where that analysis that I spoke of earlier, where we assess the market along ConOps, but also along, the high revenue generating, ConOps and applications because there is a bit more flexibility in those markets and then we drive toward there. And there are some applications where. I've had conversations with, operators and they've stated, yes, we won't pay, I'm making it up, a hundred K for this, but definitely the cost benefit justifies, us paying more for this because this is a real threat for operations and it could lead to loss of airframe, which in that case, then you're talking about millions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>PilotEye has applications for Level 1 automation, which is the category of assistance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Level two. What about\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Level 2 partial automation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Level two. Human pilot still has full responsibility. the AI pilot not flying, provides assistance and forecasting risk in offering mitigation. Again, this could be something where, the, the system not only, identifies that the traffic is there, but it also could say that, there is a bird there and you are on, a direct collision course and it could offer mitigation in, for instance, providing a maneuver. So this could be like a TCAS2. if we, plug this into closed loop with, TCAS2, that, that provides some mitigation. Level 3.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If I may real quick, yeah, I'm assuming Captain Sullenberger would have, that would have been extraordinarily valuable in this situation where if he could have been notified, I think there were Canadian geese that around this certain direction. I'm not sure what he could have done different. Luka could probably could answer that better than me, but I would assume with that kind of capability in a commercial aircraft, would be a big deal where there's a lot of birds and obviously that had near catastrophic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that's why, as we're introducing PilotEye, that's why many get it. One operator that we met, he'd been flying helicopters basically his entire life because he learned, to fly from his dad. And he said while he was in, fixed wing training that he almost hit a bird and he, I think he said that he dove and he said, if I had your system during that time, he said, I thought I was going to die. And I could have died. I wish that your system was available to us at that time and, for the same reason, we think that you're right we can't say what could have happened, if Captain Sully had a system like ours, but we would love to believe that our system could have made, a difference in, the impact in the first place.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, can we quickly climb through the ladder and get through level five and then we'll get into the topic of, certifying these systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. level three, automated, autonomy, or automation, rather. the human pilot, it's either remote or on board, and it's still responsible for the decision making and execution of the system. And the AI, pilot monitoring provides, full guidance and, while the pilot still remains fully responsible. And this could be a system that, identifies a runway and then provides full guidance all the way down, to a safe landing. Level 4 is fully automated. In this case, the human pilot, is remote and supervises all of the AI decisions. And, the AI co pilot, is promoted to the pilot flying while there is a human pilot that is supervising and, can always interject if a wrong decision was made, but in this case, the airframe, the aircraft is self separate in, in the air. And then finally, Level 5 is what we call autonomous, that's the difference between fully automated and autonomous, and that's where there's no human and the, the AI pilot flying, has full authority.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What would be very cool to know, we're going to talk about certification here in a second, what would be very cool to know is what's the total available market, now, three years from now, five years from now, ten years from now, by level. you don't need to answer it now, but would be interesting is, my guess is four and five are near zero today. and then by level what's the available market for your technology with its application of AI, that would be interesting to know, you don't need to answer it now. Maybe at the end of the podcast or, maybe at another time to see what these opportunities are, in\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's great. Our team is going to go back and definitely take a look at, from that perspective. I love it. That's a great way to slice this as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in preparation of the podcast, we've read your white paper with Intel, I think it was earlier this year, on the future of avionics. and there were some really interesting points that, I'd love to uncover in a bit more detail here. the paper outlines, really two main challenges around the future avionics. One is the software assurance problem for AI and for neural networks, and in this case for Pilot Eye with the use of neural networks and computer vision, And then the second one as these neural networks require really higher levels of computational resources, necessity to use multi core processors in avionics. two really fascinating topics for us. So let's start with the first one or actually you pick, but let's uncover both of these angles in some level of detail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. now we're getting into my passion and where I start to nerd out because by training, I am a, Silicon Person. My doctorate is in electrical and computer engineering I did atomic force microscopy looking at, individual, transistors and how, electrons and photons, I'm sorry, electrons and,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I like that. Infotants.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How they move through individual gates. And so this is really cool. I was at Intel for, what? Seven years before going to Daedalean. And I actually met Daedalean, in my work at Intel in driving, multicore adoption to higher DAL levels in the avionics space. So I love this topic of processing and how to, compute massive amounts of data, on systems that have to meet the size weight and power constraints of gravity. This is, again, on, this, idea of high performance computing, this is where gravity becomes a big challenge. and so I've spent, years trying to support and solve this problem. The challenge with, artificial intelligence is, again, it requires a lot of processing, resources that for certification or systems that needed to be certified, systems that were safety critical systems, it's pretty unprecedented to require this much performance. And, for instance, flight control systems don't require a whole lot. but, when you're working with a lot of data and you're needing to process a lot of data very quickly, particularly that are coming from, image frames, it becomes quite challenging. So this was a problem that Daedalean did not set out to solve when the company was founded in 2016, our co founders were fully intent on solving the software problem. And, that software problem is really around how do we ensure software assurance when it's a machine learned system, and you're running machine learned algorithms. And Daedalian worked with the EASA and published the first guidance or theory on an approach on how to certify machine learning and found that, some of the differences is in, say, Software Assurance, Code Traceability is really huge. Well, when it's a machine learned system, data traceability is just as, or even more important, for those systems. And, we co published with the EASA, a series of papers, CODAN, Concepts of Design Assurance for Neural Networks. And this was the first guidance on how to manage machine learning systems. And we found that really the focus should be on the data management, data verification, ensuring that, your learning process is managed extremely well and, with high assurance and the way you train your models, all these things in, verifying that there's a, the learning process verification. There's the, model implementation. These are all along this process of assuring what we coined with the EASA in this, in these papers, learning assurance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can we talk about learning assurance a little bit more? Because even from the white paper, it left me, wishing for more, especially how you decompose the system level requirements into ultimately data sets, the algorithms, how you create these, offline, independent, annotated data sets. Tell us a little bit more about that particular aspect, how you run this learning assurance and, reach a level that is, by your own judgment, similar to software assurance for running a DO 178 project, for instance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah. we, we said if I were to summarize what CODAN says, it essentially said that we want to ensure that the data that you train on is representative to your operating environment. And everything from there was how do you ensure that happens? And you have to get a ton, collect a ton of data, right? So we have to be basically constantly flying in order to collect, as much data, as we possibly can. You have to ensure that you have some processes and structures around, how you annotate that data. you have to ensure, that you, are managing the training of that, and the implementation, the verification and implementation, very tightly. And this idea of generalization or, ensuring that your data that you train and how you manage that data is representative of the real world. That is probably where the secret sauce is that we did not publish. And, the question, would remain, well, how much data do I need in order to get there? CODAN is really about the process in that way. It's very much so DO 254, DO 178C, right? It's really about the process, right? And operating in a very processed way, making sure that you have traceability, making sure that you are, clearly identifying and, describing your requirements, and that those requirements can be tested, right? And that, you're not using your training data on your testing set or the other way around, right? To make sure, that you're not over training. And so in, the CODAN paper and that approach, is very much guidance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What can you tell us about this generalization and this data collection in a way that represents the actual real world environments? We'd love to learn a little bit more about that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'll give an example. Let's take PilotEye for an example. for PilotEye, we say that we want our system to be able to identify, traffic and, draw a, a box around it. and, in that case, your training data needs to be, a whole lot of data where you are seeing traffic. And where, you want to ensure that your requirements are well constrained. We start out on PilotEye in, daytime VFR. Right. And so that's, more about, well, then when the system goes into operation, we don't have performance guarantees on it at night because it's been designed and the process that we went through in our requirements, in our performance guarantees were around operations and daytime VFR. So that's one example of, how. We walked through, ensuring generalization, again, the secret sauce, and because we are currently, as far as we know, and even what EASA has stated publicly, we're the only company that is, in this process, we had stages of involvement, or SOI audit with the EASA, a few months ago, and that was the first time that had been done. It was a historic, event for us and for the EASA. we're learning along the way of how you actually prove that. that is another one where proving it is, the trade secret. And, that's something that we do plan to publish once we get certified.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was just about to ask you that question, so I'm glad you brought it up. as I see it, perhaps there's two kind of sub discussions in this topic. one part of the conversation is addressing the non determinism of the systems. And, perhaps from your perspective, it's unfair to say that it's non deterministic, even though it's not a line by line kind of determinism it still doesn't produce a random result. There is still some kind of, probabilistic, obviously, but in inferring the function that takes the input to the desired output, even though it's not as transparent as line of code, it's still not random. So you can argue that there is some, I won't call it determinism in the DO 178 sense, but, there is some comfort there. But I think the more difficult question, is how do you actually prove that you can achieve safety, and established safety in all of the possible conditions that you can find yourself in. I think that's a much more difficult problem to do, correct? How do you view these two different arguments, and what's the latest regulatory thinking on it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, taking for a moment, taking certification out, just in, in software development and software engineering, Determinism is some given input, being operated on by a given operator I have the same output, even by the way, if that output is wrong every single time, but if it is exactly the same every single time, it is by definition a deterministic system, right? And that's what we're trying to get to. We're showing that, if in the way that we treat the data and in achieving generalization. That for given set of inputs, and that set of inputs is well defined in the requirements that, running through our model, we always will get the output, meaning that it'll be identified, say for a pilot eye, as an example. And so that means that we have to be clear and sure, on the where and what conditions it should be, operated. And again, if it's designed for daytime VFR, yes, it turns out that we've actually had some folks that have tested, our system at night and they're like, it works great at night. Well, that is great for us, but still, in getting certified, those performance guarantees are for very specific conditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so what stands in the way from having some of these frameworks for certifying ML based software be accepted as a means of compliance? What are the main remaining concerns that EASA, FAA, and other regulators around the world have?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The EASA is a bit further along, seemingly at least, with CODAN on how to treat, machine learning systems. I think one challenge and the bigger one that comes to mind right now is just in, having a harmonized approach. And our company is working, pretty closely, in order to drive towards some harmonized approach. Keep in mind that, PilotEye is currently in a process. And it's in a process through the FAA with concurrent validation with the EASA. And we gotta answer some of these questions as we're in the process, and I think we are. this process has been one that, from our perspective, we are we're thrilled, in it. Not saying that, any one of the agencies are, being progressive in any way, that definitely is not the case. however, one thing that we've noticed is that the agencies are really digging in and for instance, through CODAN, the coauthors on the EASA side, they previously had no experience with machine learning and they dug in, they got statistics, they dug into really understanding what is happening here so that they could provide some guidance, that, could support the overall objective of, providing some guidance for acceptable means of compliance. And so I gotta give kudos to both agencies because, they are learning and they are asking us a lot of questions and they are challenging us. And, they are, as we, drive toward this, this development and this effort, we are finding, that everyone wants to ensure that we do the right thing,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>other than harmonization, what are some of the ways that they challenge you? What are some of the questions that they raised?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, some of the questions, I'll say, Alright, one, one is, our CEO, Luuk, he has published a series of, blogs and blog posts and a video on explainability. And, so this is one area where, our approach and our, thoughts on explainability there could potentially be at least some areas where this, there's, some misalignment, and, so that's one of the areas where we're like, okay, what does that mean? And even if we have, a different approach or, We don't value that approach as much what does that mean for this project? And essentially, what do we have to do in order to prove explainability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in terms of accumulating enough data to represent the real world environment, what's the role of synthetic data in this process?

Startups have been phenomenal for driving the innovation that will transform aerospace. I really do believe that. I think startups have some risk, many have some risk of, not remaining super focused on their core IP. and, I see a lot more, vertical integration with, startups than you would for the more traditional aerospace market that it has been moving directly in the opposite direction for the last 10 or 15 years, right? in the broader aerospace market, open systems is everything. The United States DoD, they, at some point, they got sick of, the large air framers, I won't call any names, but the large air framers charging them insane amounts of, money just to change out a chip because For instance, it was something that it was an ASIC and it wasn't commercially available. It wasn't commercial off the shelf. So this, idea of vertical integration, there are parts of it that can be, a distraction for some startups that are, developing airframes. And I think that, your time to market is really important. you don't get credit for efficiency, you get credit for delivery focusing so much on your core IP and making sure that you're better than anyone else in the entire world on your core IP and outsourcing basically everything else when it is feasible and when it's viable, and leveraging the existing ecosystem. I believe those are the folks that are going to win.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As you were doing your certification with EASA, I'm assuming this is certification level C. is it, essentially level 1 through level 3? Okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is, well, two different things. DAL C, that's Design Assurance Level. Pilot Eye is, we're taking that to DAL C. That is separate from, the levels of automation, the PilotEye, we'd consider that to be a level one, assistance, pilot assistance system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But none of their certification so far is DAL A. You haven't, DAL B or to DAL A? Okay. It's all DAL C.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh gosh, yeah, Yeah, just so that we're reminded, there is currently, I believe there's currently only one computer, that is certified to DAL A, that is, on a multi core processor. That is running a CPU that is, I believe, already end of lifed, or close to end of lifed. and... A GPU that has already been end of lifed, this takes a long time, right? And so add AI to it and I think that, our first goal in delivering product and delivering, value has been, we just want to prove that you can certify AI. And once we prove that, right, then we can drive toward, higher levels, but keep in mind as well that you don't start with, I want to build a DAL A system or I want to build a DAL B system or DAL C system. You start with the intended function. And, you take your intended function, and then you break that into sub functions, and you, apply a functional safety or, hazard assessment, against those, you assign a hazard classification from level A through E, with A being the highest safety level, safety criticality, that's like a flight control system. With a level E being no, impact to safety. That is the toilet or the, in flight entertainment system. and only when you have a hazard classification, do you start designing your architecture because that tells you how much, mitigation that you need to apply, to any potential, hazards or, safety hazards. And those, mitigations can include redundancy, dissimilarity, for any commercial aircraft the flight control system is not only redundant but dissimilar. And there are flight control computers that are controlling individual flaps, or flight control surfaces, but those are copy exact two to three times, sometimes even four times. And then separately, those flight control computers are designed by two different companies, two different teams, and in most cases, even two different silicon, such that they want to ensure that there is no opportunity for, common mode errors when designing the software. For instance, if I, I have one piece of software that, leads to a fault, that, that does not cascade to every single flight control computer, on my airframe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, let's talk about multi core processors, MCPs. You mentioned that there's only one DAL A certified MCP, and it's using end of lifed CPUs and GPUs. We talked briefly about why AI applications need MCPs for the higher... compute requirements of, running, AI based algorithms on it. But why are MCPs so difficult to certify?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, MCPs are great. In the same way that MCPs are being used, in commercial electronics, for the higher performance, for, the lower power consumption, for the improved efficiency, scalability, being able to execute multiple workloads concurrently, low swap, all those things, are the reason for consumer electronics. Same thing in the Airframe. The issue, though, is that when you need to be certified, the software that's running on the, processor can no longer control all of the behavior of the silicon. So, for instance, in a single core processor, the software, and by software I mean the, the real time operating system, folks like, WindRiver, Lynx, Greenhills, they build this software, in, in that case, you're not competing for resources, you have only one core, you that is doing all of the computing, all of the processing and heavy lifting. And that one core is not competing, with another core for resources, more specifically memory, memory and cache, right? And so when you add additional cores, though, you lose the ability for the software to, control, all of the behavior of the processor. And so now, Core 1 and Core 2, or Core 1, Core 2, Core 3, Core 4, they're all competing for registers. They're all competing for memory, and to put an instruction, into memory, right? And what they generally do today is you start with partitions, and they partition based on the DAL level. And, the overall goal is to achieve, or bound, the worst case execution time. So that means that, let's say, I have, a system that is doing, some navigation, but it is also running, some, say, flight controls. pilot Pull Side Stick, that is a DAL A process, and there should be nothing that is possible that could interrupt that. There should be nothing, no way possible, that instruction, can be kicked off of memory because something else has come up. And, that other thing is now the higher priority. This happens, in consumer electronics, they're actually designed to do these things because, for performance, right? And so I, if I'm working on, Microsoft Word and I switched to another application and now I'm going to start streaming and I go back to my Microsoft Word, right? when I'm clicking back and forth and I'm telling it to do stuff and, play here, but also I want to go back and I want to start typing, for performance requirements, there are times where, for instance, instructions can be kicked out or they can be de prioritized and they're designed to do that. that's how you're able to get the gains that you are from, multi core processors. But, there should never be a case where a DAL C, application such as, displaying, traffic is more important than being able to control the airframe. And, this is why it's... It can be difficult, to certify MCPs because it comes down to a software issue and the software, not having, in the MCPs. The consumer processors not being designed with the tools for the software to monitor the processes, to control the processes fully, and ultimately to bound the worst case execution time. And, in these designs, we turn out to actually, I just say throttle the performance of the MCPs in order to make these guarantees for as much as we can on, developing the software that is going to run on, the processors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so, to what extent is certifying MCPs a purely technical problem of making sure that all of these interference channels and this fight for resources is managed? As opposed to the challenge of just not having visibility into the processor architecture because one of the things that you brought up in the white paper is that, silicon manufacturers are not very keen in sharing that level of detail that you would require in order to build this, resource sharing or mitigation that you mentioned. So, Which is it? What's the main problem? And in the case of, Intel through, the Airworthiness Evidence Package, sharing these... Certification Artifacts, does that solve the problem or is there still a problem remaining?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, This is, it's such a great question. So the airworthiness, evidence package at Intel, that is my claim to fame, I, co architected, safety critical avionics solutions and products for Intel, that product line is my baby and, where I really started in, safety applications, in aerospace. And the issue for the developers of these systems, they have to ultimately be able to predict every possible, failure condition that can happen, and that means that they need to be able to predict the behavior, every possible behavior of their system, right? Their ability to do that is limited to how much information they know about what the processor does and why it does what it does. And the Airworthiness Evidence Package. was about providing, that transparency to the developers, to the embedded, OEMs who are developing these systems. We, went through an analysis with them, and we wanted to understand, what is it, when you say that you want us to support you, OEMs, of the world who want to design in Intel. What is it that you actually need? What do you want? what information are you looking for? And initially when we got that information from them, we realized that there was a good amount of it that was trade secret. to the point that. it wasn't even available to just broadly to the company. And the second issue that occurred was that, the aerospace volumes are just not there. to get a company that is producing millions of processors per day for, consumer electronics orders and orders of magnitude, more volume to get them to operate outside of the process and provide transparency. initially there's, there was no real opportunity there, but what changed that was, it started with the autonomous driving, And a lot of what was necessary was needed for that as well. And Autonomous Driving immediately, they saw that, these are going to be volumes upon volumes of essentially then we also had the opportunity to be part of driving data centers, and there was a big opportunity. And so the aerospace teams, myself, in leading these efforts, we took advantage of what was already happening in order to support the automotive industry, and we conducted a gap analysis between the DO 254 with the, the 26262, which is the, safety guidance, on the automotive side. And for the data, there was data that already, existed, but we generally would not provide. This included, single event upset data, which we would never provide this data because in, in many ways, a knowledgeable, company with this information could essentially reverse engineer, the, architectures and get trade secrets, if they had that information. And so we provided that. We provided, then some, functional safety, failure modes, and errors diagnostic analyses, so we provided failure rate, we ran it through tools, in order to identify, some very critical, behavior of the silicon, such that then when it, was integrated into or would be integrated into a, system that the developer had enough information, that they could provide mitigations. It doesn't mean that you necessarily control it. It could mean that, okay, well, because I don't know when it's going to do this, or, this fault will happen in these very specific conditions. Now I have that information. Maybe that means that I need to provide redundancy and I need to run a separate, processor alongside it and then do some kind of checks, or maybe I need some kind of monitor of, another, processor, such as, say, like an FPGA that is monitoring the silicon and can do something when, this failure condition occurs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>do you think that there is a, path to a generalized approach to certifying MCPs as opposed to having to go through, a lot of, detailed analysis every time that there's a new processor on the market?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I, I think that we're probably about as generalized as we can get, the guidance is meant to, support, what is currently available. It's, CAS 32A, and I think it's the 193? Now, CAS 32A, I believe, is 193. And, so I think we're possibly about as generalized. When there's new silicon, there needs to be detailed analyses and particularly when silicon is meant and designed for a non safety application.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if you take one of these MCPs this certification process what's the expectation in terms of how many years it will remain technologically viable in the market? how much time do we get out of these things before either it becomes obsolete or before it's no longer available in the supply chain and you just have that inventory and that's it? What does that look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, these things go into service for 20 and 30 years. when you have an OEM, an air framer who is aligned on the silicon, you have to be ready to support them for decades. because the cost that are required in order to, provide assurance for these systems are so great. I'm only saying, right now we're talking about just the design, right? Software is its own monster. there was one case where I met with an OEM, a developer, and they said that, they had converted from Intel, by then they had converted from Intel into Power Architecture. By the time I was meeting with them, they said that it was like a decade ago. They said that still they were spending$1 million per year on the architecture, change. And this was in software investment. So it is great, the investment in, getting these things certified. And so they're expected to run, basically forever, essentially. and by the way, this is exactly why when there is a system that goes to market, when it goes to market, there are many stories that folks, particularly on the military side, they can say. I think the worst example was, I had a conversation with an officer. in a military agency that said, the day after we went into service of this airframe, the following day, we received a obsolescence, notice on the silicon this happens often. It's normal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wow. That's such a long timeline for these products. It's totally different than... other industries, and obviously it has all of these downstream implications for, how It's employed in higher level systems, obviously, which is fascinating.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely. And so this is why, we say, well, that we have that one system that's available. And I think it was launched last year, I believe. And, a year later is, the end of life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, would you... encourage innovators to develop multi core computers, and taking them through certification, ground up, or are you a proponent of taking whatever is best of breed in the commercial world and somehow running it through the cert process?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's not really possible to take, a consumer electronic device, and get the higher DALs, it starts, let me take that back, you have to have an insane amount of information that most consumer electronics companies don't, that information doesn't even exist because they don't test for certain things. and so it is very difficult to start with, a consumer electronics device and meet high DALs. And certification starts from day one and from the ground up and there are many companies, by the way, that are developing, rugged, certifiable computers. There's an entire ecosystem that has been created in the last 10 to 15 years that's fully dedicated to developing these systems and I say that's one area where you should just work with the existing ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How do you think that autonomy and certification of AI and MCPs change the existing value chain in avionics and how value is distributed. How do you think that the Avionics value chain will be disrupted?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is a great question. We're seeing a good amount of this across the tech industry as a whole. And, in this market today, it's the avionics OEMs and the air framers who are relied upon to drive innovation, but they are relatively disincentivized to do it. Why? Because the investment for, commercializing, a certified product is so high. And then once you make that investment, you have to then focus on, maximizing your profit. And that means that your assembly lines have to be running nonstop, right? And so when you need to, I guess optimize for, filling your assembly lines, you're disincentivized to innovate because it requires more investment, and it eats into your ability to be profitable, in selling your systems, but what I'm seeing lately is that, this interesting shift is that tomorrow's operators and end users, they're starting to drive some demand for capabilities. They're starting to drive demand for, say, our system, PilotEye. We're finding that it's the operators that are saying, we want this, and we want you to deliver this. And, we're working along the value chain in a way that we didn't expect to be operating along the value chain and traditionally they would apply pressure on the air framer in the avionics OEM in order to integrate and we're seeing some very interesting cases where, they're saying, no, I'm just going to work with you directly. I think one example could be, let's see, Air Methods with Skyrise, right? And in, in that way, I mean that, this is not something, a deal that's including Garmin. It's not a deal that's including the air framer. This is a company that is, delivering directly to, an operator. I think that is relatively new. now how we see this shifting the value as well is, I think that in driving in this direction, this trend, it is potentially going to lead to the hardware, essentially being democratized in a way that the value becomes the software versus the hardware. One example is that there was a time where in operations, just having a camera was huge you had all this additional situational. awareness with a specific kind of camera. Now, once you apply artificial intelligence to it, suddenly the operator's like, No, it's the AI. It's the insights that are delivered from the AI that's where all the value is. And, I think that this is going to be an interesting next, decade in seeing how the traditional avionics OEMs and airframers react to this. another example in consumer electronics is, everyone's, PC, at least ones that have Intel people have a sticker that says Intel inside. No one knows why that even matters, right? So people know Intel because they knew the sticker that was on their computer. but where they saw the value was in Microsoft, right? they see the value in Microsoft. They see the value in Apple, which is, mostly, on the OS and the applications that are built on top of the OS, but not realizing that there are certain functions, For instance, remember when there was a time where you would be typing up a paper on Microsoft Word and your computer goes out and you are screwed. You've lost everything if you did not do a save, right? It was a function in the silicon that enabled the software, to do continuous saves, move, a current instance into, non volatile memory and keep that such that when you turn your computer back on, you can go and get your document. Well, that, that was the Intel inside that, that enabled that. and I think that we're driving in a direction that might look the same way on, the, avionics side and then aerospace side.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, my question, you can answer or not answer any of these questions, but is 80 percent of your revenue today coming from GA\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And two three, four years from now, how will that change?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it'll still be mostly GA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And 10 years from now, what percentage of revenue do you think will be from advanced air mobility?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, 10 years from now, Advanced Air Mobility? it will be larger than the first five years? Haha, it, that's a good question. again, I think, I do believe this goes back to our first question, that, it, we, there will be revenue that is because of advanced air mobility. In fact, I think that if we are successful, it'll be a large amount and, by successful, I mean, that we are directly addressing the cost, we're directly addressing the, resource efficiency and able, to introduce systems that, are commercially viable because there is some level of automation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In order for us to get to level 4 and 5 and DAL A and B, what's the greatest limiting factor?

I don't know that it's necessarily a technological problem. I do think that it's a regulatory issue. There's also parts of it that is, even a perception problem. so many people think AI and they think Terminator. And, we're like, you can also use AI to do boring stuff, just identify non cooperative traffic, right? And so... It's the responsibility of folks like Daedalean, and we're taking this on directly. It's our responsibility to, not, integrate AI and applications that just don't need it, right? And for PilotEye... If it's cooperative traffic, it outputs ADS B. That's great, right? But we provide additional, value in using the AI just for non cooperative traffic. use the technology very wisely and where things are working, take advantage of that. We do believe that, AI enhanced autonomy is the best chance of operating, in environments that are not so constrained that they might completely eat away your economic viability in a way that your operational constraints are so great that you can't scale or, you can only operate for these very specific con ops that turn out to, oh, by the way, they are, low margin or low volume, or they don't scale themselves. Right. So we try to really pay attention to that. And, we take the approach of where there is a technology that exists and it works, we want to do that. And we start with how can AI augment that and support that to ensure that, it enables, more freedom in the way that you can operate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:14:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>5, 10, 15 years from now, paint a picture, if you could briefly, just paint a picture of the level 4, level 5 automation, what's a high probability future look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, there will be cases of level four automation in very constrained operating environments. in 10 years, I think that there will be, less constraints, possibly still mostly fixed route, automation, in some specific con ops, and potentially there might be one or two con ops that, are fully autonomous, again, in very constrained, operating environment. 15 years, I think that's closer where we start seeing some real scale and commercial viability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you're saying, at the same time, that's probably the future of autonomy for advanced air mobility as well, and you're saying that's the viability of advanced air mobility on the same timeline, given your initial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>comments. Right. the tech needs to be proven out and, our company, we're proving out the tech in today's airspace in GA, we don't take the approach that automation and autonomy is an all or nothing, kind of proposition. We say that, we can address this by, leveraging the technology in today's airspace in, limited ways, augmenting the, human pilot in, some ways that then by the time, Urban Air Mobility is ready to scale the technology has also been proven out and has had years of certification credit in order to be proven out and then integrated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can Daedalean meet its financial objectives at just level one and two levels of automation in the next five years?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I believe so. Yeah, I think that we have options. The great thing about what we're doing is not only are we building systems, pilotize a system that gets sold to operators, but we have built a lot of IP in the meanwhile. So the white paper was about proposing an architecture, right? In the meanwhile, we will have the most advanced, and highest performing certified computer that is available. And there is a commercial need for that, right? We have IP, that we are developing all so that we can just deliver, the, machine learn systems. And so I think that provides us with the, ability to leverage and, and take advantage a lot of today's market across segments, in fact,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:17:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, what final message would you like to give our audience?

Automation and Autonomy will also transform aerospace as a whole across all segments of aerospace. and Daedalean will continue to lead the way in, ensuring that we can realize this world that, produces and, makes possible, automation, autonomy, and we're doing that with artificial intelligence, and, we're really leading the world in how to, implement artificial intelligence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:18:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Amazing, Yemaya.
