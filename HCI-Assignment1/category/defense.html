They were \"the guy\". But later, this system integration really enabled them to produce systems that are simply much more performant. If you are not just doing your own manufacturing, but also rather than system integrating components that are produced by other parties, you are actually building all those technology blocks yourself from the chip out and then from within the chip itself, you can start to unlock all these little pockets of efficiency that sit between the black boxes that you would otherwise connect being a system integrator. And it boils down to, in order for these subsystems to be compatible they need to talk over certain protocols, which are designed for interoperability, not necessarily for efficiency, and they're always a compromise. When you have the luxury of owning the black boxes, the two black boxes you need to integrate, then you can open them and you can tweak them and you can optimize for whatever you're optimizing for. And then unlock a tiny bit of efficiency here, tiny bit of efficiency there.

Despite maintaining a low public profile, this innovative team from Croatia has been making significant waves in the industry. Starting with ultra low latency, First Person View goggles for the niche drone racing market, Orqa has expanded to build essentially every drone component, including their own drones, through a fully vertically integrated business model. This approach optimizes both cost and performance and is positioning Orqa is a strong Western alternative to DJI. Welcome to another episode of The Vertical Space, where we have the pleasure of speaking with Orqa's CEO and co founder, Srdjan Kovacevic, about the past, present, and future of small UAS in both civilian and defense applications. Srdjan begins by expressing his disagreement with the belief that hardware in the small drone industry will become commoditized. He underscores the crucial role of hardware in achieving peak performance for small aerial robots. And he traces this misconception back to the early days of the consumer drone industry and highlights how DJI's relentless innovation enabled it to dominate the market. The conversation addresses the challenges and opportunities of vertical integration as opposed to system integration, drawing parallels with the mobile phone industry. We delve into specific examples demonstrating the significance of vertical integration in small drones, particularly in the case of ultra low latency video data links. The discussion also explores how market dynamics and geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine are shaping the drone industry. And Srdjan also talks about the intricacies of FPV systems, their application in modern warfare and the potential future developments in drone technology. As mentioned, Srdjan is the CEO and one of the co-founders of Orqa, the world's leading FPV company. Orqa is dedicated to advancing the state of the art in unmanned technologies and remote vision. Before founding Orqa, Srdjan had a distinguished career in the financial industry with over a decade of experience in asset management. He served as the chairman of the management board of Croatia's 150 million Euro sovereign equity fund and was the Head of Risk Management and Compliance at Croatia's largest asset management company. Srdjan earned academic degrees from University of Oxford with a Master's of Science in Mathematical Finance and University of Zagreb with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering He is a certified pension fund manager and certified investment advisor. Enjoy the conversation with Srdjan after a quick sponsor message.

Especially for unmanned, I strongly disagree with that. I don't think hardware is going to be commoditized. I don't think you can ignore hardware. Or, ignore hardware at your peril if you're doing small things that fly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Expand more, please.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Give us some more details. And then how long do you think this will persist?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think this is going to persist until, critical mass of people are proven otherwise. And, if you ask me that fallacy goes back to, 2014 15 so speaking specifically in a small UAS space, in the drone space, right. And I believe you could trace it back to, point where DJI, really, defeated, 3D robotics, and 3D Robotics decided to pivot in software And, despite the, overwhelming proof otherwise, we keep hearing that mantra that, oh, hardware is going to be commodity, so we should focus on software solutions in the drone space, where, it's glaringly obvious that, the way DJI won was by relentlessly focusing on improving hardware from a generation to a generation of the product and, again, I'll say it, neglect hardware at your own peril when it comes to small things that fly. Software a part of the solution, we shouldn't be neglecting software, but I don't think you can achieve the level of performance if you think you can ignore hardware, or run your software somebody else's presumably commoditized hardware.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Why do we hear hardware can be a commodity? And is there any particular part of the hardware that you think is potentially becoming commoditized?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">so I, I think that goes back to the experience that we had with, a PC world or computer world, like hardware is arguably commoditized there, but, then again, it only takes a look at, what Apple is doing to realize that, yeah, hardware can be commoditized, but if you want peak performance, then you need to vertically integrate and you inevitably end up doing your own silicon, which I believe is going to be the case with the small unmanned and by the way, which is what DJI is doing at the moment. In saying that, people are, willfully or unwillingly ignoring, cherry picking the examples that fit to preconceptions. And I think it's just like, one of those things that are so easy to say, so we don't think about when we say them. But I hate hearing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you think that, this argument is true for component level hardware, or are you referring to the art of integrating a hardware product together with all of the, details associated with it, which we will get into more detail later.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's an interesting observation that you ask it like that, and I think, by saying that hardware is going to be commoditized, we gave up on, the possibility that we can compete with DJI, like a collective, rest of the industry and we're settling for a world of commoditized hardware where, we'll just buy components, that should be interoperable and system integrate them in our own solutions. But it's a good question. And I do think, in a world of other drone manufacturers or other drone systems, arguably the base ecosystems, meaning the Pixhawk universe, or Ardupilot universe, or Betaflight universe. All of these subsets have been driving the development of the software stack, autopilot stack, or flight controller firmware stack towards hardware agnostic solutions to a point where, okay, everybody's running on STM, but like on, on a module level. So I think it's also in specifically in the drone world this approach is actually, giving up on the possibility of competing with DJI which was a fair conclusion up until couple of years ago with decoupling and everything.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">From your perspective, how did we end up in the drone industry where we are today, where DJI dominates in a polarized market, dominating both in terms of growth and product quality, while drone companies in the West are having a hard time competing both in performance and price.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think first of all, we need to agree that DJI is just an amazing engineering company, being started by an amazing founder who relentlessly pursued certain goal and would not accept compromises and infuse the company culture with that sort of attitude. And then, going back, I think again, I'm going to go back to what for me was the pivotal moment in the development of the drone market is 2014, 15 3D robotics coming out with the Solo and then DJI countering with the Phantom. I think that was the turning point where all of us users were finally, able to get a really cheap and highly performant vehicles, drones. And DJI has proven that they're going to be super tough to compete with. And, at the time 3D robotics was one of the most funded Silicon Valley companies. And it was being run just like, pretty much every other Silicon Valley company was run, you do your design and your maybe prototyping on shore. And then, you build wherever it's cheapest. And I think it was the pace of innovation that, that was happening in that space, really just shown how having your manufacturing super close to where your R&amp; D is, that just sets you up, to innovate much more rapidly, to crunch those cycles that you can just out compete anybody else who's trying to do that onshore, offshore kind of approach. DJI started, in Hong Kong, having a vast ecosystem of service providers and manufacturing companies in that local ecosystem certainly helped, but I think this was the, deciding factor that then at the later stages, just, help them compound this advantage and really just, build massive distance between them and everybody else. And, they were just better at building amazing technology to a point where the difference in performance was such that nobody could compete with them. And if like we as work as a, as an FPV company, we felt that, when DJI entered the FPV space, which was incidentally just months after we launched our first product. And I like to say that this was a super scary moment. Imagine you're building an app and your app is, running on an Apple phone. And then Apple decides to, look into that space and all of a sudden that app is part of the standard Apple package. You're pretty much dead, right? So, it felt like that, big 800 pound gorilla, the DJI was entering in a tiny market, which was FPV at the time. And, they were basically able to leverage their influence and access to certain, certain parts of the hardware ecosystem in China in order to provide solutions that were simply out of reach for us. And specifically, this was like, custom built chips that did low latency video, over, over RF, and that was for any other company or almost any other company in the FPV space, that was just completely out of reach from the standpoint of existing know how, access to capital, et cetera, et cetera. So, this is basically an advanced version of what was happening back in 2014. It's just access to different aspects of, technology.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But DJI was also very aggressive in their pricing. If I recall back in 2015, with the Solo, the one that had the GoPro camera and the gimbal, that was priced around 1, 700, while the Phantom 3 Professional package was sold at the same time about 1, 300, but then, a year later, DJI brought the price down to 900 and then slashed previous year's models to as low as 500. And so that pretty much put every other company in the West out of business. And, perhaps because they saw software as an advantage or because it was out of necessity, but Western companies pivoted to software. It was very difficult to compete with that. So, yeah, I agree. It was. It was a very, bleeding edge, innovative product and culture, but it could afford to have such price cuts. And so from that perspective, how did the strategy of their vertical integration play into their ability to outprice the competition. Perhaps this is a good transition to talk about their business model of vertical integration, as opposed to what we see currently in the West and compare and contrast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's an interesting observation and, for me, when I was, looking at that, my first thought was, okay, what the hell they were thinking 3d Robotics pricing their, product at a price point that was higher than DJI, you know, fiercest competitor to begin with. And then, DJI it even went lower than the original pricing. So that, that, that was the first thing that they struck me. But I think that, this vertical integration playbook really benefited DJI at first on the logistics level and on a pricing level where they could simply afford to go down with price because they didn't have a guy that was doing all of their manufacturing that had to make their money. They were the guy. So they could just make slightly less than that. This was a luxury that Western companies could not afford. But later, this system integration really enabled them to produce systems that are simply much more performant. So it was not just the pricing power and the logistics of it, speed to innovate or the ability to slash prices and still make money. It's also if you are not just doing your own manufacturing, but also rather than system integrating components that are produced by other parties, you are actually building all those technology blocks yourself from the chip out and then, otherwise, and then from within the chip itself in, in, in this latest stage, right, that I referred to earlier, you can start to unlock all these little pockets of efficiency that sit between the black boxes that you would otherwise connect, being a system integrator. And it boils down to, in order for these subsystems to be compatible, they need to talk over certain protocols, which are designed for interoperability, not necessarily for efficiency, and they're always a compromise. And then, when you have the luxury of owning the black boxes, the two black boxes you need to integrate, then you can open them and you can tweak them and you can optimize for whatever you're optimizing for and then unlock a tiny bit of efficiency here, tiny bit of efficiency there. And when you look at across the whole system, these little efficiencies compound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Give us some specific examples of where that manifests in drone performance, because as you describe this history, something that jumps at me is how is it that this performance advantage persists nearly 10 years later? If we look in the smartphone space, for instance, 10 years after the introduction of the iPhone, the hardware from competing smartphone manufacturers was all in the same league, right? They were all competing neck and neck. Whereas there's something about robotics or about drones or about this type of system that has enabled the first player and has enabled DJI to, not just have economies of scale, but to have what you're describing as a fundamental gap in performance versus what someone else could build using best of breed components that are available out in the rest of the market. You put those components together and you try and build a performant drone. It's going to fall short, and you're going to explain, hopefully, what that looks like today, and why that is, because I think that gets to the heart of the value of this integration, and it also gets to the heart of your first observation about the conventional wisdom that has been built up over the last few decades of how and why hardware commoditizes. Why is there a wrinkle in this space that challenges that conventional wisdom and leads you to a different conclusion? Let's get down to specifics and really unpack it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the parallel with, mobile phone, industry is a great one because both in, in small unmanned and smartphones, size matters, energy consumption matters and performance matters. And specifically thermals also matter, right? One of the, one of the interesting aspects where tighter integration can lead you to better outcomes than system integration, right. So I think it's a great, it's a great comparison and, In that world, in a mobile world, we have Apple versus others, just as we have DJI versus others in the small UAS world. And it just proves the point that, system integration will get you to a point but it will not bring you to the, the position of the number one player in terms of performance, right? And we're seeing the same thing play out in the smartphone world and in the UAS world. And I'm going to give you an example where this system integration, versus vertical integration really takes you to different levels, and that would be, low latency video as a sort of, specific use for a data link in a small UAS. In low latency video, and this is something that, that, we're very intimately, connected to because this is something that we've pursued and tried to compete with DJI in the FPV world, so we know that really well. In low latency video, there are certain quite different technology blocks that you need to integrate very tightly. And and in this case, system integration, like, it goes one level deeper. It's not system integrating a radio module and a video processing module. It's basically done on the chip level. So if you're not doing your own chips, you need to get a chip that's going to do your video processing, perhaps host to radio, then you need to get your chip, which basically is your baseband chip, right? And the problem with that, and it's that level of system integration. So it's like chip, not board level, but chip level system integration. And in this particular case, neither of those chips have been designed for this particular application. if you're really doing ultra low latency stuff, as we did in the FPV world, in the consumer FPV world, our, measure of latency was in milliseconds, single digit milliseconds. So, like, we need it to be below 30 milliseconds, glass to glass. When the photon hits the sensor to when the photon emits from the display on the other end, that needs to be 30 milliseconds or less.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>22:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Just for clarity, that's important for the human pilot flying the drone to have that sense of instantaneous transparency through to what's happening with the drone. That's where any sense of delay just disappears. Is that what you're\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>23:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, to go to, to frame that further, like, flying, consumer FPV, either racing or freestyle, human is very tightly, embedded in the control loop. The drone is not stabilized in any meaningful way. You are keeping it level by throttling it more or less. So, so you really need, with your eyes, you perceive the response, dynamic response of the airframe and you're providing the control input. It's pitch and roll or it's yaw or it's throttle, which is, arguably the most sensitive part for most of the new pilots, right? Throttle control. So, with low latency video, the lower that latency is, the more tightly you can be embedded as a pilot. You can be embedded into that control, right? This is why latency is important. And, it was funny because when we were thinking about latency, low latency in the rest of the world would be below thousand milliseconds. And there we were counting single milliseconds in order to, acquire frame from the sensor, put it into memory, read it from memory, encode it, compress it, packetize, you know, again, memory write, and then again, make it into a packet, send it off to a radio, and then radio needs to be transmitted, right? So, we're counting milliseconds and, all of these chips are really made for a user experience which operates in a sub second world, half a second here or there, Great example is, encoders, decoders. Like, we're talking about SOCs that have video encoders and decoders. They are made to consume or originate media in an embedded device. Not necessarily to be super fast and super efficient at encoding video and sending it at high frame rates and counting latency in, in milliseconds. So, if you have any latency, you're gonna buffer. And, that you've problem solved. Nobody's gonna, nobody's gonna, notice. So, first of all, like, if, when you start selecting those SOCs and you start asking questions to chip vendors, okay, how fast, yeah, we have a, encoder that's capable of doing, X. Okay, how fast does it compress a frame of certain, resolution? They don't know. They don't care. They don't have that metric, So this tells you that, we're trying to use a chip for an application that was not even like an afterthought to folks. And then on the radio level, on the radio SOC level, like, if you want to be, affordable for consumer space as we want it to be, you need to go commodity and commodity in this world means, Wi Fi SOCs, 802. 11 as a standard is not optimized for that kind of latency. It's optimized and it's designed for, interoperability and coexistence. We need to have a number of 802. 11 APs and station devices that, that, need to coexist in the same space. So they, they need to be able to negotiate how they access the spectrum, and not stamp on each other. That's not what resilient, low latency, radio for unmanned applications is. It's all about, consistently and robustly being able to transmit video packets without interruption to the ground station. And again, you're trying to make that radio chip do something that it has not been designed for and all that firmware that's not been designed for. So like, you're having to make compromises. Or go off standard if you can, which you can't because, the volumes that we're doing are so small that all these chip vendors are not paying attention. So, you end up making all these compromises, which then result in a performance that's suboptimal. Whereas, if you had the full control over the entire black box that is the chip and the hardware encoder, and the black box that is the radio, piece, the 802.11 chip, you would be able to, go into that black box, tweak what you need to tweak, make the two black boxes talk to each other seamlessly and efficiently, and without losing a step. And that's how you get the performance system. And which makes the difference between DJI's video link and everybody else's video link. They had the opportunity to, go into those black boxes and access to those black boxes. Whereas rest of the world had to deal with wiring the black boxes, whether the wires are literal wires or they're traces on a PCB, it ends up being the same thing, right? That's a great example of how, being able to integrate tightly outperforms system integration.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Especially in the absence of standards that emphasize the performance qualities that your market needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Now, how do you balance developing proprietary protocols that you need to optimize the overall system, how do you balance that with the need to interoperate in, call it the modern battlefield or in a commercial ecosystem?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's also, that's a great question. I think, the higher up you are in, the, you can draw parallels with the OSI layers, higher, how much higher are in, in those layers, it's easier to be interoperable and the lower you are to the bare metal, it's hard to be interoperable. And the reason I'm saying that is, you know, maybe you will want to do hardware that's, It's gonna be compatible with the Pixhawk universe, so your hardware needs to be somewhat interoperable, in order to be compatible with, with, Autopilot stack. But then again, you also want some proprietary stuff running there. so it's really, this is one of the challenges of building a hybrid, solutions that combine your proprietary stuff to, open source stuff, if that makes sense. So this is a very tough balancing act. And again, it leads to compromises, but the thing that's, that, suffers is that full compatibility.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So given the benefits of vertical integration how do you explain that, outside of a few companies like Orqa like Skydio, like Autel, I don't know, perhaps there's some others that you would like to mention, but how come that there are relatively few companies who are pursuing this vertically integrated model?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think first of all, vertical integration in the small UAS world is super hard, and this is because there are so many constraints, space, energy, swap in general. And there's a wide variety of different technology blocks, really, very disparate technology blocks that you need to, command in order to basically be in a position to system integrate, right? So, ranging from radio on one end of the spectrum to, I don't know, propulsion on the other. Completely different problem sets, but also interrelated in how they can affect each other in a very tight and confined space, which is a small universe. So, I think that like the threshold to, to actually be able to, start system integrating is pretty high in terms of like, simply starting from the number of different teams that you need to have in order to, to get started down that path. And I think, the type of talent that's required for certain technology blocks in this group, that they could be considered exotic, from the standpoint of like the current talent pool that the West is operating on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you have any observations more broadly on this market dynamics and how it is dividing into different segments where one segment is companies that are taking off the shelf components and putting them together for custom use cases, as we will in this discussion call them system integrators versus some that are vertically integrated, and then also, a handful of others that are also vertically integrated, but also very focused on a specific mission, like Manna like Wing for instance. How do you make sense of this segmentation of the market and the dynamics playing out in the future?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I do think that there's always going to be need for system integrators. If you think of the long tail of applications, a lot of these applications in the long tail are going to be much more efficiently and perhaps effectively served by specific system integrated solutions. And this is why I do believe in a long term persistence of component ecosystem, which will serve a diverse and innovative space of system integrators that will go after these, more or less exotic or like, all of these applications in the long tail. And I'm a firm believer in that. And, there's also, this angle of like the solutions that are addressing the head of the distribution, like, your Matrice or your Mavic, they're going to be great for 95 percent of applications or 90 percent of applications. And that, they're not going to be that great for the rest 10 percent of applications, right? So, there's also that aspect of how useful is your Swiss Army knife? So, in a way, this is like going back to semicon. This is why, all those chips that we end up having to use, are not that great for some, niche applications, like, low latency video, or radio, right? So, so, this is the same, this is the same type of dynamic. So I do think that there's going to be, a vibrant ecosystem of, system integrators that are going to be served by hopefully as vibrant ecosystem of component providers. there's going to be demands for interoperability. And, you know, to counter myself, this is going to be driving towards commoditization because you don't have to have this interoperability and, commoditization there I can accept happening. But if we talk about the head of the curve and really going after these most frequent, most, numerous applications, then in this space, we're going to have fierce competition in performance between the players that are able to vertically integrate, and not only to vertically integrate their supply chains, being able to compete on the economics, but also quickly integrate their R&amp; D, being able to dig deep into those black boxes, integrate them tighter, unlock those pockets of, efficiency that will compound into a higher performance over the competition. And in the small UAS world, that means flying longer. That means, safer mission. That means easier operation, all these things that kind of, make an overall user experience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Can you give a, perspective of near term market size for the component manufacturers, for the system integrator, for the service delivery company. We just heard from Bobby Healy a couple of weeks ago, about the rough size of the service delivery market, and it was in the billions and it was very attractive. But as you talk about the OEM, the component companies, the system integrators, can you give a rough size of near term market opportunity for each?

This low latency video comes from this niche consumer FPV space, which is where, the pressure cooker of consumer FPV where Orqa was born. But, outside of that, at the moment, like, your typical unmanned, remote operation scenario is not that, latency sensitive. Now, the lower the latency is the more dynamic remote operation scenario you can tackle. And, I think it's like one of those things where what's possible technologically, really defines what applications can be, but for the most, remotely operated or like, and even autonomy, right, Everybody's talking about autonomy, whether it's land based or aerial. In any massively fielded autonomous system, there's always going to be a percentage of edge cases where a human operator is going to need to intervene to get the bot out of the situation. Even in, in like, ideal world of autonomy, there's always going to have to be an option to remotely operate. Remote operation is integral part of the autonomy stack because you will need that. Even five percent of edge cases creates a necessity for hundreds of thousands of hours of remote operation. And then the latency of your video is going to allow you more and more dynamic situations, if that makes sense, right? But one thing I'm going to tell you what we were pitching back when we were kind of goggle company and low latency, you know, this was, you know, 90 percent of our stack, we were pitching this kind of remote reality as opposed to virtual reality, which is a technology enabling, an operator a immersive experience of remote real world setting, in a way that would enable the dynamic interaction scenario. So you, it would actually allow you to interact with remote environment. But I think that's still in, in an SF realm, in an SF domain. no,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, in autonomous systems, as most of us have been thinking about them, and the community has been working on them, you'll have video as a sensor, but a lot of processing of that data will be done right there behind the camera, and then only a very small amount of data is transmitted anywhere based on it. In this case, it's looking at, well, if you could transmit the full video, even over an RF link, even over a long distance, and you could do it at this type of sub 30 millisecond latency, what are the implications of that? What does that enable? Whether it's a human on the other end that is consuming the video, okay, that's remote operations, we know about that. Or whether it is machines that are consuming the full video on the other end, is that a frontier that we're looking at? Does that have implications for how you coordinate massive numbers of automated systems and enable them to coordinate very closely together? Is this an enabler to that, or is this a nice to have?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I, I think you're onto something there because like, especially for smaller autonomous systems, if you can displace that power hungry, and hot running compute from a small thing that flies perhaps, then, you would need a way to, to get that, sensory input at lowest possible latency. And, it's much cheaper to run a video compression workload or video pipeline then it is to run a autonomy processing pipeline on a tiny thing that needs to be autonomous. So, so, there's certainly, displacing the compute, displacing the brain kind of thing, which is also an added, benefit to, to like having low latency.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So there have been attempts in the past for Western drone companies to displace DJI, or at least, come close to it in terms of market share, but none really achieved any meaningful, interesting success in scale. Is now the right time? Is now any different? How do you see Western drone companies emerging as a credible threat to DJI?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It is. And I think that the rest of the ecosystem, rest of the world is actually getting a second chance. And I hate to say it, it's part of the unfair advantage that us as Western drone companies have, DJI does not have access anymore to increasingly large swaths of market and applications, and this is creating a vacuum in which, you know, Western companies that are lagging behind in terms of, the performance capability of their system, that they can, try to compete amongst each other in filling that vacuum. So I think,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You're saying because of the ban, because of the ban, that's why the market's being limited.

And then, the ban is creating a space where all of us, Western drone companies can have an opportunity to build something, to, because we, as a collective West, we lost, we lost the first half of the game, of the match in aerial robotics. fair and square, DJI won for better or worse, like, you'll have people saying, oh, yeah, they were subsidized. Yeah, well, probably, yes, they were subsidized extensively, but, we cannot hide from the fact that, they just did a marvelous job at engineering those solutions. And we have a chance to catch up, like collective West to catch up, leverage technology supremacy that we have in other fields, such as semicon. Collective West still has an edge in semiconductors over China. So, we are now getting a second chance to compete in aerial\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So if you were going to put together the dream team, what would you do to make sure the West catches up as soon as possible?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Oh, that's a great question.

I mean, this is, this is our, this is the premise that, that Orqa is building our future five, 10 years. We think that we can grow into a DJI of the West. But I'm a strong believer in DJI of the West having a strong presence both in United States and in Europe. And I believe that being able to serve those two markets, in, in full sense of the word, like being able to have customer intimacy, being able to have strong presence, and being able to, share identity. And then not, it's not just like, Orqa as European company opening offices in the States. It's also about being deeply embedded into the respective ecosystems. I do think that, strongly believe actually that, this is the way to build a DJI Out West. Have a very strong presence in both of these ecosystems on both sides of the Atlantic and, be able to, to really, serve customers on both sides of the Atlantic. And, when we talk about serving customers, there's going to have to be a, super tight integration especially if we talk about on the enterprise level, let alone defense, which is a story in and of itself, but even on the enterprise level, there's going to be, there's going to have to be a tight level of integration with all these aerial data collection devices and, how the data is being used and processed and decided upon, right. So, so, so, that requires, deep understanding of enterprises in their all specific shapes and forms on both sides of the Atlantic. Because, arguably there's a difference in how utilities operate in the States versus EU, for example, right? And then, you can look across all these other potential application areas. I'm not talking about how it's technically operating, but how they're organized, how they function and all these sorts of things. So I do think that this is like a strong advantage to a transatlantic player over any player that's going to be solely in US or solely in Europe, right? And learning from DJI Playbook, integration matters on the logistics point and pricing matters. And like, EU has done a tremendous job of reaching out to, more Eastern parts of the continent and integrating those economies and leveraging the beneficial costs environment. So, there's a good 10 to 15 years where this is going to be an advantage until we kind of level off. So there's going to be a substantial advantage of having a European, a specifically Central and Eastern European base, in being competitive on a cost level, both on R&amp;D side and the production side. So I think this is also an important factor.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Let's talk more specifically about the emergence of a credible DJI competitor. You mentioned a couple of catalysts. One being the, vacuum that's been created by the DJI ban that's been growing in, in scope and we'll see how that discussion ends, but we haven't talked about Ukraine, which is another great catalyst for the entire industrial base. In a world that looks much different than back in 2015 in terms of the maturation of the industry, the components, the supply chain, will the winning playbook be the DJI playbook, or will the maturation of the market and the technologies needed to put together a system like that, will that create an opening for another playbook?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think that, Ukraine and War in Ukraine is a massive, contributor to this, to this dynamic in unmanned, especially aerial system, small UAS and if you think about it, it's a perfect storm. On one hand, like you have these large swaths of market that are not accessible to DJI, primarily in the defense and security sector, primarily defense, and then later leaked out onto the law enforcements and security and critical infrastructure, et cetera. And then on top of that, you have this profound revolution in how defense thinks about UAS combined and, reinforced, right? So, so, before Ukrainian war, defense thought about UAS in terms of fixed wing systems, predominantly half a million, thereabout price point operated on a relatively high echelon of command. And what Ukraine is proving very graphically today is that the bulk of utility of unmanned actually comes from small UAS copters, multi copters, operated on the lowest echelon of command and deployed in massive numbers. And then, if you combine that, like massive need for small copters in the defense sector, and then, defense sector itself being sterile of DJI, like, this is like a complete no go zone, like, maybe there's a gray area in law enforcement, arguably, law enforcement agencies still could use DJI in Europe, but in defense, no way. Right. So the defense is like completely free of DJI competition for all of us other companies. So, these two dynamics are creating a perfect storm for a step up, massive step up in demand for the types of solutions that, would be provided by would-be DJI competitors and providing this initial momentum that will drive the, innovative cycle. So I think, even without the Ukrainian war, this dynamic and this kind of DJI West playbook became viable. The Ukrainian war just cranked it up to 11, really.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So fair to assume that a number of companies will come in and rush to get into and fill that vacuum. How do you expect the competitive dynamics to evolve on each of the segments? Let's look at, the consumer, the defense, the enterprise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So for consumer, I think, we have to look at different segments of consumer. There's like a, retail, consumer, market, which is, basically still, open for competition and DJI is untouchable there simply in terms of performance, the price, pricing power, it's the obvious choice for the consumer. Now, if we talk about educational segment of consumer type products, that's a different story because again, especially in US, this is also an area where Western companies have this unfair advantage that we can leverage in order to get business, be able to reinvest in R&amp; D and provide solutions that are going to be fully Western made. So, there's these two different sectors. And we as a company, we're looking at educational space where we can provide fully Western made solutions. And then we look at really some niches where we can compete on a purely technological and pricing basis. Now, enterprise is still, I believe, somewhat contested, although I've heard examples where, companies are really reluctant to go for DJI or Chinese solutions. So, this gives an unfair advantage to, to, Western companies. I think this is going to be contested, and it's going to be harder to compete with solutions that are not, as performant as DJI, however you want to measure performance. But I do think that, as opposed to consumer, you will still be able to sell a good enough solution. You know, you don't need to be better, you just need to be good enough to be able to sell. And there's like a large portions of that enterprise market where this is going to be the case. And then defense is, defense is purely like, it's going to be, and it's not going to be, it is right now the space where we're going to see most of, the business, happening for Western drone companies, in the small UAS or multicopter space, which is typically dominated by DJI. I'm not talking about Fixed Wing type platforms. We have a lot of great companies operating in that space across the board, talking about really small copters.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What are the major cost drivers for developing a small UAS system? What we hear is that for performance that is, somewhat approaching DJI's performance, you can get that from a Western drone OEM for three, four, five times the price, depending on, on, the specific use cases, et cetera. Can you generalize the major cost drivers and how certain catalytic forces like the Ukrainian war and the broadening of the industrial base, how that might impact those prices?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think volume is the dominant one. I don't think that prior to Ukraine, there was a conceivable scenario where a Western drone company would be in a position to sell a lot of copters to government users. Now with Ukraine happening, what we're seeing is a lot of, Western defense, end users are waking up to the fact that copters are going to be needed and copters are going to be needed in large volumes and copters are going to be used in an attritable manner. You deploy them and you're going to expect to lose them within three missions. So you better stock up on them. And not just that, you better invest in a capability, churn them out in large numbers, should you need them. Now this is a major contributor to, to really willingness to buy, willingness to invest in this capability, and like in the capability to, to develop these technologies, right, and support, Western companies and giving them business and contracts, et cetera. So I think volume is the main, you know, this understanding that, small UAS, small copters, that's, if you look at Ukraine, like this is all Mavic and Autels are the workhorses of the battlefield on both sides. And we as a collective West do not have a solution that's comparable to either.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You've been an early and leading player in the FPV segment, which now has emerged, or has grown from a very niche to volumes that dwarf any other segment. So can you talk about how you've experienced this evolution and kind of the trends that you're seeing and how you see the future?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's interesting because, before the war, we, had all these different strategies on how to popularize FPV because, you had to explain to people what FPV is. And for very unfortunate reasons, FPV has arguably become a household word now. And, you know, how that plays out, and I'm talking as a company that, that was started as a hobby company, consumer company, how that plays out and how FPV is perceived after the war, you know, it's anybody's guess. And I'm not entirely comfortable as FPV enthusiast, I'm not entirely comfortable with that situation. I don't know whether FPV is going to exist after the war, or, will we be able to fly FPV as civilians after the war. So I'm not entirely comfortable with that. But what Ukraine started is like, it showed how effective, consumer grade technology can be in a modern war. And that's the, I think the most impactful part of the whole dynamic that, that developed because, what's being used in Ukraine is essentially a hobby grade, technology that's incredibly accessible from the cost perspective, from the technological perspective, you need a bit of skills to build, and quite a lot of skill to operate, this type of vehicle, but nevertheless, super accessible. Like I cannot be expected to build a Javelin myself in my garage, but I can build an FPV in my garage. And with an FPV, I can probably hit a tank at a greater distance than I can with a Javelin. And I can bill it for like, what, 300, 500? And, Javelin is what, hundreds of thousands? So, this gives you an idea of how much disruption happened\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Can you just describe first person view? What is it? What's its value? What happens if somebody doesn't have an FPV capability for those who may not know as much about the market?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So FPV stands for First Person View. It's what we used to call our hobby prior to the war. FPV today stands for a first person view, manually controlled, quad captor. That is a radio controlled, a drone that's capable of carrying an explosive payload and it's operated fully manually, like as you would a race drone, by a skilled operator. And, this is basically, you can fly a drone for, a couple of kilometers and you can, strike an armored vehicle, which costs in millions with an asset that's, you know, the, some people call it an, like a flying IED that, that costs like hundreds of bucks, to build. And, we've seen a lot of companies coming up, in that space, being a component provider, we could see a lot of Western companies coming into that space, but in reality, Ukrainian war in particular, although that created a lot of interest in the West and that, created a lot of companies that are looking in that space, realistically, this again, was dominated by Chinese companies who were well placed, to serve both the needs of Ukraine and Russia in providing either components or build systems. And I think, if you look at, how various Western companies performed and Orqa included, trying to compete in that space, like again, we collectively couldn't compete with the Chinese on, on, on prices. And I don't think we should, because longterm, I think that FPV is specific to Ukraine and it's a phenomenon that's, indicative of absence of other means of strike by both sides, and, whether, strapping an explosive ordnance to a copter, whether that's going to be a optimal way to do precision strikes, that's anybody's guess. And my guess is, you know, probably there are more optimal ways to perform strikes, kinetic strikes. But what I'm certain of is that copters are the optimal way to provide battlefield transparency, the type of which we're seeing in Ukraine right now. And, as much as I don't think that the FPVs as a strike capability are going to stay here post Ukraine, I'm 100 percent certain that copters, which may or may not be FPV and arguably don't need to be FPV, will persist as a principle way to provide situational awareness and battlefield transparency, in the future. I'm not saying that the fixing platforms are going to be done, but I'm saying that, we're still going to have these fixing platforms operated on a higher echelons, but we're going to see much more copters being operated on a very low command levels. The challenge is going to be really collecting all of the data and then processing it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What have you observed in terms of how FPVs are being employed in Ukraine? How has it changed since early 2023 to today? What do you see coming in the future, and what is it about that that makes you think that FPVs are perhaps unique to the Ukraine conflict and that they're not going to continue to evolve in this way for future conflicts that they'll be supplanted by something else. I think that there are people out there with, the assumption that this evolution, what we're seeing in Ukraine is going to continue and that Western militaries across the spectrum are going to be rearming with, massive numbers of FPVs and incorporating these into their tactics as a lesson from the war. But if you have a different view on how that's going to look, walk us through that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Oh, yeah. I think, if, if you wanna have the nitty gritty realities of use of FPV in Ukraine, I strongly advise, listening to War on The Rocks, podcast and Russian Contingency where, Rob Lee and Mike Kaufman are really, delivering direct from the battlefield experience of FPV operators. And this is very detailed and highly informative in terms of tactics. So, what we're observing, is basically there's, some cat and mouse development in terms of electronic warfare countermeasures and being able to deploy these systems, freely, so there's a big change between, what was working at the early stages of war to what's working now. We're seeing a lot of, evolution in terms of how the electronic warfare measures are deployed and how the, systems are evolving to, be able to, operate in the presence of, electronic warfare. So there's that. These FPV systems are being, operated in an increasingly larger numbers. And basically both sides have been very successful in adopting those and evolving the tactics of their use. But ultimately I think, again, this is a specific for Ukraine because, simply because barring, drones, FPV drones and drones in general, and the anti air systems this is a very low tech war, ultimately. And, these FPV systems are being applied in a, a bolt on manner. And whether I'm seeing FPVs that are being used in Ukraine right now being used by, uh, in this form by Western NATO member countries, I would say no. Just starting from the fact that once you power up the drone, you're broadcasting unencrypted video feed to whoever cares to tune in. Like, just start from that. And, this goes from the fact that because of the latency, and because of the EW resiliency, you're compelled to operate an analog video system, and there's no efficient way to encrypt or scramble analog video system, just that, that leaves you with having to broadcast your mission, to whoever wants to tune in in the vicinity. So, so there's that. Also, like, I don't think that we should be falling into a trap of thinking that these are super efficient systems simply by looking at social media. And this is one thing that, that really, repeated by the people who had the chance to really observe how these systems are being employed. Like the efficiency numbers are super, super low. because. If we look on the social media, we're just seeing the strikes, but, then there's a massive, positive selection, happening there, right? So you will not see unsuccessful strikes being posted on Twitter and, you know, all the FPV pilots, from before the war, they know that, whenever you fly, you turn on the DVR because, if you lose a drone, that's how you find it by looking at the DVR footage. You can imagine that if every FPV mission is filmed and the operator has the footage, then you could even, say that we have seen every successful strike that happened, right? And we can be fairly certain that most of the successful strikes have been actually recorded. And in the world of social media and viral dynamics, this creates a powerful echo chamber where we all think that this FPV is this super efficient new asset, which, you know, we really have no grounds on making that conclusion because we don't know how many unsuccessful ones there have been for every successful one that we see. So, this second piece is efficiency. Third piece is, FPVs are really hard to operate. It takes a lot of skill, and this was one of the barriers to entry to the hobby before the war, which we were facing as a consumer company, like it's really hard to get people to remain and then to persist in the hobby long enough so they can enjoy it. Like, you really need to struggle before you get the skill and you can actually enjoy flying because it's not that easy. And I have hard time imagining, FPV being deployed in a big army sense. I can totally imagine it being deployed in a highly specialized manner. So, I can totally imagine FPV being a part of a special operator's toolkit, like that skill set, right? So, you train for a sufficient time, you become a great pilot. And then this gives you almost superpowers, right? And then arguably this can be a, a Special Ops thing rather than a big Army thing. Then again, simply the logistics of, deploying large number of FPVs is a stretch to be, you know, diplomatic. I mean, I'm going to give you an example. Whenever we would go out and fly for fun, there was always problems with frequencies and 5. 8 band, which is where you, where your video operates is very narrow. So you effectively have eight channels. And if you go out with a group of friends, like five or six of you, it's a logistic nightmare to make everybody stick to their own frequency. Right, so you always have this situation you're flying and somebody plugs in and they're on your frequency so all of a sudden you can't see anything. So trying to extrapolate that experience to a chaos of war where there's not only your side trying to deploy these missions en masse. There's adversaries trying to deploy these missions, like it's a nightmare. it adds to that thing about how efficient it really is, this question. So, compounding these five, different aspects of, like, reality of FPV I don't think it being used massively for strike. What I am, again, I'm going to say it, what I'm seeing this Ukrainian war changing in a way, how, army uses, copters is this situational awareness, mass deployed, highly attritable platforms for, defense applications. And, as an FPV company, we get a lot of, oh, FPV is the big in Ukraine. you guys, must be selling hundreds of thousands. And I'm like, no, the only ones making money in this FPV space in Ukraine are Chinese companies that, that perhaps they were making ready to fly drones in maybe single digit thousands per batch. I can totally imagine a lot of these companies doing tens of thousands per month, easy. And that led, funnily enough, that led to the commoditization. the price per system is like 500 bucks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Isn't there an argument though that technology will continue to innovate and try to close some of the gaps that you were talking about, whether this is better use of the RF spectrum, better, digital data links that are also resilient to EW, better logistics, better deployments, better ways for humans and machines to interface. Isn't that a valid argument that this arc of technology evolution will continue and make FPVs relevant in the future? Or if not, how do you see that arc continuing to evolve?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and I would add increasing automation of the flight control itself. All of those things, what would you want to see in terms of changes across that spectrum of technologies that would change your conclusions?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, I think, one of the gaps, certainly is, spectrum management. It's also EW resiliency for the high throughput data links, and video arguably is a high throughput data link. It's very hard to sustain sufficient data throughput over an RF data link for digital video. If you think that even 10 percent package loss of a compressed video is total, video loss. That's, super hard to sustain even in a congested RF environment, let alone contested RF environment. So, so, that, that's going to have to change in order for, these systems to be viable and a prerequisite for like, I think wider adoption, FPVs is going to have to be moving away from freely broadcasted analog video, which all of the FPVs you're using both in defense and in the hobby are being used, are using right now. I can totally see a benefit in adding automation and autonomy to these systems. It's gonna reduce the barrier to entry for skill required to operate. It would not have to be a matter of dexterity and ability to, to really, fly and, skill it's gonna, it's gonna be learned and it's gonna, you'll be able to learn more efficiently. But also, and I'm going back to this point of whether copters are the right strike vehicle. And that's always this thing that I'm coming back to. And I know that this trope of swarm of drones is a very attractive one, but have you ever seen how drone light shows are being deployed? It takes a stadium to set them up. So you're literally setting up an acre of drones almost in order to deploy a light show. So this trope of having swarms of drones attacking, like you would be, you, there, there's a lot of logistics that needs to go in, in deploying a large number of drones. And if one thing that we've learned about this war is that in a transparent battlefield, you need to reduce your logistic footprint, not, so, so in, in a way, we're going to have to, innovate, like collective we, we're going to have to innovate heavily in order to come up with a smaller footprint for deployment swarms, if we want to make swarms a thing. And then it brings me to the question, is copter really a great platform for strike? Or are there more, like, compact, efficient platforms to deploy strikes at that distance with that type of payload. And again, I have to go back to saying, expressing an opinion that, I think that both Ukraine and Russia are using FPVs as a matter of necessity and accessibility. It's more of an accessibility thing, because all you need is 500 bucks of Chinese components, some carbon, and explosives, to be able to affect a, precision strike beyond line of sight. And that's it. and, couple that with virality of the footage that, we established is recorded for every mission by default, because this is what you do as an FPV pilot, you DVR everything. Like, when you add that two things together, like, you get this impression that, oh, it's a massive thing, whereas, reality might be completely different. But what we are seeing is, a lot of Western forces are, working to, acquire these capabilities to, learn how to deploy them, learn how to use them, learn how to defend against them. And I think this is going to be here to stay, but I think that, this is a starting point and it will necessarily evolve and what's the end state, the, final form of it. Anybody's guess. And I'm really not. even, arguably being an insider and understanding, this, deeply because, we were doing it before it was cool. I wouldn't dare to venture where it lands, like, what's going to be the final shape of the strike vehicle, and I'm not sure it's going to be a copter. On the contrary, I'm kind of willing to place a bet that it's not going to be. Where I'm willing, again, 100 percent to place a bet is like for, low level ISR situational awareness, there's hardly a better thing than a copter.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Srdjan what's the message that you'd like the audience to take away from this discussion?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, two messages, like, first of all, building small things that fly, it's super hard.

So I think, ultimately if there's like one or two things, this would be that, this is hard, this is very hard.

I love sports and I always think that speed kills. What I mean by that is if I put so many things in front of you or move so fast that it causes you to have to make a really quick decision, the human brain and even computers can only make so many right decisions before they make a wrong decision. So if you can create that chaos and use that to your advantage or the threat of that chaos, I think that's a really good deterrent and that's what led us to found Firestorm with the idea of democratizing the sky. Build so many things at such a low cost that are modular so that you can use this platform for a variety of missions that you could literally paint the sky black.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Welcome back to The Vertical Space. Today we're joined by Dan Magy the founder and CEO of Firestorm, a California based company, developing low cost and modular military UAS systems. Dan's entrepreneurial history includes the founding of Citadel in 2016, a counter drone company employing various technologies, including radio-frequency jamming to detect and mitigate unauthorized drone threats. As you can imagine this rich background sets the stage for a really insightful conversation. We kicked things off by framing the counter UAS challenge, highlighting the inadequacy of most technologies developed in the past decade in mitigating modern drone threats, particularly on the battlefield. Dan talks about the founding and early days of Citadel and what it was like to navigate the complexities of selling to the government while responding to the urgent need of countering small drones in various hotspots in the world. We then explore the evolving nature of the drone threat and how this is leading to a sophisticated cat and mouse dynamic. We talk about the new realities that warfighters and drone operators in regions like Ukraine are adjusting to and how this is shaping the counter UAS landscape. Throughout the conversation, Dan draws parallels to Firestorm's strategy of overwhelming adversaries with mass and modularity. We also touch upon the significance of product and user interface simplicity, how to ensure long-term defensibility of drone companies, the reasons why U.S. drone companies are struggling in Ukraine, and some emerging technologies on the horizon that Dan is excited about. Enjoy the conversation with Dan after a brief sponsor message. Dan, welcome to The Vertical Space. Great to have you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>3:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you for having me. I'm really excited to be here and talk all things drone and counter Drone over the next hour.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>3:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We usually start by asking if there's anything that very few in the industry agree with you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>3:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very few. I think, I have a very strong take on, where, counter drone is going, and I don't think that a lot of the solutions that have been funded or fielded today are going to work, I think, in, like, literally months or a year. So that's probably where the biggest disagreement in this field comes from. I think if you're asking me domestically versus globally, I think domestically people still think that, now if we're going to talk about drones, that what we've built for the last 20 years is going to work just fine. And when you actually talk to people overseas, they need a totally different type of drone because we're now fighting in environments that have massive jamming capabilities. So that's a two part answer to your question.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cool, and we'll explore both of those, but just as a bit of a teaser, what counter UAS technologies specifically do you think are, not overhyped, but given probably too much credit and likewise, what are the methods that you think really are promising?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm going to answer the second part first and say, I don't know a lot of stuff that is promising right now, because I think the world has changed so fast in the last year that we've not caught up to the reality that, most FPV drones, right? We'll call them$1,000,$2000, whatever you want to say,a lot of them are now have basically a terminal guidance chip that's put on them for 50 bucks that once you figure out what you want to hit, a yellow box comes around and you hit go and you let go of the drone, right? And so even if you're jamming it, it's going to go run into what it sees. And that's just a fundamental change that has happened. And, you know, these things move fast, so if you're talking audio or, optical, maybe you have at max six to seven hundred meters at max, and that's probably in a quiet environment. or a non busy environment. there's not a lot of those out there in the world, right? It's one thing if you're on a FOB in the middle of northern Iraq, it's another thing if you're fighting in kind of a ruined village in Ukraine. So, I think the future is going to be kinetic or it's going to be EMP based. Those open massive sets of, other problems in the counter UAS space, and we can dive more into this, but like, shooting bullets at a drone or shooting projectiles at a drone when you miss, you have to now think about collateral damage in a way you don't have to with like, RF or spoofing or hacking. I think those three areas are going to have a lot of trouble. RF, spoofing and hacking. One from an encryption standpoint, two because the Ukrainians and Russians are literally hopping between channels and signals depending on what the electromagnetic environment looks like. And then three, because one, people are actively building some really interesting non spoofing technology and I think that you're going to see a ton of SATCOMs come into this or drone over LTE, which opens an either larger can of worms, as far as like, what are we okay, either one violating from a privacy standpoint or two disrupting from just a fundamental usability of all the electronic systems we use in our life standpoint.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in a peacetime environment, certainly huge Fourth Amendment consequences Okay well how about we dive right in this Counter UAS theme For those who don't know, you founded Citadel back in the day. That was the first wave of Counter UAS technologies, and maybe to frame the conversation or actually, you know, what, how about you frame that state of the market at the time?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>what the technology was like and what enabled this, initial crop of counter UAS companies to emerge and just, tell us a story of what that journey looked like for you, of founding Citadel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the founding of Citadel came out of like a need that was shared with me from my company before that from a variety of heads of securities at sports stadiums saying we have a problem with drones. This is 2015, and that we don't have anything that can stop drones from flying in. Mind you guys, this is nine years ago, right? So this is an old problem, right? And I literally Google searched what was out there and then wrote a patent on an airplane flying back from Boston after the Patriots head of security told me that, like, they're not just at the practice field now, so they think it's other teams spying, but they're, like, coming into games, and I was like, okay, now I've heard this from enough people where this is something we should go after. I am not an RF technologist. I really didn't know what I was getting myself into. I put together a really good team and, we basically used a very cool algorithm we've built, to detect and then mitigate drones and that's what we got. When we started, it was simply just like, find the drone, find the controller and attack it. And what we didn't know at the time was that for how much of a security threat drones bring to public infrastructure, the laws were not going to change anytime soon to interfere with the drone or to jam a signal. And that, there's kind of two groups and one of them has to ask permission from the other group to use that type of technology domestically. So we by accident became a defense contractor when Naval Special Warfare found us end of 2015, early 2016, when ISIS was using DJI drones and modifying them much like the Ukrainians and the Russians are today, to legitimately own the airspace from 500 feet and below in the conflict in Northern Iraq and Syria. Like, they owned it. and they had drone factories where they were modifying them to have servo motors to drop bombs. They were using them to coordinate the vehicle based IED attacks, artillery, RPGs, like everything. They were their ISR and little bomber drones, right? They're a true multi mission,$500 system. What Naval Special Warfare told us is they tried to repurpose a bunch of the jammers that were on the trucks for the roadside based IED stuff, and it wasn't working. So they were desperate to try and find new stuff. And, I think they were, we were one of the first handful of companies that were out there. Another prominent one here in San Diego is SkySafe. They're still around. But we got that first contract. We got, VC, and they invested in us, and, we then had the time and the money to really build out the technology into what it is today. I'll say, we didn't know how to sell to the federal government, right? And so, Luka, I think I've said this to you multiple times. It was like getting punched in the face every day until you learn how to maneuver in this area. And eventually you hire the right salespeople who actually understand how to sell in this area, to one, you know, build the hype train around the product. And we had and have. Probably the best RF counter UAS system in the world. it's a SOCOM program of record. But we also didn't understand how the game works. We didn't understand you got to be going to DC. We didn't understand you got to go win the Labs, right? Like, there's just a formula for how to do this. We didn't understand that. And so I think you saw from 2015 to 2017, maybe four or 500 counter UAS companies started in that first wave. We had a customer where we provided excellent customer support. They liked what we were doing, they liked our vision, and we made some really crucial technical hires that dramatically brought down our false positive rate and then increased the ability for us to interdict a drone without bringing down other Wi Fi systems. Which allowed us to gobble up parts of that market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What was novel about your technology? Why did yours work where others didn't work in the past?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'd say, you know, and you could ask any of the founders or a lot of the team that's still there today. The company was acquired by, Blue Halo at the end of 21 right before we became Program Of Record, it's small, okay? A lot of counter US systems are really big. It has what I would say is the best user interface in the entire industry. It is so simple to use and set up that an 18 year old kid could figure it out. I mean, and maybe they're better with technology, but you could say maybe a 50 year old person who's never really touched the system. How's that? Maybe that's a better analogy, right? And then the two other things are we invested very heavily in our AI team and we had a really good data pipeline and training approach that allowed us to remove false positives, right? Build a more robust model to match a drone signal in a very noisy RF environment. And then we built some proprietary kind of amplification technology and integrated in there. One that let us rapidly move between channels to step on, the signals, and two kind of increased power from what you could just buy, if you need to make noise on a drone signal or channel, for without, like, without what's available, on market today. So does that kind of give you a good idea for why we're, it's easy use. It's correctness and identifying things. we talked about this idea at the time called the Hunter algorithm, where we built this algorithm that would be able to see a drone when it comes out of a box before anyone else did that. And to this day, it's pretty amazing. you talk to guys who are still there and they're like, yeah, new drone comes on the market. The machine already knows it's a drone, right? it's pretty cool. So I think that, that really helped. And, we kept our BD team pretty small. And that's something where we'll, when we talk about Firestorm in a minute, like it's really easy to go spend a lot of money on marketing and BD. And we kind of had to go all in on defense because we didn't think commercial was going to happen. And there's a couple of companies out there like Dedrone that have raised unimaginable amounts of money and they're going after those markets. And I don't think as we see wave two right now, unless there's like a massive attack that you're going to see a change.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If we think back to those early days of the market that you're describing right now, 2015 ish timeframe, commercially available drones were rather, the fleet variety was not obviously at the level of today. And so it was arguably easier to build RF libraries for these drones to then go and counter. And for the most part, the radio links that they relied on were based on the highly proliferated electronics coming from China, that operated in ISM bands, not really encrypted, no frequency agility. It was a, good old dumb radio quote unquote. And so those early RF detection mitigation efforts worked fairly well. But, and by the way, from what we hear in Ukraine, there's still, those kinds of early,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They're there. Yeah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>e lectronic warfare solutions that work because most of DIY FPV drones that people put together are relying on those same, non intelligent radios. But, but, but the threat is changing, the attacker is getting more sophisticated in terms of frequency agility, deception, spectral awareness. This, move counter move, dynamic is evolving to the point Electronic Warfare of the past is no longer good, especially if you're facing, as we mentioned before, low, fast, erratic moving, break line of sight type of drones. And so when you project that arc of evolution on the drone side even further, what do you think EW 2. 0 looks like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Good question. I want to add a little bit of context to that story you just told, and I think it's actually really important for like, why we're in this situation today. When we started Citadel, there were actually a lot of different kind of, we'll call them smaller providers of the DIY solutions. And I think DJI made such a good product. And then when they introduced Lightbridge, Lightbridge 2, all of the iterations that you can make when you have 200 PhDs working on this stuff, right? they really consolidated a lot of the providers in the market, both from a product standpoint and then from a like, who the suppliers are going to work at. And so, why I'm saying that is the DJI tech stack, even if you have an intelligent jammer, it moves around when it sees interference, okay? And that's what should have been warning us five years ago that what you just described, right, let's call it intelligent RF, was going to come. And now that there's a war and you have Ukrainians and Russians and Iranians building tens of thousands of drones a month, and they're disposable, the unit costs to go build, those competitive technologies are going to drop down. So what's gonna happen what we've seen and what we've been told, by both Ukrainians and, friends who've spent a lot of time on the ground there, and from our trips to Ukraine is this that. Basically, everyone's monitoring the spectrum at all times, okay? And a lot of the, wideband jammers you're starting to see are being built out there where you have to find the drone in the noise if you're looking for that control link because you can now move between, channels and frequencies with ease, right? And I think we're in the first inning of that. I think by the end of this year, we're going to see some new products that do it even better than they're doing today. But what the Ukrainians and the Russians have done is they've basically adjusted their tactics around a couple key assumptions, right? One is that there's going to be no GPS for 40 to 50 kilometers along the FLOT the front line, right? Maybe 10 kilometers on each side, 40 kilometers in the middle. You are not operating with GPS. That's your first assumption. Okay? So if you start with that, and then you start with, oh, and by the way, everyone has jammers or RF signal, detectors that are able to triangulate sitting in trees so that when you launch a drone, if you don't launch it super far back or put it in the air really quickly and move, we will be able to lock on to where you are in your region and we're going to go put a lot of artillery shells right there. So those are just the key assumptions that everyone's operating under right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>table stakes basically\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's it. Correct. And so what do you do and how have they adapted? One, you look at alternative frequencies. So maybe things like Starlink or flying over LTE. And remember, there's also not a lot of LTE here because they know this happens. So they go and blow up the towers, right? But the second thing you do is you build signal repeaters and you either put them in trees, right? Or you put them on other drones. And that is how today, a lot of the stuff, if you like go on my LinkedIn, you're watching coordinated attacks from ISR drones to FPV drones. That's happening a lot of times with, the Ukrainian drone that uses, they like to call it the Baba Yaga, Which is like the witch that, steals children. You put it in the air, it's a lot harder to triangulate it because you can one, move it around, or if it's tethered to a car, you can drive the car around and the drone will follow it, right? You also, when you're up at 1, 000 feet or 800 feet or 500 feet or whatever, you also get a better line of sight. So now, these FPV drones that usually, at the start of the war were going 1 to 5 kilometers, they're flying them 30 kilometers. So I think this whole thing starts to change and we are building a fleet of products out of the same manufacturing cell and now we're building the software to coordinate all of them where people are going to have coordinated drone swarms that do that. You're going to have ISR drones that tell smaller kamikaze drones to go attack stuff and today they're in five to ten person kill teams but in the future that'll all be automated and it's coming in the next 12 to 18 months from Firestorm. We're not the only people who are seeing how this works, and they're basically building, one or two person drone teams that can go achieve this type of success. And I think that's going to make fighting RF really difficult. You're going to need bigger, more expensive solutions. You're going to need layered defenses, right? and I would not be surprised. a lot of this is starting to be open sourced, like the Russians and the Ukrainians are using drones that they basically preload an image of what they want to go run into the drone, and then they go send it in the air and they have it go hunt. And I think that's where one, humans get really scared because robots are making decisions. Two, we as the West, there's tons of material out there saying is this the world we want to live in? Right? And so there's some philosophical discussions we need to have as a society. I think whoever starts getting to that technology first is going to have a massive upper hand in the next coming decades. It's, and it's going to happen because there's a war where it's already happening and they're getting better with every rep.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of all of the counter UAS response options that exist today from guns and drone interceptors and direct energy weapons and electronic warfare, nets, falcons, eagles, streamers, aerosols, you name it. Which have the potential for the most rapid adoption and scaling? If you were to, start another counter UAS company today, what would you focus on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I can't start an RF one cause I still have a non compete for a couple of years. But, no, I would just invest super heavily into something that does drone on drone. I would attack a very certain part of the chain. I think the game is going to be go after the motherships, whether that's the Baba Yagas that are the signal repeaters or the ISR birds that are at, a couple thousand feet doing laps for five or six hours or 10 hours trying to find targets. I would try and basically either cut off the repeaters or the eyes. And I think you can do that in a way because a human is still in the loop today, and they will be for, I think, a while, running that part of the operation. If it's a guy with an FPV drone flying this one to five kilometers, one to 10 kilometers, those people are always going to be there. But I think as you see the coordination of those things, you got to try and either attack that or even go left to launch, And that's when stuff gets super gnarly and that's where our intelligence agencies need to be playing. If they're not already.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And left of launch is easy to say, and it makes sense for, larger aircraft that have a more meaningful launch and recovery footprint.

So guys poke holes in this, but like we did a phenomenal job in the war in Afghanistan and then even in the ISIS fight in Syria of figuring out where these, roadside bomb factories were coming from by tracing where the money was going. And I remember distinctly when we were working with Naval Special Warfare, when they told us yeah, we found the 2 million dollar order of DJI drones that went through Turkey that were obviously then just walked across the battlefield into Syria and were dispersed into the factories. That's the type of stuff if you look at like supply chain for these things, right. You could have a hundred people swiping a credit card, but if you're going to do this on an industrial scale, you got to figure out where are, and again, this is maybe more terrorist than like state actor, but who's buying, 15, 000 batteries,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>right? This is far left of launch.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm talking way far left to the launch. If you want to go closer to left to launch, you're going to need persistent ISR and satellites. That's what you're going to have to try and figure out, right? It's like, where are their launch fields? Are there patterns? But the problem with a lot of these things too, is you can take them out of a car, put them in the air or use a catapult, right? Pack it all up in two minutes and leave. So I'm not smart enough to say, that's how you should go after that. But I would just tell you like the RF triangulation and then some of the interesting things like the Ukrainians, like they've talked about how they have these 50, 000 Samsung phones all listening for the sound of a Shahed across their border. And then once they match that sound, like that's the type of creative thinking you need, which is a lot of low cost sensors doing fusion, and crunching data, in my opinion, if we're going to start figuring out, how do you actually maybe stop some of these things from happening? We're just not there yet today. And don't, I haven't personally given it too much thought yet. Cause it's so daunting of a challenge\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dan, I just keep coming back to the question of mass, and how if you look at the countermeasures in the RF spectrum, you look at the idea of countering things left of launch, but if your opponent is throwing a lot of mass into the air, a lot of air vehicles, they're transmitting on a lot of different channels, how does that change the assumptions in this approach? Because when we're talking about drones that are at this type of price point and that can be mass produced this way, I think mass takes on a new role all its own that we haven't seen in recent decades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Completely. And it's because we didn't have to fight people who had these type of counter measures for the last 20 years. Right? So the global war on terror basically leveraged a lot of kind of legacy Cold War systems and repurposed them for a fight against an insurgency that was not a high tech insurgency. And I don't mean that like the Taliban and ISIS and Al Qaeda, they figured out ways to do a lot of really nasty stuff. But it's not like you have, 80 years of state sponsored universities like you have in Russia or, Tehran or China. Where you pump out really good engineers who are now being co opted to solve some of these problems. For me, Peter, I try and keep this really simple. I love sports and I always think that speed kills. What I mean by that is if I put so many things in front of you or move so fast that it causes you to have to make a really quick decision, the human brain and even computers can only make so many right decisions before they make a wrong decision. So if you can create that chaos and use that to your advantage or the threat of that chaos, I think that's a really good deterrent and that's what led us to found Firestorm with the idea of democratizing the sky, Build so many things at such a low cost that are modular so that you can use this platform for a variety of missions that you could literally, paint the sky black. You know what I mean? And the only way we're going to get there is with kind of three key things. One is new approaches to manufacturing. The day of the exquisitely made drone, in my opinion, are numbered. General Atomics and the Reaper is going to have a very, they own that part of the market. They're gonna keep selling birds. We're seeing the Houthis shoot them down now with 50 to 100 thousand dollar missiles. So they're gonna need to stay back and they're going to need to do just like the Ukrainians and Russians are showing us. They need to be the signal relay or the pipe back to the command center. And you're going to need to have a ton, and I mean, like hundreds of smaller, cheaper platforms extending out in front of them, right? That's where the world is going to go. And that's where it needs to go. And because the conflict in Ukraine is showing us that it's changing every couple of weeks. I think, LePlant, yesterday or two days ago, he said, we're seeing EW change every three weeks in Ukraine. And we are not built for that. You need to build systems just like the Ukrainians are building the small drones. We need to do this for the big drones. They need to be modifiable. And for us, that means at Firestorm, it means from propulsion, so a pusher prop that can stay in the air for hours, right? Or it means a jet engine where we can go scream at a hundred to 200 miles an hour and go somewhere really fast and be really torquey to an EDF where we can go like pretty silent, right? That's one part of the modularity, but also from a payload standpoint. I think it's whoever builds a lot of trucks with a really simple integration plan to it and the operating system to make everything work together is going to win because we're already seeing them do that in these disparate little manufacturing cells in Ukraine. We're not seeing that on fixed wing and that's why we've, raised a bunch of money and started to win contracts for that, but it's all about overwhelming. If you overwhelm you control. That is just, I think what's going to happen. I mean, look at the picture behind me, right? How do you shoot all those airplanes down? It's the same exact idea.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the thing we keep reminding ourselves of is that the new status quo that we're talking about here is only 12 months old, and it's not going to remain a constant, just wait two years and see what this, landscape looks like. If people identify that repeaters are a single point of failure, and those are the things to target, then guess what? They're going to be 10x repeaters in the air few months from now. It's constantly adapting. And so, we need to build not for what we see in the battlefield right now, but we need to anticipate another leap in scale coming in, months, not decades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exactly. And what you just said requires us as a country to not be arrogant or the West in general, right? We fought insurgents who had no resources. We're watching the world bifurcate into two camps, and they both have a lot of resources and a lot of intelligence. So, for us, it is payload bay, electronic hookups, a operating system and a universal flight controller for a fixed wing drone, and no arrogance on our side. We just need to make a lot of those and allow you to modify it. We have our preloads, but we need to basically not have that arrogance. And I tell our team almost on a weekly basis, we are in the first inning, if that's the analogy you want to have, or for Luka, maybe we're in the first five minutes of the soccer match, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you.

In other words, in some ways, are you giving up on the technology solution with an overwhelming dumb solution? And if that's, so one, and then number two, if there is going to be a technology change, that obviates the need for overwhelming volume, what would it be?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So some of the more interesting things we've seen out of Ukraine, let me frame it in that debate, cause I think that'll help explain why I think that could, you know, could go either way. Ukrainians are supply chain constrained. They can't put a$2000 NVIDIA chip on every drone they make. So what they've gone and done is they've found a bunch of Texas instrument chips that are$50 that give them a high level of compute that are built in Europe that they can build terminal guidance on. All right. And so you're not needing to do this on an NVIDIA. You can do this on a$50 chip, maybe have a couple of them, okay, so you have some more compute. That's the first step in one of those exquisite technologies, basically being dumbed down and put onto something that is truly disposable. And I think that what we really got to see here is, I think it's going to be a mix of both, if I'm going to be honest. Because even the Ukrainians are telling us why they like our technology is we can make a ton of stuff quickly. So you're going to have to marry the sledgehammer with the sniper rifle, or the shotgun with the sniper and whoever does that in the right way, and that's why we're saying like, Hey, we think that we have some baseline technology that works, but if there's other stuff that's out there, like we will integrate it in days, right? Because we want to be able to provide that overwhelming force with the intelligent capability. Look, you could very well have something that comes out of left field here that totally overwhelms everything we've ever seen and it's like, true neural networked swarms of intelligent drones doing things. For quadcopters, there's some really promising stuff, for fixed wing stuff it's still in development. Right. And we're partnering with a bunch of people to start making these swarms make decisions at a hundred miles an hour, as opposed to 30 or 40, but I don't think we have enough information yet, Jim, to be like, this is what's going to win one way or the other. Is it the sledgehammer or the tech? We're betting that the manufacturing is always going to be a player and so we'd prefer to basically partner with the tech. And so if, and when the killer app is built, we have a way to go field 50, 000 of them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can you paint a picture for how the human operator's role is going to change as the scale of these swarms increases? For instance, in Ukraine today what does a mission look like for a human operator? Does that person manage the drone from launch all the way through to the completion of its mission? That one air vehicle, or is there a lot of handoff going on, and as we head towards bigger and bigger swarms and more complex attacks, how does a team of operators manage a much larger number of drones? What is that going to look like in the future?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's a couple of different pieces to this question. Today, a lot of the teams, you have one person reporting to the people flying the ISR bird with like, hey, this is what I see, and we think it's over in this area. And then you have somebody with a map standing right next to the pilot of the FPV, saying like, oh look, yeah, that tree looks like it should be right there, keep moving to the right, right? Remember,'cause there's no GPS here. I think that with more exquisite kind of systems in the air, like with laser target designators or a way to hand off, terrain mapping features of what this thing saw to another drone. If you could synthesize that, then the drone could figure out where it should be going, will be coming in the next, in a while. Today, the teams really consist of people behind the front lines, controlling and flying the drones, the repeater drones in the air, the ISR drones doing the circling, and then teams that have to sneak up towards the front line to launch the FPV drones, then get out of there before they get shelled, right? So we're talking like eight to 10 person teams. There are expensive versions of that now by Western primes. Too expensive for where the world is going. I think as people develop ultra low cost, I'm talking like, let's call it, a couple million dollars for dozens and dozens of big and small drones that can work together. That's where you need to be going if you want to be competitive with what the Russians and the Chinese and the Iranians will be doing in the future. So the team of the future, we want it to be one or two people, and we want to have kind of systems that can automatically launch and recover, placed in a variety of areas. And a lot of that kind of, without giving too much away, a lot of that feedback comes directly from talking to tons of Ukrainian drone operators and tons of kill teams as they explained to us the tactics that work and how they've had to build them. Fighting with those two baselines we talked about earlier, which is no GPS, and assuming that you only have like 90 seconds, maybe, before they triangulate where you are, and they just whack you with an artillery shell. So it's how do you get the stuff from behind the jamming area, or behind the targeting area, into the area you need to find the targets, either people or vehicles, and then how do you launch the supporting vehicles in a way that doesn't harm, people who have to sneak up to launch it. And we're, we've already won a contract with the Air Force to do a bunch of that, where we're carrying other drones into combat. So now we have ISR and then smaller drones. And so that's one way in which you're starting to see that happen in Ukraine as well. And I'm glad the U S government's really leaning forward with that project here domestically too, because we think that's really important. And, you know, that's one way in which we get to that overwhelming intelligence plus sledgehammer, right? You put a lot of stuff at the edge and maybe some of the smaller things have some really good capability and you have so many of them that who cares if you lose a couple thousand, we've at least identified all the targets we need to go run into and or follow, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How mature are swarming, true swarming operations in Ukraine? And I don't necessarily mean you send more than one drone per operator, but true swarming behavior that's being implemented and how do you overall see, the trajectory of that evolution?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't see them optimizing to it, to be honest, right now. I think they have a system that works and I don't think they feel comfortable with a lot of the technologies that have been developed yet to deploy that out there. I'm just giving you guys like no bullshit when they say to us, do not give us your exquisite stuff, because if it doesn't work on the first or second try, we will literally put it in a garage and start tearing the pieces out of it we want, and we will not fly it. We will cannibalize it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's what we hear. We hear from drone operators that, people throw all kinds of, feature rich, complex, very, shiny products at them. And the feedback that we're getting is, look, I don't think that those people understand the kind of user that is going to put this in their hands. This is a sleep deprived, afraid, stressed, a hundred other things on their mind type of user who just needs very simple buttons.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>8 to 12 hour shifts, right? Every single day, for months, that's who you're dealing with. it, I, Luka, you nailed it. So, like, a couple things need to happen here at the same time across the Western version of our drone industry because I'm going to just collectively put, heh, the bifurcating world is happening, right? We need to make these things super easy to use. And so for us on our team, it's taking the lessons of Citadel for how easy it was to run a counter UAS system, right? Making it look magical on a UI/UX screen, and doing all of the complicated stuff in the background. And we're about to debut our new mission planner where it ingests real world data into a 3d environment with real physics engines and allows you to modify. What do you want to do? Do you want to do an ISR capability? Great. Set up your mission, right? You want to do a loitering strike. Great. Set up your mission. But again, this is V1 of this thing. It's probably already way too complicated than it needs to be. But for us, we see a world where you need to use existing technologies that people have been trained on and make the magic happen in the background so that they can run it on a cell phone or a tablet, something that they're already really familiar with. Right. But, Coming back to your original point, we're hearing the same thing. And I think the problem we've run into, and we have to be very delicate here, the Ukrainians need materials. They are in a life or death struggle. Where they have a problem is that they go, not all the stuff you send us works because it's over complicated and it's not built for a jamming environment, full stop. But it's hard to tell somebody who's giving you a lot of money that you don't like what they have. Now they've gotten better in the last year of saying, this is the type of stuff we want. And if you guys look at the Wall Street Journal, I'm not going to name anybody, we've been hearing this for a year of companies that have sent tens, hundreds, maybe a billion dollars of product over there that when we go over there, we see them in warehouses, full stop, right? And that's material. And all they're asking for and what they like about Firestorm, and I don't mean to just keep plugging it, but we are listening to the customer, they're like, we need a system that has propulsion, that's modular and that we can easily get into and modify. That's what they need. Cause that's what they're having to use constantly on the battlefield. Right. You modify stuff.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's the greatest limiting factor of this let's say high technology that's being sent to them? What are the biggest reasons it's not working for them? So one, you said it's a jamming environment. It doesn't seem like these people are anticipating the jamming environment. Number two, you mentioned these people are sleep deprived. They don't have the mental awareness that's needed to be able to operate these. What else is the fault of the billion dollars of technology that's being sent over, that's not working for them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How it's built. It's not built to be modified. Like literally changing a nose cone is not modular. Need to be able to get in there. You need to be able to put bigger payloads in. You need to put smaller payloads in. That stuff's really important. Change comm systems. These are hard problems. We understand this is a marathon, right? And we understand that we can't do everything. We're very, egoless over here about where we are as a business. We're a young drone manufacturer, but we listened to the end customer that says like, look, have your build outs, but have it be able to be modified. And there has been some disconnect between what the U. S. is funding and what the Ukrainians are asking for. And it's a very delicate situation because you don't want to like, do you know what I mean? Like it's hard when someone gives you a lot of money to tell them like, Hey, we don't want that. Right? But you are having people in the U. S. government, like LaPlante, come out and openly say, we gave them all these GPS guided artillery shells, none of them work. You know what I mean? And then there's a couple Wall Street Journals UAVs that are not working.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dan, what are you hearing from end users in the battlefield, as it relates to existing, call it workflow, call it kill chain, but what parts of that workflow are still manual, difficult, time consuming? On the one hand, what we hear is that for instance, the target detection or the ISR bird that's looking out for targets of opportunity that on the one hand, it feels like that is something that could be somewhat easily automated, but when you actually talk to the people who are on the battlefield, you realize that this is still a very manual, far from being automated, part of that workflow. What other things are you hearing that people are having most problems with?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, look, What I think you're going to see in the next two years, and I'm just going to say like where I think it's going and it will show where I think a lot of these pieces will be automated. You're seeing like ground robots in cars, right? A lot of money. A lot of talent has gone and worked in that space over the last, what, decade, probably, as we've started to use computer vision to solve real problems. And guys, I have a four year old Tesla. There's two parts of my drive where it still can't determine something and it freaks out a little bit. So we're not there on that stuff, but there's hundreds of millions or billions of hours now of video where these models can go and learn, right? We don't have that yet for UAVs. The Ukrainians are building that. They have tons and tons of footage, but I think that's going to help with automatic target recognition and then terminal guidance, honestly. And you're starting to see some of that stuff pop up on GitHub. Which means I think a lot of that stuff will be commoditized over the next couple of years as you build the right kind of data training pipelines on that stuff. And I think that there's opportunities for Western governments to work together to collaboratively build some of these models and then to figure out how to run them at the edge with very low power. Do you know what I mean? so that's one area. So let's call that the kind of target, recognition. I think the second area, which has been just fascinating to me is you talk to some of the guys who run deep strike okay. So we're talking like hundreds and hundreds of miles or, a thousand kilometers. Right. And, They will literally have someone flying with a map next to them, right? A map on a phone and they are doing visual identification,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>dead reckoning,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>reckoning. it's.

And they're like, well, cause it's, again, maybe we're in the third inning of the ball game, not in the first inning, but it's coming along, but then there's some also really interesting non visual, INS stuff that's out there. We've seen, we're integrating one of them right now that we're pretty excited about, that we are being told by end users is very successful out there, and it does not use GPS, which is interesting. But I think you're going to see multiple little bites to be taken out of like where you need a human to solve a problem, right? And I think it's going to be a lot of little steps every week, will result in like a year from now, we'll be like, May 1st of 25, we're going to be like, Oh my goodness, can you believe we had 10 person drone kill teams? And we had, a guy looking at a map on his phone or tablet trying to figure out where he was. And we had, a drone not being able to coordinate with another drone, what to go run into. Do you know what I mean? Something like that. I think some of that stuff's coming. They don't actively talk about the need for a swarm, which is very interesting because the swarm dominates our conversation here. We talk about drone swarms all the time, both from a national security perspective and what we need to build. They're just like, well, there's a lot of targets and there's a lot of data we have to crunch. Let's just be smart and get stuff out there and then solve the problem. Because the humans still make better decisions because they've been trained at this point, right? So, I, and I don't think that goes away anytime soon, but in the next couple of years, maybe you have something where you're simplifying the decision making process for, is this a friend or a foe or a threat?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned two assumptions that people are taking as table stakes: no GPS, and then, jammers and direction finders everywhere. What other assumptions both the users and people who are providing technologies to those users should anticipate in the future of drone warfare, and especially from the perspective of a founder, right, or an investor where you want to, build products that have relevance in the years to follow and in an environment that changes so rapidly, what additional assumptions do you think that are safe to make? Arguably you're talking mass and modularity and production. what else? And what are the trade offs?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think you should be trying to build everything to be future proof, right? And the problem is that when you go, what I mean by that, of course, is leading into modularity and like the ability to rapidly change\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you say everything? Sorry. Is that like vertically integrated end to end, or do you have something else in mind?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Yeah. More, more along the lines of that type of vertical integration, right? We have six or seven propulsion systems we use, and that's because I just have concerns about supply chain for everything. I do think some things like sensors and cameras and radios, I think over the next couple of years, I have less concern about that kind of being decoupled. I think there's enough demand now, from China. Right. But what I would say is this is where the problem is because the U.S. DoD is not built to buy modular stuff. It just is not, it's used to buying a SKU. And so if you're going to look at the war in Ukraine, we need to really think about how do we align the incentives for the procurer and then the entrepreneur to solve that problem. And it's really tough. And so for us it means buying a lot of time and raising a lot of money and selling the stuff to a variety of folks to buy that time, because I do believe it will catch up because there's no other way we're going to fight the conflicts of the future. Right, because of the jamming and the GPS, that's just like the start of the table stakes, but the issues I think founders are going to face is if you're building really cool software or one piece of the puzzle, if you do not have a platform to put it on, it is very hard to find customers. And I think that, again, everything, including drones, is going to be commoditized over the next four to five years. So you have to have a business model where you can build lots of stuff, put it on things to basically get it into the fight, and, and still be able to make money. Right.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. and that's critical and sorry to interrupt, but, you're raising a really important point because traditionally, people associate big moats, with some single piece of really interesting proprietary technology. But if you're moving towards a world where a lot of the products that work are actually very simple, very affordable things that you need to be able to produce at volume. If you're trending towards this model, which, broadly is commoditized hardware, then innovating on the business model, on some of the other dimensions really becomes the key source of, defensibility for founders, which is a different way of thinking about ensuring this defensibility of the business.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Totally. And I think that means then as founders, you have to look at markets outside of the U.S. as well. We're addicted to buying big, expensive things. The Marine Corps just bought 450 million of product that you can go read the Wall Street Journal to see how it's performing in Ukraine. That was a week ago. I mean, we're, again, we're addicted to doing this. In the world I see it, and why we brought Lockheed Martin on as an investor early, the big guys know how the game works. And defense is exclusionary by nature. The world, if we're going to be successful, is small companies working with big companies to effect change within the Department of Defense. And the same thing needs to happen with our allies around the world, These big defense companies exist because they've been a very secure way to build big cold war types of systems. And so the systems have been built to protect them and keep them in business so that if conflict breaks out, you have the ability to scale exquisite systems. The world is just changing, right? Again, you can go watch my LinkedIn. I do this a couple times a week where I show a thousand dollar system blowing up a multi million dollar system. We're talking millions of dollars of ROI on small drones knocking out armored vehicles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You've made comments on Replicator recently. So what should change as it relates to Replicator based on what you're talking about right now?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We, look, I commend Doug Beck and the DIU team for getting in front of this. I think the key thing is going to be, and I think what all of industry and Congress is asking for is to take risks so that we keep doing things the way we have done them. And what I mean by that is how do we build more of stuff faster? That's the key. The delivery delays are just too long for a lot of the big more exquisite systems. And you're looking at Ukraine with 10, 000 people making 10, 000 plus drones a month. And I'm not saying that everything needs to be FPV, but that should be helping you dictate where you go with this side with this and the problem we're going to run into, it's like, so say DIU funds, the start, who's going to fund it after that? Right? That's the big problem we're going to see, I think, on some of this stuff. I'm not worried about where does the first tranche of cash come from? I'm worried about where does it go longer term? Because again, to become a program of record you need money. You need palm cycle there's all of these things that kind of prevent that from happening. And, I want to make sure we're taking risks now, cause in the scheme of things, a billion dollars that they have to spend is nothing for the DoD, right? This is where you should be really risky in my opinion. But it can be really hard for people to, not push the easy button and just buy more of all the people they know\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We talked about some of the technologies that are on the horizon, namely, automating certain aspects of the kill chain and the swarming behaviors. But is there something that you are particularly excited about, that you're seeing on the horizon or something that you would point our entrepreneurial audience to go and innovate in and solve.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the more we can bring in human and machine teaming to the decision making in the build up, to running a mission, the better. You know what I mean? I'll just leave it broad like that, but a lot of data goes into like, where do we spend our resources and where do we put things in the air? There's a lot of interesting technologies now you can fuse from satellite images, to weather data, to terrain, to news that's happening, like all of that stuff is out there. And if you can synthesize it to help you make better decisions for where you should fly your systems, I think that's going to be, play a huge role over the next 10 years, right? Like go run 50,000, 100,000 it's like the General Mattis, right? I want my soldiers to run, 50 bloodless battles before they go into combat. Well, 50 sounds light. Let's go run 50, 000 scenarios before we go in and do something. I think that's where this is going to get really interesting because that data can then feed what type of platform you put in the air and what type of payload you put on the platform. Some of the more interesting startups I've seen that have thought about this in a variety of ways have gone after kind of the data problems that those things will require. That's a really unique way to tackle something that both the primes, small businesses, and the government would probably all pay a license for\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dan, what about use cases on the commercial side of things? You've been in this industry for a while. what are your thoughts on the major demand and supply forces at play here?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm bullish on components and basically the decoupling of the supply chain. It's a little bit of chicken and egg. Everyone's like, well, do you ban DJIs? Does that then kill the whole drone industry? Does that jumpstart the domestic stuff? We're seeing NDAA compliant pieces and products go to Mexico. There's a robust supply chain being built in Vietnam. Okay. Cause don't forget guys, before the Vietnam war, the Chinese are their enemy, their generational enemy. Right. And they did fight a war after the Vietnam war with them. And they have really good manufacturing technologies there. I think that, as more of the beyond visual line of sight stuff kind of gets ironed out here, you're starting to see people over the last couple of years, starting to get waivers. I think the future is autonomous. I think you're going to see more and more human and machine teaming. And a good thesis has always been like, what can you do, or what can you put on a drone so that you don't have to fly a And we see a lot of helicopters flying over power lines where I live in Southern California, looking at stuff. I think that's a good use case for drones. You're seeing a bunch of these drone first responders software companies come out where they're like, hey, we'll build a whole management solution. But again, I think for a lot of the different stuff, it's going to be, you have to commoditize the prices of it. And that's where this thing gets really tricky because to force a change you got to have something either one, be very expensive to force someone to change their behavior. Or two, you have to offer an overwhelming product. And I think that some of the stuff's really good. Like you're seeing a lot of drones being used in ag because, there's less people working in ag. So that's a natural kind of replacement, if you will, of humans. I still think we're probably five or 10 years away from like mass adoption for these systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I want to ask you about the supply chain. We have talked in the past about that and you mentioned that you're less concerned today than you were, say, a year or two years ago in terms of the ability to source some of these critical components. Any additional light that you can shine on the state of the supply chain and how disadvantaged is the Western supply chain still to the consumer electronics supply chain coming out of China?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. It's very disadvantaged. If you guys have ever been to Southern China. If you want to build a product, they have their almost internal Amazon, you can say, hey, I need 10 of these motors and they'll show up that afternoon. It's incredible. And you can start testing them. And a lot of that is just Southern China was the factory of the world for the last 20 years. So it's going to take some time, but look, NDAA compliance, a desire to move away from just the reliance on China for everything is happening not just here, but around the world and I will just say, like, at Exponential last week, I was really impressed by how many products are saying we're either moving out or we're already out of China. It's fascinating. So, I think it's just a trend that continues and maybe that makes some of the subsystems more expensive in the short term, but in the long term, I think, look, as things move out of China, everything's going to get more expensive. That's, let's just be honest, but I think you're seeing a lot of the kind of manufacturing supply chain be rewritten. Living in San Diego, you guys would not believe how much construction is happening right at the border or right over the border. It's millions of square feet of manufacturing is going on there as companies near shore. So, I think that's a trend that just continues.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any parting thoughts for the audience or advice for entrepreneurs or, otherwise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's an interesting time in the world.

That's just, a general thought. And then for the entrepreneurs, in my opinion, it's always been like find a hole and then jump in with two feet to try and fill it.

So I think we may see some pricing innovations come out of the commercial sector. And I think we may also see what I have mentally been referring to is like Kirkland brand options for drone components.

So this is a discussion around the evolving role of UAS in warfare, including in Ukraine. The critical role of the supply chain to ensure we can properly engage in when those wars, and the recent announcement of the U S Replicator Initiative. What it is. Why it happened and what it is intended to achieve. So Kara immediately jumps into the fragility of our UAS supply chain. Something we've talked a lot about over the last couple of years, but she says that with all of the talk and awareness, not much has really been done about it relating to our preparation for UAS in warfare. And speaking of vulnerable supply chains, we discuss how batteries essential to UAS and UAS warfare are often sourced in China. Speaking of vulnerabilities. Then we enter a very cool discussion that the outcome of future wars, as Peter says, may revolve around high volume electronics. And how lethality is coming in, smaller, smaller packages and where the need for secure supply chains becomes perhaps even more important. We discuss the state of the UAS market, particularly defense in UAS and especially around mass. How many drones can you produce and field? How quickly can you scale what's needed to maintain scale? And lastly, how would you rise to meet that demand? Kara discusses, how mass is achieved and how DOD is forecasting orders is the greatest limiting factor and how even large businesses can't invest without effective DOD forecasting requirements. Without the forecast and the requirements that businesses can't and won't justify investments to meet that future demand. And to achieve mass we have to lower the cost and to lower the cost we may have to have an established electronic space and today's BOM or bill material is four to five times higher than equivalent Chinese drones. We discuss the impact of Ukraine on UAS and the impact it's having on our vision of future wars. I really like Luka's question about air superiority. And the role of UAS and that you may never really have air superiority, as long as UAS exists in the battlefield. And we discuss contested logistics, how to get the supplies out to the time and place of need. What a shift from previous conflicts where in future conflicts, like in Ukraine, It's going to be very challenging to have complete air superiority. This is one of my favorite, what I consider to be most relevant parts of the podcast. Then we discuss DOD's Replicator Initiative and what drove its birth, how it surprised industry, how it will leverage unmanned systems to prepare for mass and how it's meant to address the growing threat from China. We discussed the need to move from exquisite group five drones to high volume, high attrition, UAS vehicles. And another great section we discussed startups, listen to what Kara says are their advantages and what she said should be the focus areas for startups. And a really interesting section around counter UAS, the market size, the lack of a real leader and the real demand. Finally listen to what Kara sees as the future of warfare and her advice to you our entrepreneurs.

We're excited to talk to you today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I'm excited to, be here today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's the one thing that few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One thing that few people agree with me on, I'm not sure I have that many original thoughts, but I would say one of the things that I think about way more often than others is the fragility of our, supply chain specifically for UAS, but also other, defense applications. I think about the fact that all of our edge computing comes from one single foundry in Taiwan, all of our NVIDIA chips, and that we, as we're thinking about preparing for the next great power conflict, we haven't thought enough about diversifying away from that, the one, there's one specific boundary in Taiwan. So that's, I think one thing people don't agree with me on is that fixation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Has it changed at all in the last couple of years, based on the reality of the supply chain\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think COVID woke folks up to how fragile the supply chain can actually be. It was even something as simple as consumers not being able to get toilet paper. I think it was an eye opening experience for folks when they start thinking about supply chains for critical weapon systems that have one, maybe two provider of a part that it will not operate without. I think COVID 19 made it real. But what I haven't seen is, I've seen a lot of discussions around how we're going to make it better, but I haven't seen a whole lot of action on it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When did you begin to form that view and what keyed you into it first?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what actually keyed me into it is it was back when I was at a company called Thomson Reuters. so Thomson Reuters is a Canadian data company. they own Reuters News and a whole bunch of other Data sources, you probably have no idea, roll up under them. While I was there, I was doing some work for, the defense department looking at supply chains for GPUs, graphical processing units, and that's when I first realized how many just critical components for weapons systems were coming out of TSMC, which is a foundry in Taiwan. And you'd see fluctuations in the GPU market caused by video game popularity. And then you'd see cryptocurrency would rise, and then that would put a strain on GPUs as well. And then folks in the military could not get what they needed because of a really popular video game. And that's when I started to really realize how fragile this could be and what a risk this is creating for us, especially as we're looking at the future of warfare that is largely focused on that exact geographic region.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Yes. And what you bring up, really pulls forward some historical lessons in modern warfare. If we look back over the last century, take World War II as an example, like many modern wars, it was ultimately decided by the strength of the respective industrial bases in the countries that were fighting and the U. S. had, I think an advantage going in with the automotive industry that it had already built and the mass production capacity that was throughout the supply chain in the U. S. And if what we're looking at here in this, next iteration of warfare is that the aspects of the industrial base that will be decisive are around, let's call it high volume electronics and the semiconductors that drive them. Then, I don't think that the U. S. has anything resembling leadership in that, I think that a lot of that capacity has, over the last 30 years, really developed in Asia. And so for us to, change that as a country and our industrial base, it's not something that we can just say, hey, we need this and a year later, it shows up. Would you agree with that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, I would absolutely agree with that. And especially with the rising demand for what folks are calling attritable assets in the battlefield.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's only going to put more pressure on the supply chain when you can't cannibalize old systems for parts to keep the new systems in the fight. How will the supply chain keep up with that? How can you price that to be a attritable when there's one specific semiconductor on there that just, you can't get right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think we're seeing, lethality show up in smaller and smaller packages in modern warfare and what we're learning from the conflict in Ukraine, and we're seeing, looking ahead, more and more automation being built into weapon systems and certainly the Chinese are developing, what you might call truly autonomous weapon systems. But to whatever degree that you decide to imbue that automation into these systems, it gives anyone the opportunity to really scale it out and have very high volumes of systems on the battlefield. And just the numerical scale of it can be an overwhelming and decisive factor. If that's the way things play out in the future, then, from our standpoint, where are we going to develop the capacity in the manufacturing base to deliver that scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Kara you're not saying that people necessarily disagree with you on this point, before you answer Peter's question. It's more, people may not be as aware of the vulnerability of the supply chain. And it directly relates to, military use of drones, for example, as Peter's referring to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. Because it's one of those pieces that folks look at, they look at the drone and they think of that as a commercial part that goes in there as something you can go on your computer and you can order, it just comes. in the mail for you. It's not something you're going to consider, like a critical component until you can't get it or until the price skyrockets because there's such a shortage in what's available. And what we were talking about with the autonomy piece and trying to push autonomy out en masse, our policy dictates that we need to have a human in the loop for anything that's going to be regarding lethality. Which means for a human to be in the loop there needs to be a video feed so they can make that determination. And that video feed is going to require edge processing of some kind. And that's where you're going to hit that, you're going to hit that roadblock every time. But my other truly controversial, people don't agree with me on this, I think that our policy around the human in the loop limitation will only last as far as, the first few days of a peer adversary conflict.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interesting. play that scenario out for us, Kara, will you?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, based on what you can read in the news, you have a pretty good idea that our adversaries are not limited by the same policies around your AI and your lethality decisions. And so you're talking about meeting a peer or near peer adversary out in mass when they're not limited by the same restriction. And you're talking about fielding thousands of autonomous systems at once in swarms? And you need to keep a human in the loop for every single decision that involves a kinetic effect. It just, it's hard to imagine how that's going to scale well, and how we're going to remain committed to that policy, as we engage in, or hopefully never engage in a conflict like that. But if we were to, I don't think it would happen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If it's in the opening days of the war, where there's only one side in a certain direction you can have a, quote, kill box and instruct the autonomous systems to engage whatever is past a certain boundary, but once the troops start mixing, then this becomes a lot more complicated scenario to, work through.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I agree completely. It becomes almost dystopian to think about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the supply chain fragility topic, besides the video links, what other specific UAS components do you think are most impacted?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Probably batteries. So I've been in the UAS industry for not as long as most people, but for a while. And one of the hardest pieces to source that doesn't touch China is batteries. And when, especially when you're talking about small, attritable UAS, they're going to be operating off batteries to be likely sourced from China. So as soon as that would be shut off, that would be problematic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's zoom out a little bit and just, share your perspectives on the market. Describe the state of the UAS market today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure, I'd be happy to. So most of my statements are going to be focused more on that defense part of the market, not commercial. So the biggest focus of the market that I'm seeing right now is around mass, is how many can you produce, how quickly can you field that, and a lot of that's driven by the conflicts overseas. So Ukraine is a huge demand signal for systems. It's also a proving ground for new technology, and it's been, a time where you can see innovation happening in real time in a way that we haven't had that ability to do so. And then you're also seeing. You're seeing people, like, the situation in Israel and Gaza, you're seeing our allies going through their reserves, and you're seeing how quickly that can happen. So you're feeling, in the industry, you're feeling a lot of that demand of how quickly could you scale, what would be required to maintain that scale, and some, almost like an excitement, but also a little bit of trepidation around how you would rise to meet that demand. Also seeing a lot of, push towards the smaller systems that have a higher level of endurance. That's a challenge for both physics and power, but that's been a kind of, a rising trend in the drone industry. It's almost as popular now, in my vision, than the eVTOL space that you've seen with the Air force's Agility Prime and all the providers around that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the topic of mass, how do you think this is achieved? Where do you see the limiting factor? Is it in the, parts as we discussed just moments ago, or is it in manufacturing processes to accommodate that level of low cost and production at scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in my viewpoint, it boils down to forecasting orders. That's the biggest limfac for the industry rising to meet the challenge of mass is that there's a lot of discussion around how we will achieve mass, what kind of manufacturing facilities we need it. But the truth is that's well within America's wheelhouse to rise to meet that challenge. But even large businesses can't invest in the facilities and start to manufacture at that scale until they have at least a few years of forecasted orders coming in from the government that would allow them to make that investment. And so that creates a catch 22 where, the government may not be ready to put in those orders because what would they do with that mass if they didn't need it and that industry can't prepare at risk because they don't have any certainty on it, and they either have to answer to their investors and their board, or they have to answer to their shareholders about how they're managing that fiduciary responsibility. But it also means we will be in a situation where we'll likely have to try to scale really quickly when the time does need it, unless the government invests in it ahead of time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, in your mind, for a country to deliver that type of mass, how important or helpful is it, for that country to already have a domestic consumer electronics industry that is enabling high volume production, of related types of products. Is that really a requirement in order to be able to turn and have the industrial base deliver high volumes of these types of systems?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In my opinion, yes, absolutely, because to, to achieve mass, you have to lower the cost. And a big part of lowering the cost is using as many commercially available parts as possible in your system. And those commercially available parts have to be available to you. You can't have a six month lead time for the electronics that are going to go into your system. Because those lead times build upon themselves. And all of a sudden you have this attritable mass that will be available in the next 12 to 36 months, which potentially is not as helpful as we'd like.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what do you see as the state of the consumer electronics industrial base in the U. S. and, how far away is it from, being able to support the type of demand in the military space that we're looking at?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know that I would call myself an expert on the consumer electronics industry, domestically, I will say that, generally speaking, in my experience, you end up having to seek out the best performance for the dollar in order to meet your obligation to the government, as well as to the taxpayer. And that, generally speaking, isn't always going to be domestic. Unless there's a regulation that's blocking you and forcing you to go domestic, you will be, in general, trading off performance to stay domestic. And so I think until that gap is closed and the domestic electronics perform the same way, it's going to be, it's going to be a limfac for us.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>19:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I've heard, anecdotal accounts of, people who are doing systems integration, to build domestically sourced drone platforms. And they've related to me that to build something with equivalent capability to a Chinese drone, the bill of materials is four to five times more than what that Chinese drone costs. And so if we were to think about domestically building up an industrial base that had the depth and that therefore could be cost competitive, is there a way to do it that bypasses already having a consumer electronics manufacturing base in the country? Is there a way to do it as you talk about, working with allied partners or building that capacity in another fashion?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My theory is that we'd likely have to work with allied partners to get to the point where we would be anywhere close to the cost of Chinese made parts. I mean, there's a reason why you're not buying an iPhone made in California. You wouldn't like that price, and it may not work the same way your previous iPhones did, and even if you could achieve the same performance the price is going to be well past what you would consider reasonable to spend. So, if you have a system, a UAS system, that is completely NDA compliant, meets all the blue list and green list requirements, it's not going to cost anywhere close to your DJI type equivalent, even if the performance is equivalent. And that is the price that the government has to pay right now, and it is one of the, it's one of the stumbling blocks for achieving mass, is that, we've set up a situation where even hundreds of millions of dollars isn't going to get you the same mass that a hundred millions of dollars for another country would.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And, numerically, what do you think of in terms of, being mass? Is it a thousand? Is it 10, 000? Is it a million? and looking at, Ukraine perhaps as an example that gives us some kind of bedrock off of which to think about this, what do you see as the level of mass in these systems that is going to deliver, an advantage on the battlefield?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I love that question. How would I define mass is right up there with how I would define attritable. It's going to depend, largely, and there is no definition that everyone's going to agree to. I think for what we're generally speaking about mass would be in the hundreds. We don't have any systems that I'm aware of that we could do in the thousands or ten thousands, or at least it wouldn't come from, one provider because of the cost would just be really prohibitive to do that. And in Ukraine, you're able to achieve mass with hundreds, but you're also facing a high degree of attrition. Which is to be expected in a conflict. And so part of, the math is just keeping the water at the same line as when you started, even if there's a leak at the bottom of the cup.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>22:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Kara, one of your earlier comments where you were saying that there's difficulty in forecasting demand. I mean, even in light of the kinds of attrition that we're hearing is happening in Ukraine and how little, arsenal the West, especially in Europe, seems to be having right now. Even in light of that, there is, you're saying, uncertainty or unwillingness to forecast demand with some certainty.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>22:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. There absolutely is that. Because there is uncertainty around the continuity of the funding being an even flow. So, in order to be prepared to build a stockpile, that would be an investment the government has to make. Companies themselves generally do not stockpile systems at all. They're just going to have exactly as much as what's ordered and any spares associated. They're not going to have anything extra that would be laying around unless the government instructed them to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, we're just coming off a podcast talking about eVTOLs with Dr. Manning and Dr. Bourdain, and we've been talking about autonomy with eVTOLs and AAM. Set the stage for us a little bit of what's driving the demand for mass what's happening with Ukraine that is different than we saw a year ago, let's say. And then second, how is this translating what's going on with Gaza right now?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I love that question, and I would say that from my viewpoint, what's driving the demand for mass is actually coming out of the Indo Pacom area more than anything. that's where that drive is coming from. Indo Pacom is going to be your Asia Pacific region of the world, and that region is defined by this, what is affectionately called a tyranny of distance. Meaning you aren't going to be able to have a central base, you're not going to be able to quickly resupply, you're not going to have runways necessarily, and there is just going to be a significant amount of inescapable maritime factors in whatever you have going on. So a lot of that focus on mass is looking at that tyranny of distance and imagining that you're across this great, vast expanse and you're also in an area where you maybe do not have traditional communication means available to you, the navigation would be limited, but you still need to conduct operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Given that we have the problems we have today in meeting the demand, were we anticipating this a year or two ago? Has Ukraine changed our view at all? Has what's gone in Gaza changed? Or is it still an Asian focus and Ukraine has had little impact?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>25:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think Ukraine's been hugely impactful for understanding how important unmanned systems will be in the current and the coming conflicts. I've heard folks refer to Ukraine as the drone war, where it's the first war where we're having drones versus drones happening in the battlefield. We saw lots of drone operations happening in Afghanistan and Iraq, but it was normally just we were using drones, and we weren't seeing folks using them against us in the same way we are in Ukraine. In Ukraine, you're seeing Russia using loitering, munitions. You're seeing Ukrainians use loitering, munitions, and you're seeing that signal jamming going back and forth and then the Ukrainians are having to adapt on the fly to, to be able to still operate and keep their assets in the air.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>25:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's been the biggest lesson learned from the war in Ukraine and how drones are used there for you personally, Kara?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the biggest lessons learned. It's probably the importance of having more drone operators in these militaries is that Ukraine has done a great job on ramping up on having their training catch up. But that's been one of the things that they've had to catch up on is having enough people who can operate the drones because the U. S. can drop off a Connex box full of them. But if they don't know how to operate it, then it's not going to be useful to them. So I think having that training tail be ahead of conflicts is probably one of the biggest lessons learned.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the types of drones that the Ukrainians have had the most success with or that are in the most numerous use on the part of the Ukrainians?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know that I can answer that definitively. I think most of it is going to be in that sensitive information category. to plug AeroEnvironment, I would say that they've been having a lot of luck using the Switchblades in the engagements. It's one of the unmanned systems that you're going to see referred to often in publications. And that's because the loitering munitions are pretty ideal for this type of conflict because they can stay up in the air for up to 25 minutes. And then they have that kinetic impact as well that it's providing, like, close air support without needing actual close air support in the battlefield.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One thing that the war in Ukraine highlighted from the get go is the need for air superiority which has been absent and therefore resulted in the kind of trench warfare that we're seeing. Now, it seems like that concept is extending to the realm of drones as well. So it seems like going forward, especially in these kinds of operational scenarios, there's no true air superiority if you also cannot protect the skies from drones. So how do you think air superiority will be achieved in a world where a few hundred dollar drones can be sent up, en masse, and disrupt, lines, make everything visible. There's no safe haven anymore. You can't maneuver with the kinds of vehicles that you're used to maneuvering because you'll be picked up very easily by a surveillance drone that's just, saturating the front lines. How does air superiority get achieved in a world that looks like that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think air superiority is going to end up looking almost like an arms race between UAS and counter UAS. Meaning, I think that you're going to see a prevalence of unmanned systems making a real impact in a conflict, and then you're going to see a meteoric rise of a specific counter UAS technology that is then neutralizing that. And then you're going to see the UAS innovation catch up and figure out a way to operate around that. So you're going to see a ping pong back and forth between counter UAS, and UAS, capabilities. I don't think you'll ever achieve full air dominance in the battlefield as long as there are unmanned systems. There's always going to be one, that's either, smaller, flies lower, flies higher, you fill in the blank. They're always going to get some through. It's more going to be about trying to achieve dominance versus, like, absolute conquest.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Peter today, sent us an article by Ian Lovett from the Wall Street Journal that talked about the impact of drones on even logistics, as you were, mentioning Kara. I mean, it's amazing to think that the, the combatants in Ukraine can't even be bringing forward supplies in the vehicles they traditionally brought them forward with because of the use of drones. And they can pick up on the different vehicles and the, I mean, you talk about air superiority, the impact that drones has even on the supply chain and the devastating effect it can be if you don't have a secure supply chain or logistical tail, that's amazing, what are your perspectives on that? Are you surprised by it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, I'm not surprised at all. In the DoD, it's commonly just referred to as contested logistics, right? And that's a huge pain point. It's how are you going to get the supplies out to the time and place of need. Because we can't send the warfighter out and think that we can't resupply them. And the thought of not being able to do that, I think is a paradigm shift for our military. In our past conflicts, we've not had points in time traditionally, there's always going to be exceptions. We haven't had points in time where we can't get supplies out to the warfighter. And we're preparing for a conflict where it may be very challenging to do that. And we may have to use alternative methods for it. And that's where another use case for UAS is providing contested logistics of having an unmanned system bring forward MREs, bring forward water, bring forward ammunition to a place that we can't get a vehicle or a manned aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because the combatant drone knocked out your supply chains.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exactly. And having an unmanned system do contested logistics means that if it went down, all you're losing are the supplies on it. You're not losing any human life. So that's going to be, I think, really critical in future fights.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What this points me towards is, in this game of one upmanship between UAS and counter UAS, it seems that mass itself can play a big role at each iteration of that game, where, someone will choose to counter the other system by simply producing, huge scale numbers of their system. And especially as we move towards systems that have less and less human involvement. the ability to do that scale up becomes even more and more feasible. So, it points towards an inevitability, number one, of moving humans out of the loop in these systems. whether people are comfortable with it or not. One side or the other is going to go in that direction. And it also points towards something decisive in the battle being a high volume production capability to produce things throughout the war effort and not just prior to the war. Because as we're observing, these are really rapidly evolving technologies. They change throughout the conflict and thus they don't have a really long shelf life. So it really points towards cheap, high scale, immediate production capability as one of the ingredients going into this conflict that it helps either side play this type of a game.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that cheap, quick aspect of it, I think, is a challenge for our military. Because when you think cheap and good, you're going to have a really hard time finding something that's NDA compliant. Because that's going to push you more towards the drones you can buy at Walmart, right? But there's always going to be American innovation. They don't all have to be small aerial systems. We've seen some really exciting innovations coming out of the Navy's Task Force 59, where they want to run demos on a shoestring budget. And they're just using a commercial boat and they just modified it to be unmanned, an unmanned surface vessel. You have even older drones that are fielded program of records that's just a software update to push those to be fully autonomous. So we aren't limited by new purchases only. And everything doesn't have to be the quintessential small quadcopter, I think a lot of it's going to involve thinking about something from a different angle to get to that true mass that we're looking for.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It really does require new thinking because it is, in some ways at odds with the ways that we've developed and procured military hardware in recent decades, where we've opted for more lethal, more expensive systems that we perhaps possess in fewer numbers than the previous generation. And other types of munitions we've been able to stockpile over long periods of time. For instance, 155 millimeter shells, you can stockpile those for 30 years and still employ them with effectiveness in the battlefield. But if the munitions, if the expendable high scale items that you bring into the conflict have this degree of intelligence and behavior built into them, they have a shorter shelf life. And so those two factors are both changing as we look at, the lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, and as we look ahead to a future conflict. It's really bringing home the deep implications of this for what we emphasize in future procurement.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And, the Boneyard in Davies Monthan comes to mind as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For repurposing some of that. Kara, what are you hearing from defense customers? What are things that they care about the most? You mentioned the Switchblade, but can you peel that onion a couple layers and talk about the specific capabilities? Is it the robustness to jamming? Is it GPS denied navigation? Is it autonomous features?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in true DoD fashion, it's going to be, they want all of it. That's generally what I hear from the customers is they want something that has a long endurance. It can go up in the air for a while. They want something that has crystal clear ISR. They want something that can operate in a GPS denied or contested environment. And they want it really cheap. That's generally what they want. But you get to pick just a few of those characteristics. I'm also seeing a demand for things that can be passively placed as well. So systems that don't need to be handled as often and they can be, left in place for use later. I'm also seeing a demand for systems that operate off a common ground control station. And so instead of a warfighter having to have multiple apps in order to control systems, it's being able to have a more single, point of contact for controlling systems. And when you start thinking, everyone loves the word swarm. When you start thinking about swarms, it's how on earth would a single operator control multiple systems, especially if they all come from different providers, which likely they should. That's likely because you want folks that are really good at what they do. You don't want one company making every single drone on the battlefield. So we need those to all be able to work together in a single interface that the warfighter can interact with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are you talking about the, I don't know what the acronym is, RAC2 or SCI initiatives in the Army, or is it something else that you're referring to?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's just broader in the idea that even if you took it away from the DoD and you looked at something like Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol, they're using well over 10 different providers for drones at the border. And so those have to have a commonality for use, because you can't have every single officer be trained on every single type of drone, and the interface can't be completely different. So just a broader, interoperability versus a specific initiative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Kara, how do you see the status of the counter UAS capabilities in the battlefield? And what is the source for the massive attrition that we're seeing in Ukraine?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the status of the counter UAS is that we need more soldier borne options is that we can't have counter UAS that's tied to a specific location. And I think we're not seeing attrition solely from counter UAS in Ukraine. I think we're also seeing it through your other options like system failure or kinetics from the counterparts are taking them down, but for counter UAS, I think that the market's going to see a really intense focus on pushing innovation in that area, and that innovation is going to probably not get a break from that push for a while because they're going to need to keep pace with what's coming out of the UAS market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you see UAS as having the edge over counter UAS currently?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I do. I do because I think a lot of counter UAS has been focused on a small, very small drone swarm. They haven't been focusing on larger drones as often that I've seen, unless it's just not available out in the news. And so there aren't going to be as many things they can take down from a counter UAS standpoint that are going to take down like a Group 3. You're going to have to resort back to traditional military means of taking down an aircraft, which is likely going to require a cost that's multitudes higher than the cost of that airframe. And we're seeing that in Ukraine as well, where Russia's putting up systems that are, really cheap, probably wouldn't even fly five more missions after that, but it costs 50, 000 to bring it down. Because there isn't going to be a counter UAS method to bring them down, other than ammunition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If Ukraine is losing 10, 000 drones a month, how is it losing them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's going to be losing a lot of them either from counter UAS, from the adversary, or it's gonna be losing them. So one of the things that they count in that are gonna be things like loitering munitions are gonna count, but that loss is actually very intentional. It's not meant to come back. So anything that's a kamikaze drone, that will be counted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If a lot of the demand is coming from the military use of drones, where the path to market is a lot quicker, what do you think is the impact on the commercial market. And specifically here I'm thinking about creating these attritable systems with components that don't require the kind of robustness that you would want to see in a drone that's used in a commercial, use case. So if most industry resources are funneled into a world where you don't need that level of robustness, what's the impact on the commercial technology development?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So assuming that the regulatory environment catches up, it should lower the barrier to entry for commercial customers to get into UAS to replace things that they're using, maybe, even like manned systems for right now. Things like agricultural use cases, where you need a low cost way to crop dust, but you need to crop dust once a year. There probably isn't any reason that you would need a really high level system to do that. So, having the defense lead the innovation, and push industry to innovate around that attritable mass will likely make it easier for commercial customers to enter into the UAS market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right, Kara, so let's talk about the Replicator initiative. Can you describe for the audience what we know about it? What information is still missing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Replicator caught most folks, I think it's safe to say everybody, off guard when the Deputy Secretary of Defense Hicks announced it in early August, and she announced it to the press that we were going to do this initiative. And that's where she introduced the name Replicator, that was going to leverage unmanned systems to bring mass and prepare for upcoming conflicts. After that press release, there's been just a lot of confusion in industry around what does this mean exactly? What's going to be their acquisition method for doing this? Is there going to be an RFP? Where is that going to come out of? And what we know today is that a lot of the coordination for industry and government is coming through the Defense Innovation Unit or DIU, and that we have moved to the point where we believe that there's going to be tranches for Replicator. And we know that tranche one is what they're focused on first, but beyond that, we've had nothing really official from the government providing firm guidance to industry on what to expect coming forward. I think the number one thing folks aren't sure about is where the money is coming from. We know that Hicks has said that this isn't a new program. So Replicator is not a new program of record. It's an initiative. Also not clear is whether or not it's accelerating current and funded ongoing efforts by the DoD or if it's starting new. So this is one of those times where there's a lot of information trading happening in industry. There's a lot of engagement with the government and trying to put the puzzle pieces together on what this means so that we can be in a position to meet the demand if and when it comes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, tell our audience if you could just, what drove the need for Replicator and really what is it, why did, secretary Hicks feel it was so important?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Replicator is about bringing this mass into the environment. And I know that sounds really high level, but we're talking about all domain attributable autonomous systems, which has a confusing acronym. If you're familiar with other DoD acronyms like A2AD, this is ADA2, that all domain attributable autonomous systems. They've been fairly forthright saying that the reason for Replicator is to meet the growing threat of China. And that's been the motivation around it. What we've learned since then is that we aren't just talking about unmanned systems that are in the air. We're talking about unmanned surface vessels. We're talking about unmanned underwater vessels. So we're going to be covering down on all of those domains.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned tranches. What do we know about the plan to roll out the tranches, and what's Tranche One?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we know that the tranches were something that the government, they had an internal committee, and they reached out to the services and to the combatant commands and asked for recommendations on what should be included in that first tranche. We know that those recommendations were then given, We believe that they've done a vote on that. Hicks released press towards the end of last week saying that she's made her decisions and she's going to be presenting them to Congress. So, our best guess is that she'll do that in the next week or two, and then after she gets congressional approval on that plan for Tranche 1 that it will be announced and communication with industry will happen then. There hasn't been any commercial solutions openings or RFPs. There have been a few RFIs, which are requests for information and it's not binding that have come out related to Replicator, but we haven't seen anything related to tranche one come out through official government channels. It's actually all been coming through the press.

They're planning on doing what's called reprogramming funds. So that would be potentially tied to the 24 budget. So there's a lot of what I like to call business development math going around trying to figure out Tranch One. So figuring out, hey, is my company on the list? Does it say what thing that we make is on that list? Great. So we know they're going to reprogram funds and we know that the 24 budget will likely hit on x date which means the money would be available on y date so that we can inform our leadership on what our next steps are going to be.

So what's going to be able to be autonomous in that all domain. And when I think all domain, I'm really thinking about back to that Pacific theater. So what's going to work when GPS doesn't, what's going to work when you're in the water, what's going to work when it's been days and you haven't been activated yet. So there haven't been any formal requirements for Replicator released to industry. So a lot of it's going to be around the press that was released and some of the industry events that have happened. The DIU is going to do a Replicator industry summit either this month or next, they haven't announced it yet. At that point, the hope is that some of those requirements will be released to industry. What we've been told is that Tranche 1 is going to be a way for them to experiment and learn on how Replicator should be. Because in the name itself, there should be a process that is able to be replicated. We aren't just producing systems for the sake of it. We've done that before. that's not too innovative. This is more about the DoD itself having a process that it can replicate on how it can step outside of its traditional acquisition boundaries and achieve mass when needed and creating that replicated process they can pass on as needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We talked earlier about the industry's lack of certainty about forecasting demand and therefore investing in manufacturing and technology.

So, I get the argument of not investing without firm orders, but there's a balance to that. At some point you have to be investing so that you stay relevant and so that you stay ahead of this wave that you can respond to in short notice. How do the major players in the industry think about this balance? How do you think about it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that balance is one of those checkpoints that at an established industry, you're checking in constantly on the forecast. You're checking in on how things are looking month to month. Because you want to be able to ramp up manufacturing, but you also have to maintain quality. So you're balancing a lot of factors when you're looking at it. And most of the established defense industrial base, they are manufacturing at a fairly high level already. They are pushing out what's needed. And it is always the question of, well, what if that quadrupled? What would you do then? And the answer is, new manufacturing facilities, hiring additional people, and all of that takes time, especially when you're talking about manufacturing things like munitions. You can't just, throw that together in a couple weeks and get it going. There's a lot of regulations and certifications that need to happen before that can get going. I think that it's possible we may see some government investment in the manufacturing capability for weapon systems from the government, similar to the, CHIPS Act that came out. But if you look at the CHIPS Act, it takes a lot of time for that to flow down to the industry as well. So I think it's one of those we need to just prepare for.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You said the defense industrial complex is supplying at the demanded rate so far, or say that again so I make sure I have that right. And my question that's tied to it is, how do you think about that in the context of the current order backlogs for existing missile systems, which we're reading about in the press right now? But please say that again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I think the defense industrial base in general is producing at the quantity as required by their contracts. So a lot of that demand signal is going to come from their contractual requirements. Things like lead times, they're usually built into the expectations in their contract, and so Peter, you brought up missile system delays, there will be times where they're going to be untenable delays and delivery. And the more complex the system you're delivering, the more likely you're probably going to hit some of those. But for your smaller group one UAS, you're likely not going to hit those kind of delays. And so those are going to be able to be produced relatively easily, as needed, depending on that demand signal and contractual requirements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you think that there's a logical conclusion that comes out of this? That, some of the future systems that get designed, the people designing them will put certain constraints on it that avoid very complex handbuilt components or exotic materials that, by avoiding those, would allow them to ramp production rapidly in the event of a big change in demand due to a conflict. Is that something that's being discussed that's being pursued as a theory now or not?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think I see that trend in industry. I'm seeing the trend to move away from the exquisite. But I'm not seeing that demand signal in government solicitation documents. And that's really where it ultimately needs to come from. Because if the exquisite one off system is what wins, that's what industry will, create. Because there's going to be payoffs for using commercially available parts. And those payoffs will likely come in performance. And so the end user has to accept that, where if you want something, let's say you need a solar powered high altitude drone, if you're willing to accept that solar, high altitude drone has commercial solar panels that were not, designed and engineered for that drone, what you're likely doing is you have less payload. Or you've had to change the design in a way to account for the commercial solar panels. So if the end users and the customers, if they accept those trade offs, you're going to see even more of it in industry because it's what makes sense. And it's what allows us to have shorter lead times. There's nobody in U.S. industry who wants to tell a customer that it's going to take 180 days to send you what you ordered.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>54:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, that ability to rapidly ramp up production might become one of the requirements of the system design.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. But I think even more so than saying rapidly ramp up production, because you're always going to have companies that are going to put their finger in the air and say, well, what about additive manufacturing to create my exquisite part that I developed for this one particular air system? You actually will likely need to see a more explicit emphasis on using commercially sourced parts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara what do you think is the advantage of startups in this environment, especially with respect to those kinds of entities being more long term looking in terms of capital allocation and planning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think startups have a huge role to play in this because startups bring a couple advantages. The first being focus. A good startup is focused on a particular subset of a problem, and large companies, they're never going to be focused on one small piece of anything. They're focused on a whole family of systems, a family of products. So startups can bring that focus, but they're also going to bring investment, which gives them freedom to experiment. And you're going to get a lot of innovation from that, that is going to bring advantage to this challenge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>56:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if you had an audience of innovators, well, actually, you do have an audience of innovators, you said, listen, this is a great environment for startups. And these are the three things I would focus on. What would they be?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>56:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the three things I would focus on if I was in a startup right now would be Underwater Unmanned Vehicles, Surface Unmanned Vehicles, and whatever is the next generation of counter UAS. There's a huge proliferation of companies that do USVs and UUVs. In my viewpoint, and maybe folks can send me emails and tell me I'm wrong later, which I'd love to hear, there isn't a clear leader. There's no Anduril or Palantir of USVs at this point. And there needs to be one. There needs to be that company that's not just pushing the envelope, but leading the pack. And for counter UAS, you have some of the larger defense startups like Epirus that have a really exciting product. But, like all good startups, they've been really focused on one subsection of it, and there's a lot of space left that needs that American startup innovation concentrated focus.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that's a pretty good size industry. If I remember correctly, it's today, maybe a couple billion, but it's supposed to go to 10 plus billion in the next couple of years. So it's a good size, realizable market for a startup to get involved with. And you're saying it's not a crowded space, counter UAS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it is, but I think there's not a lot of sticky in that space. Because if you had to name a company that is in counter UAS, I would challenge you to name one off the top of your head that wasn't Epirus so I think that there's a lot of room left to rise above the level that folks are at now, and proving out maybe a different way of thinking about counter UAS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think there have been a lot of attempts in Counter UAS, but the results have been, middling. It feels like there, there really is a fundamental breakthrough and approach that's required to give Counter UAS the upper hand over UAS, and we're still looking for that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I believe that it'll come out of the startup community when it does arrive.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, where do you think the innovation is needed more in counter UAS, on the detection piece or the mitigation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mitigation and also the delivery of that mitigation. So, another Catch 22 is that the best way to deliver a kind of UAS payload would be by UAS. And so, how are you going to get the mitigation to the time and place of need because you may not have the range to do it from the ground.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interesting. Back to the Replicator, why do you think the announcement was done in a way that it was, with such levels of ambiguity?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I can tell you that, my joke is that it's the whole thing is a psychological operation, either against our own defense industrial base or against the Chinese. We're all going to spend a lot of calories trying to figure out what's going on. But it was probably something as simple as, sometimes in bureaucracies, the only way to get something done is to say it publicly. And so it may be a way of making innovation happen is by forcing it by telling the press we're going to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a very interesting theory. So if it was the former, what is it about the existing military industrial base that needs to be shaken up?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think shaking up on the idea of a low cost system is that an announcement like Replicator makes even the most established large businesses think about, how can I make it cheaper? Let's go back to the CAD designs. Let's really think through what can we drop? What can we modify? How cheap could we make this? Because they want to be ready to talk to the government about how they could meet the mission. And so it is a forcing mechanism where, in general, you are not trying to think about how to rip out everything out of your system to make it as cheap as possible is not a common thought exercise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if that is the end goal, and especially if this is the end goal for the 18 to 24 month timeframe as initially communicated, what's on the critical path to achieving this in terms of technology or processes or anything else for that matter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In all honesty, the biggest piece on the critical path is gonna be clear announcements and communication with industry so that industry can start working to meet the intent of what we're doing with the Tranche One of Replicator. And then also clarity on what the Tranche Two and Tranche Three however high those numbers go. It's what's the vision there? Because sometimes if it's something that's going to maybe push the envelope further than we're doing right now, R&amp; D doesn't happen overnight. And industry has the capacity to invest in it, but you need a heads up, you need to be that trusted mission partner and sit shoulder to shoulder with the government and see what they're trying to achieve, what's the overall concept of operations that we're doing here, and that's going to be the critical path. The more that's shown to industry, the more that we'll be prepared to meet the challenge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so let's say that, the industry day for the Replicator happens this month and there is clarity in the volumes and let's say the DoD decides that we want to be able to manufacture in 24 months from now, tens of thousands of group one and group two UAS systems. Is that realistic? What is the realistic path of achieving that goal look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I don't know if tens of thousands is realistic, but hundreds or even low thousands is absolutely realistic. And once that's clear, the individual industry partners will make a plan and start working to make sure that either investments need to be made, a reprioritization of resources needs to happen. And we'll all start marching towards the goal of being able to do that. I think right now, when we're in that ambiguity and haze of not being entirely sure, I think this is probably the hardest part. This phase, I think, is going to be harder than actually delivering on the goals. Because we aren't able to do anything with the amount of information we have right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So do you see a need for innovation and entirely new technology development that needs to be executed on in order to be able to ramp up to these levels? And I'm thinking novel manufacturing processes, cheaper infrastructure, or perhaps, certain elements of the supply chain of the industrial base that requires new R&amp; D, new technology development, or is it a matter of just having a line of sight to capital and scaling whatever existing technology?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think innovation is absolutely going to be required for the later tranches. What we've heard about Tranche One is that it's going to be about systems that are already in production, or are about to be in production. So the anticipation there isn't that we'll need to change anything about what we're making. It's more about being ready to make more of them. But for the later tranches, innovation is absolutely, I think, going to be required. And even for the current first tranche, there's a lot of room for innovation around how things are manufactured, how supply chains work, and how supply chains are also managed. Because a big part of being able to supply mass is also maintaining mass. And so we'll need to look to innovation to be able to do that better than, is currently done.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's your intuition about tranche 2? What will that look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My intuition is that it will likely focus on what I like to refer to as enablers. So when you, when you start thinking through having, let's say 3000 drones, then you start to wonder, okay, I just delivered these to fill in the blank Army customer. Now, how are they going to actually employ that mass? How are they going to, train for it? How are they going to do the command and control for it when they're actually using it? And a lot of those are going to come from what I call enablers. And so you're going to see things that are less attritable, but maybe still autonomous that work in concert with the mass to enable the mission to actually happen. That's my gut for Tranche 2. It may be a later Tranche than that. And I also think, contested logistics is going to be a focus of one of the Tranches as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, yeah. Before we wrap up with the podcast, I wanted to ask a quick question. I mean, at the end of the day, a lot of innovation comes on the commercial side because of defense spending. Let's say we implement Replicator in the next year or so. What major change on the commercial side will occur because of Replicator?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the major change we're going to see is probably a rethinking of economy of scale pricing from our commercial partners. I think that a lot of economy of scale pricing for commercial components is on the idea that those really large scale orders come in very few and far between, and I'm not sure that their profit margins are going to hold when they start getting multiple orders at the high end of those economy scales. So I think we may see some pricing innovations come out of the commercial sector. And I think we may also see what I have mentally been referring to is like Kirkland brand options for drone components. Just like you can go to Costco and you can get your Kirkland brand for fill in the blank. I think we may start seeing that in the drone industry as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, arguably it'll drive prices down. The US commercial drone companies, will they be negatively affected by this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that until those Kirkland brand options are available, there may be some scarcity in the market, or there may be a difficulty at meeting your price objective given to you by the government. But eventually, where there is demand there's gonna be market\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Arguably at a lower price because of the\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>for the volume\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>driving down costs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in line with that, do you see the evolution of some kind of mil spec drones being designed and then bid out to different manufacturers to produce at scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that's the only way you would be able to achieve the kind of mass we're talking about and then sustain it.

I say slippery slope like it's a bad thing. The idea of having warfare be just about who has the most money on resources and not actually hurting people. It's actually doesn't sound like the worst thing to me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, that's the inevitability of it that I referenced earlier.

We talked about the state of the UAS market with a specific focus on defense and then how drones are being used in the ongoing war in Ukraine. We talked about the Replicator program. What do you see as some of the most common misconceptions when it comes to this industry?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think one of the common misconceptions, and I definitely fall into this trap myself, is forgetting that other countries have good drones too. And that it's not an area where we have pure dominance. Ukraine has definitely shown us that there are systems that are coming out of other countries that are performing really well on the battlefield and are giving Ukraine an edge and they're cheaper and they have a great deal of capability. So I think one of the things that's important to keep in mind is that we aren't the only game out there for this and that's a good thing to keep in mind because it keeps you sharp and it keeps you focused on making our capabilities even better.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Great point.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, I gotta tell you, I am so impressed with how you've handled these questions and you get to the point, you're brief, and you're so knowledgeable.

We also discuss the potential for near term use cases in advanced air mobility such as drone delivery to revolutionize logistics and e-commerce. \u003Cbr/>\u003Cbr/>Lastly, Dennis shares invaluable advice to entrepreneurs on how to navigate the aerospace industry and build a culture of courage and humility.\u003C/p>","itunesImage":"https://storage.buzzsprout.com/variants/9z4d9d9icynjltshyn584rag25ct/60854458c4d1acdf4e1c2f79c4137142d85d78e379bdafbd69bd34c85f5819ad.jpg","episodeNumber":"28","seasonNumber":"1","duration":"2839","weight":"34111274","soundLink":"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1875560/11726878-28-dennis-muilenburg-aam-strategic-perspective.mp3","podcast":"6316261939dfae00184ce4f2","autoSync":false,"categories":["air vehicles","commercial aviation","defense"],"tags":[],"videoUrl":"","audioEmbed":"\u003Ciframe data-src=\"https://www.buzzsprout.com/1875560/11726878-28-dennis-muilenburg-aam-strategic-perspective?iframe=true\" height=\"200\" class=\"episode-iframe lazyload\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"true\" style=\"height:200px;\">\u003C/iframe>","guests":[],"transcript":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","seoImage":"","featured":false,"updatedAt":"2024-01-11T21:30:53.300Z","type":"PODCAST","entityType":"PodcastEpisodeDto","restricted":false},{"_id":"63456a0127bc99c3c8dd4573","id":"63456a0127bc99c3c8dd4573","title":"#25 Richard Aboulafia; Industry Insights","slug":"25-richard-aboulafia-industry-insights","pubDate":"2022-10-10T22:00:00.000Z","link":"","guid":"Buzzsprout-11474597","thumbnail":null,"description":"\u003Cp>There are few who are more listened to in our industry than Richard Aboulafia, Managing Director at AeroDynamic Advisory. \u003Cbr/>\u003Cbr/>We start with a discussion of the macro trends and drivers influencing the commercial and defense aviation markets.
