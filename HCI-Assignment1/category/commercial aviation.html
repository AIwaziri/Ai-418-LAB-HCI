For those of you who've been listening to many of our last several podcasts discussions, especially those with Rob Britton and Jeff Luckett, you'll find our discussion with Kevin a perfect follow on. After discussing areas where some may disagree with Kevin, we launch into an overview of electric aviation. And the industry that blossomed due to its introduction. Kevin also discusses that the electric-only industry hasn't seen the battery progress that many had hoped, which has pushed back the timelines of many fully dedicated electric vehicles. We also discuss how electric only vehicles especially eVTOL have more limited near term use cases. We then talk about hybrid propulsion versus electric propulsion. We discuss what parts of hybrid propulsion are changing the fastest today, and it's different and unique use cases. We then discuss why an operator in regional air mobility would select an electric vehicle versus what some would consider the more obvious choice of hybrid electric propulsion. We delve a bit deeper into regional air mobility and how overall electrification may increase the use of regional air mobility. We discuss the pluses and minuses of pure electrification hybrid and traditional aircraft on regional air mobility as well. Kevin wraps up our discussion with some great advice for our innovators and entrepreneurs. Kevin, thanks for joining us for a terrific discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Kevin Noertker, as you profitably innovate in The Vertical Space. Kevin Noertker is co-founder and CEO of Ampaire. Over the past eight years, Kevin and his team have pioneered practical, compelling electrified flight through the upgrade of existing aircraft types. In 2019, they flew the world's largest hybrid electric aircraft. In 2020 and 2021 they deployed and demonstrated electrified flight with multiple airlines across the globe. With over 23,000 miles flown hybrid and 12 plus regulatory flight approvals across three countries to date, they're a leader in hybrid electric aviation. Prior to Ampaire, Kevin contributed engineering and program management expertise to advanced aircraft and satellite technology development programs at Northrop Grumman and as a research fellow at Caltech and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An entrepreneur at heart, Kevin is driven to apply the science and engineering disciplines of large aerospace organizations to pressing environmental problems here on Earth.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, Kevin, welcome.

The first is, we're in sustainable aviation and there's a lot of talk about new design planes and new markets, eVTOL and, high speed new design jets. And first is, I believe that we need to start with propulsion rather than airframe design. And there's a whole lot of good that you can do with new airframe designs, but novel propulsion is how we've seen these transformative moments progress in the past, whether that's the dawn of powered flight or the jet age. And I think you need to get the propulsion right before you start doing the transformative vehicle designs. There'll be a lot of people out there that might disagree with me on that one. Number two is that,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, I'll just, if I could jump in. I had a very senior transportation leader call me last week and say exactly\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>that's great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After listening to so many of our podcasts, he called me up and said, I want to talk about propulsion. And then I, as we were preparing for this, I was thinking, Oh, wow, this is perfect timing. So at least there's one person out there who agrees\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I appreciate that. Well, he and I should grab coffee sometime. I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp>great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And to add this strikes me as perhaps more commonly held view than perhaps you are alluding to. All the new technology waves in aviation revolve around or are enabled by new propulsion. So what is it about this particular statement that, the industry disagrees with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's the idea that you need to do the new airframe design with the new propulsion in the first embodiment. Ampaire over the years has gotten a lot of pushback from industry stakeholders about doing upgrades of existing aircraft types. But you can't capture the full opportunity, they say, by upgrading an existing plane, you really need distributed electric propulsion, or you need the new airflow augmentation, or your vertical lift features, and that they believe that those features are going to drive the adoption dynamic, and that propulsion retrofits which is the path Ampaire has taken, is not a sufficient starting place. I think that's where the differentiation comes in. Because certainly eVTOL, let's take as an example, requires novel propulsion. what I'm saying is we can decouple those as a first step. Not to belittle the benefits that you would get from a clean sheet design, or maybe it's ultra short takeoff and landing performance. But the fact that designing a plane around propulsion that is not yet certified, that does not yet exist, is a recipe for having to redesign that plane half a dozen times. And we've already seen people burn a lot of capital going through that path this turn of the wheel. But if you just look in history, I mean, this is new design planes that didn't do it around existing propulsion. That's one of the big gotchas in the, in the design space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And there was another thing that you wanted to flag.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This is going one layer down there for propulsion. Hybrid electric is the only approach that makes sense right now. There are many exciting technologies. Obviously, fully electric is a dream many of us have. There's some corner cases where fully electric might work. There are a lot of people pushing hydrogen, but the reality is just like on the ground. Hybrid electric is going to lead, it is the gateway technology to this future. And I think it's going to be the gateway technology for decades.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I didn't expect a different answer from you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'm talking about, anything with commercial relevance, where operating flexibility, that is range, payload, airports that you can fly to and from, anywhere in the economics, anywhere that matters, and you need to get to scale, hybrid electric is what'll get you there.

And everything else you have to place a bet on an unknown that's completely out of your control. Whether it's battery energy density or hydrogen costs or infrastructure. And, and hybrid doesn't place any uncontrollable bets. It's just about good execution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, elaborate on this point a little bit. Why is it that the industry doesn't think that hybrid is the way to go?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think back to when we founded Ampaire. And I think back to a lot of the people in this industry who have such deep passion for making a positive impact on the world around us. And those core motivations for many are about usually one of two things. Either they care deeply about the environment and they want a true zero emissions solution. And that forces their designs into a fully electric or, a strong hybrid where you're flying fully electric for some period of time, or a hydrogen where they can claim a, zero carbon emissions in flight, if it's a fuel cell. And so what you see is this desire to have a pure carbon, remedy. And that causes people to not prefer the hybrid electric type approaches or these hybrid approaches where, you know, 50 percent fuel savings, 50 to 70 percent in our vehicles is phenomenal, but it's not zero. And if you're here on only principle and unwilling to look at anything but the pure solution, then that would bias you against it. The second is, there are some people who are pushing toward this idea of you have to start with the absolute simplest, simplest possible architecture, even if it's not possible today. And electric is phenomenally simple. And the maintenance costs are super low, and in theory you can get the economics to play out, depending on your battery assumptions. And if you believe, if you have certain optimisms in that area, then you don't want to give yourself the complexity or the crutch of having to do the partial via hybrid solution. And I think that keeps some people away from it because they say, oh, batteries will get there. Like, let's just wait around for those. But I think they miss the point that if you can serve, 10 times the market size by using hybrid electric, and you're saving half the fuel burn on that. That's, do the math, it's five times the positive impact of a few or zero emissions on that one tenth of a market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Let's talk about electric aviation. Zoom out a little bit, catch us up on some of the major milestones in electric aviation over the last several years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, electric aviation has had some pretty amazing progress in the last decade or so. The earliest companies in this industry were founded in the, 2010s but very few were talking about them at that point in time. You had the starting of, the NASA X 57 program. By the time Ampaire was founded in 2016, there still really weren't that many companies that were publicly acknowledged doing work in this space. Since then, we've seen this, this, blossoming of ideas, of concepts, I remember, the first time, I think, Peter, you were, you might have even been there at the, Uber Elevate Conference out in Dallas in 2017. There's this industry that built up around the enthusiasm for electrification. And then you saw hundreds, I believe the number peaked at over 700 different projects in this space. A lot of ideas, a lot of people who really get excited about designing airplanes. And, want to go through the features. So, big milestones. You've had first flights, whether those are the flights of the Pipistrel Alpha Electro, or ultimately that being delivered to customers around the world. You have the first flights of various development program aircraft, Ampaire's first flight in 2019, and, subsequent iterations, for example, our, Caravan flight in, 2022. The industry's also made progress from, simple demonstration of flight capability to very specific capabilities. So in eVTOL, the progress of transitioning from vertical lift to fixed wing flight has been a, a big challenge where still only a handful of companies have safely made that transition or done so with a pilot on board. These are critical milestones that will drive confidence in adoption and ability to gain regulatory approvals on the, on the operations. You've seen some incremental progress along the battery energy density. standpoint, so a lot of folks are waiting for batteries to have significantly higher watt hours per kilogram, so the gravimetric energy density in the lithium ion batteries in particular. And we've seen some modest progress on that and some really amazing announcements. Some groups who are in the chemistry side trying to, get up toward, past 500 watt hours per kilogram, targeting 1, 000 watt hours per kilogram, pretty audacious goals. I think, the industry hasn't yet seen, as significant of progress as many had hoped, and that's, that's pushing back timelines for entry into service of the fully electric, fully electric vehicles. And then from a certification standpoint, some pretty big milestones. Back to 2018, where we were kicking off a ASTM committee around electric vehicle chargers, through all the SAE committees or other industry groups working together on certification. While these might not be the visible milestones that hit the press, there's certainly the milestones and progress that help move the industry forward. And so, watching folks get their first certification bases established, or get a, get means of compliance agreed upon, or special conditions, moving forward, ultimately looking, I think here in the next few years, we'll get the first full, regulatory approvals for commercial operation. And, and each of those are some of the very meaningful milestones that are, happening real time and coming up soon.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the surprises for me was, the lack of certification events following Pipistrel's EASA certification of their, Velis Electro aircraft in the LSA category that was back in the summer of 2020. And then earlier this year, I think in March, the FAA issued an LSA airworthiness exemption for that same aircraft. But here we are four years later and no other electric aircraft has been certified. Why do you think that's the case? What's the bottleneck? about the.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think the, there are a few things. One is, the regulatory basis for certification. And the Pipistrel products didn't fully open up the Part 23 or the vertical lift, certification arena. it was in a different category initially. And I think that while it made progress and maybe others could have taken their products through that same, the, you know, the identical regulatory pathway, many of the products that are out there that we most were paying attention to are in Part 23 or the vertical lift category, which was not as fully opened up through the Pipistrel application. Think second was a bit of the dynamics in the market, so with the pandemic in 2020, I think a lot of milestones were dragged out a bit. 2021, money was easy, and I think that meant that money went to moonshots. So easy money doesn't mean it goes to practical, near term, near term wins. And so I think that a lot of the money that was being invested in late 2020 and throughout 2021 was going toward long horizon plays. So purposefully not aiming at super near term strategies. And I think that overfunded those, and we've seen many get significant funding, but then burning through it, and I think it underfunded the pragmatic strategies. and so what you saw was further pressures on or delays to the timelines for entry into service for those that might not have been as flashy, but were, were just making the, the next increment of meaningful progress. And then we've seen the retrenchment of the markets where now there's a bit of a recoil. I think, the industry's at risk of losing credibility. Given all the claims that were made and failed to be lived up to, whether that's certain timelines, or product performance, or cost metrics for the products. And so, I think the industry, in particular the capital allocators, may be licking their wounds from those moonshot projects that didn't play out, which doesn't help again those that are near term. What it does is it pulls back more capital away from everything, and so if you're looking at that as a lowering tide, each of these dynamics I think is has pressed away from certification milestones that we might have otherwise hoped to see more rapidly after the Pipistrel's early successes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what about the maturity of the enabling technologies themselves and the certifiability of the motors and batteries. What's the status there? And I was recently catching up with another founder and we started talking about this and it was surprising to hear how the regulatory bodies are trying to apply traditional propulsion system requirements to electric motors. So for instance, I think there's a requirement somewhere in internal combustion engines that they need to be able to run for, I think it's five minutes in max rated power, whereas an electric motor reaches its thermal limit, a lot quicker, maybe within, two minutes or so before needing to throttle back. And so that is one contentious issue, allegedly as is the example of having dual magnetos in ICE engines, and does that translate into, you know, double architecture in electric motors, all of that increasing mass, increasing budget, and really not making that cost equation as favorable as initially expected. Do you have any insights into those aspects of how the bottlenecks are being tackled at the certifiability and the maturity of the technologies?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think that this gets to one of the really critical and core risks in the industry, which is the supply chain and the ability to not just invent something, but to produce it reliably many times at a good economics. That's really what builds the markets here. I think the regulatory bodies are trying to adapt to what they know. And, those adaptations, whether it's the Part 23 rewrite, which adapted combustion type expectations to, an opener, larger net for what kind of technologies could actually be used to meet those requirements. But in the details, they're still looking for that familiarity. So what's your mean time between failure? How long can you run at full power? What are the failure modes and effects, and making sure that you're going through the detail on that? This is the, the specifics that you get into when putting together your program certification plan, your means of compliance, or ultimately going through the testing for your, Type Certificate or STC, and it is, it's really where the rubber hits the road in the industry. I don't think that all the answers are there yet. I think there are the early entrance, certainly Ampaire is, at least to our knowledge, the only company working on a hybrid electric propulsion system certification program actively with the FAA. And so this means that we are, we're clearing many of those open questions actively with them and collaboratively with them. It also means that we have, expectations upon our supply chain that, emerge over time if something, for example, with the FAA, brings up or highlights a requirement that we did not expect. As you talked about with the motors. for these questions about redundancy, there's what you could expect as a technologist, like you'd understand the technology and you believe this to be true, some level of safety, let's say, but that does not mean that will be accepted on the first pass through certification. And in fact, I think that the first paths through certification are going to be relatively risk averse and risk managed in those setting a higher bar for redundancy, not giving you credit for levels of safety that you think you might deserve. So, case in point, for the lithium ion batteries, no matter what you do to the cells, no matter how you package those cells into your modules, no matter what physical, interconnect or disconnect controls you have that might mitigate thermal runaway, or physical barriers that might mitigate propagation or software layers that are on top of all of that. The belts and suspenders and layers of safety. At the end of the day, the FAA, probably rightly so at this stage, requires you to show that you have physical barriers that if you force the battery into thermal runaway, the vehicle will be safe. So you don't get, you don't get actual credit for everything below that. You need ultimate safety and then all the other stuff that you thought was going to be sufficient. And these are, again, I don't think it should be surprising to anybody that the earliest, earliest applications, we're going to take a, the most risk managed approach. But what it means is that when you're a battery engineer on your fully electric vehicle, you're now doubling the weight of all these additional systems when you thought you could get there just with a really good BMS algorithm. And so what it drives is the decisions and it drives the, ultimately the designs into corners that might not be viable given some of those early assumptions. This is why we pushed again toward hybrid electric, because with a battery pack, a third the size of a Tesla pack and able to take on the extra weight and the payload hit along with it for all these physical layers of safety, we still have phenomenal performance on our system. and I think that these are, these are areas where the industry is trying to navigate alongside the regulations to mature, the solutions and the risk, together.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, what electric aircraft are selling in meaningful numbers today that you're impressed by?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you say stelling, I'm gonna assume you mean where there's a cash transaction and somebody ends up with an airplane. in their hangar at the end of it, and right now the only airplanes that are selling, are the Pipistrel aircraft at this time. There are many organizations placing orders, pre orders for, eventual deliveries, but at this stage, very minimal on the actual sales in this market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Kevin, what are you seeing as the FAA's thought process for how industry is going to incorporate improvements in hybrid electric propulsion systems into these aircraft in the coming years. These aircraft are long lived assets. Batteries still seem to be improving pretty markedly over the years. Motor technology as well. So if you certify something, on the one hand, you're locked in at that point in time, are they going to use an STC method for bringing improvements in? Or is there something that is even more fluid for allowing that, that they have in mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's a really good point because the technology base is moving so much faster than the time scale of a vehicle life, right? These aircraft last 40 years. And the, batteries are improving on the, on the order of every two to three years, you'd expect people wanting an upgrade of their battery pack to the next generation, a little bit like people might want their new iPhone every few years. The way you go about certifying your product matters. And if you wrap everything into the type certificate, then you need to amend or update the type certificate when anything changes. And so that would require a supplemental type certificate for certain types of changes. Generally, propulsion systems, propellers, or airframe changes require a new type certificate, or a amendment, or a STC, supplemental type certificate. There are things you can change on an airplane without having to go get an STC. You could replace a conforming part with an equivalent part. You're able to show certain equivalent levels of safety. And so there are efforts to try to find ways that these components which would be replaced over time, let's use the batteries as an example. Batteries degrade over the cycles of use, and every few years you want to replace those. You have to go get an STC for the new battery pack are you able to use a TSO type of process? Basically a lighter version of those approvals. And it really depends on exactly how that battery pack was incorporated into the vehicle level certification. So is it part of the engine? Is it part of the aircraft? Is it a safety of flight critical component? And then as technology improves, One of the things in aviation is you lock yourself into the parts that you designed and that an in any change in that part requires a change in your regulatory approval. So as batteries improve, how do you go through that certification pathway? Again, generally, what I think the industry will see is we guarantee equivalent performance while providing improved performance. And that all you're doing when you're meeting the existing regulatory waterline is you're saying we're at least as good as we were previously, and we haven't changed any flight characteristics. The question will be, when do you want to take credit for that? When do you want to allow the operator to plan a longer route? You can give them more energy, which gives them more safety, or maybe it gives them more flexibility on how many, how many flight miles they can perform or when they need to recharge at the other end. But it might not be part of the underlying. certification, performance capability of the vehicle that you've, that you've sought from the regulatory body. Now, this is a nuance, but it's the difference between having to go through the full cert program for the new tech or just increasing performance but taking credit for an equivalent level of safety. One specific point here, in our hybrid system, I have triplicate redundancy in our hybrids. We are phenomenally safe, and I believe safer than a traditional combustion engine would be, where it's a single point failure for the traditional engine. And in our, in Ampaire's system, we have redundancy, two layers of redundancy in the combustion engine. And then also this independent electric system, which is able to carry you further as well. But am I going to get credit for anything more than a single engine capability? Probably not. and that's understandable, at least initially. And I think over time, what people, what you'll get is additional credit for those things from the regulatory body. And in the interim, when new tech, motors, or batteries come out, It'll be at equivalent levels of safety as what was there previously.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What components of the hybrid electric propulsion system are changing the fastest right now, be it the battery systems, the motors themselves, power electronics, or something else? What do you see as the fastest changing or evolving?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, the fastest changing components historically have been those which had the benefit of riding the coattails of other industries. Aviation, as big as we love it and believe it is, is much smaller than, as a market driver, than other forms of ground transportation. And so we have been the recipients of rapid technology improvement across lithium ion batteries as energy density, volume density and cost get brought down. The, the motors have been a, truly the underlying enabling factor in many of these cases. So the power density of motors is pretty phenomenal compared to where it was a decade ago. And we still see companies that are, and we work closely with companies that are pioneering in this space. And you can start, you're getting great efficiencies and really high, power density out of these motors. Where, certainly Ampaire has locked most of the components for our launch product, but we have a flying testbed where we're able to bring in new technologies, where we first flew a silicon carbide inverter, when we have brought in new motors, inverters, and energy storage tech. And it's really in those, the motors and batteries that most people are pushing firmly for innovation, and then a bit in the efficiency of the power electronics, but a lot of that currently is, seems like it's lab scale technology. And while our work with ARPA E and NASA enables us to make that move even faster, I hesitate to, to think that lab technology today is going to rapidly enter commercialization anytime soon. I think we've seen a consistent trend that timelines for those developments take much longer than, than the, the technology teams would, would have originally anticipated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is aviation going to continue to benefit from advances in the automotive industry around the batteries that they use? Or is there going to be a fork in the road where the needs of aviation diverge from what the auto industry is pushing towards?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, the auto industry used to have range anxiety. But then battery energy density got to the point that you can drive hundreds of miles. There's a sufficient charging network. So I don't see the energy density being what automotive is optimizing for anymore. Really, I think automotive is going to continue optimizing for cost, and we've seen that over the last few years. Bringing the cost of an EV down is the driver for adoption more than bringing the range up. Whereas in aviation, we're still in that bringing the range up is the requirement. And so this is a divergence in the optimization goals for the technology coming out of automotive. Now the question would be, even if the goals are different, is the state of the art, the state of knowledge and capability, is that going to improve? As folks go toward lower cost, are we going to also see emergent benefits for aviation? Absolutely. As people do innovation and build new types of electric machines, it's no longer just about what is Tesla using in a Roadster, it's about where the larger vehicles, your mid duty and heavy duty trucks, what are the power requirements for those vehicles. What are the energy densities required for those? And so it's this expanding fringe of requirements that I think will also drive a, an alignment in, in, in emerging technologies with what aviation is looking for. But the core of a ground car is, is less likely to directly align with aviation than it did over the last decade in my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Are the batteries that you would design around for your hybrid electric conventional takeoff and landing airplane, are they the same ones that you would design around for a VTOL aircraft? And the reason I ask is that, an additional difference that I've, come to appreciate with batteries for VTOL aircraft is the power output demand on them, especially requiring high power output at the end of the flight as the aircraft transitions back into vertical flight to make its approach at the landing pad. That's a particularly, stringent requirement on the battery system. For what you're doing, I don't know, maybe that still exists. Maybe it's the same battery. Maybe you, you can, use the same tech, but how do you think about that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a nuance that most of the world, unlike you, Peter, most of the world doesn't catch the nuance between the different types of batteries. The power density versus the energy density needs to be tailored for the application. And what's interesting is you gave two examples. I'll add one more in there around fully electric airplanes. So let's take your eVTOL, which is fully electric, but requires huge amounts of power at a low state of charge at the end of flight, right? So you need a power cell there. Then you have a fully electric airplane, which has a large amount of batteries. And so actually a relatively low C rate, especially if it's conventional takeoff and landing. You're not really draining where, for those listening, the C rate is the rate of charge or discharge. as a proportion of the total pack size. And so that, when you have a really large pack, relative to your pack size, you're not discharging that rapidly. And so those can be energy cells, because you don't really need that high power C rate. But then you go to a hybrid electric plane. And as I mentioned, our pack is about a third the size of a Tesla pack. These are pretty small, actually. When you come through our hangar, you see this battery is big enough to fly a Caravan, really. And that is because in a hybrid, you use the battery differently than you would in the fully electric. A small battery pack, but you still have pretty high power for takeoff and climb. Again, now you need a higher C rate. You need more of a power cell. And so for each application, you do actually have different requirements for the type of the type of chemistry you might consider, the, tailoring of that cell between energy and power, certainly the life cycle economics of the pack, the degradation over time, you might have great power or great energy, but if you only cycle 400 times, then are you useful? There's a, there's, there are all these pieces that go into the details of selecting a battery. And this is the challenge that some companies who are trying to do a one size fits all, cell or module for everybody, need to hit the high waterline or miss the, miss the mark on their, their certain markets. And this is again, why I think it's so important to have a more flexible design where let's say that I need to increase the size of my pack a little bit because I'm not getting exactly what I wanted out of my supply chain, where we can handle that. it's not ideal. We don't desire it, but when you have a, an approach, which is just a little bit more flexible than, the pure heart requirement, I think most eVTOL folks. A lot of the ones who have decided to in house their battery development is because they realize they will not get precisely what they need from anyone else, and they have to tailor it directly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Given the advantages of the hybrid propulsion to electric, why would the eVTOL or the electric plane companies go purely electric versus hybrid? What would be some of their rationale?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Number one is, that I hear from them is on the emissions. They want to be able to say they can operate fully zero emissions. Number two is a statement around, around complexity, the economics of maintenance and that's a, it's an interesting argument which, without being deep into the weeds, it's hard to validate or, dispute. All the weeds that I've been in have shown that fully electric still has a way to go before it's economically more viable. But those are usually why I see, that it can, there are other ancillary features, like, for example, noise characteristics are important for communities. Oftentimes the reason communities get upset with aviation is because of the noise. And hybrid electric does not fully eliminate the noise profile, to the extent that full, that fully electric does. Fully electric planes, if you've ever flown in one, it's like being in a glider a lot of the time. It's really beautiful. and I think that some people have hung their hats on the sound, and frankly, to their credit, if you're an eVTOL talking about flying to the city center of Manhattan, you better be thinking about sound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's not how people are going to scale in the next several years. At the end of the day, regional air mobility most likely is how a vehicle is going to scale in the next, let's face it, 5 to 10 years. And given regional air mobility, given the requirements of the vehicles, I'm guessing that hybrid is going to be the, the limitations of hybrid are not nearly as impactful as they would be if they go into city center. And how many city center flights are going to be occurring in the next five to ten years, and especially at scale. So my guess is a lot of people right now listening are saying, hybrid's the way to go. Why would they not be saying that, especially as we start to talk about regional air mobility?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so it depends on who they are. Let's say that you are an eVTOL developer. We know many. And you've spent the last half a decade, investing how many hundreds of millions of dollars into your pure electric design. That is tailored, that every inch of it is optimized specifically for your fully electric operation. You don't have volume, you don't have weight, you would have to redesign your plane in order to integrate a hybrid electric system. And I know this because I've worked with those groups, and we have shown that you can apply a hybrid electric system in. But shoehorning a hybrid into a combustion plane is one thing, that's where we enter the market. Shoehorning a hybrid into something which was designed for a little battery pack, is a completely different beast. And I think a lot of these developers have gotten so deep into their fully electric application that they don't have the payload and volume capacity to take on the hybrid electric into their current designs. And so,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But let's move on. Let's say, Kevin, sorry, great answer, but let's talk about the operators who are going to be purchasing these vehicles. Why would they consider a fully, let's again, let's step into regional air mobility. Why would they consider a fully electric plane with its, with some of its limitations? Obviously some pluses, but the hybrid I would assume is still less noisy, for example, than a traditional combustion engine. Why would they consider a fully electric plane rather than a hybrid for regional air mobility in the next 5 to 10 years? What's their rationale? Put yourself in the position of an operator who has to make that decision.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so I would ask, what's the risk? Am I, what, truly, what's the risk? The risk that I put down an order? Even if it's binding, I'm sure there are tons of outs that if it, if this doesn't meet my performance requirements, I don't have to buy it. And probably if I'm putting money down, it's going into an escrow that it can come back to me. Most aren't putting money down for the fully electric, type orders that are out there. And so I would look at it and say, I could place an order for a fully electric plane and if it doesn't pan out, great. If all of the Swiss cheese of good things going right doesn't occur, I probably got a boost to my marketing and brand along the way, and I'm not out any money at the end of the day, I could probably still buy a hybrid down the road. Now, the reality is a lot of these groups are falling behind in our order books, so, potentially they won't be as, as, as early as they would like, but if magic happens and the performance is what people would love electric to be, then I get the electric plane and everything that I needed. And so I think it's a risk posture that, the benefit of placing a signaling order outweighs the risk. And the key for me, as Kevin and with my Ampaire hat on, is those folks still place orders for hybrids. Right? Like, when I talk to folks, they're like, Kevin, this is the first thing that I actually have confidence is going to come to market. I'm going to place an order for this. And what's silly is some of those people still say, and by the way, we don't want to talk publicly about this because our brand is still like fully zero emissions, but we know that this is probably going to come in first. And so we'd like to take part in it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, in what way is certifying a hybrid configuration easier or more difficult compared to certifying a battery electric?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the hybrid, one of the reasons it's easier is the safety case. The safety case for our system in the, condition where you assume you have an issue with the electric vehicle system, which is really what is the novel, parts of the technology. If you're in a hybrid electric condition like ours, you fall back onto a combustion engine and you fly home safely. We have full cruise capacity. With our combustion engine, so there's no degradation or risk to that operation if you shut off the electric system in flight. You can't say that for a fully electric, or hydrogen, for example, system that, when you have an issue, maybe you have redundancy in the battery packs, but the level of safety that you can, that you can, take credit for in the hybrid is quite a bit higher. And, and certifying that is, is we believe going to be faster and lower complexity and lower cost than going fully electric. The second is around the size and, requirements on each of the subcomponents. So whether it's the batteries or the motors, when you look at the reduced consequence of an issue, you can also, take different or take a different balance on the, the probability of certain issues occurring. And, and so the holistic risk analysis for the, the safety case, we have a little bit more flexibility. And that means that flexibility translates into the supply chain and our ability to move a bit more quickly and getting those, getting those technologies through the certification program.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the expected efficiency gain of a hybrid electric conventional aircraft versus the efficiency gain that we are seeing from hybrid electric automobiles? And is there a difference? And if so, why? And then we can get into efficiency gain that you would see from just like retrofitting an existing airplane versus designing an airplane around hybrid electric. Especially for the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft because going to electric propulsion when you want to do distributed electric propulsion for vertical flight or for electric STOL, okay, we get that, right? There's a capability there that's earning its way onto the aircraft. But if you are going for conventional takeoff and landing, and you are looking for an efficiency gain, what can we expect to see?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the efficiency of these hybrid systems, and I, I see hybrid as this gateway technology that as the underlying technology improves directionally toward fully electric, all of it will first get proven out in these hybrid electric systems, conditions. One of the, one of the great drivers for adoption of hybrid electric is the fuel efficiency of the systems that, that we and have already demonstrated and have been flying tens of thousands of miles so far in our hybrid systems and demonstrated a 50% fuel burn reduction. During takeoff and climb cycle, we're up closer to 70 percent fuel burn reduction. So these are actual measurements, right? This is not just an Excel spreadsheet model. This is empirical data and is the kind of benefit that you can get in certain embodiments of hybrid electric systems. So this is, pretty, pretty significant fuel savings, even when you're looking at the, the opportunity of hybrid-electric on the ground, where, call it maybe a 40 percent fuel savings, to 50 percent fuel savings on the ground. And it's all about the specific architecture of the system that drives the beneficial economics. Fuel is one of the largest, if not the largest, operating cost for most airlines. And so the fuel burn reduction then drives a positive cycle for the economic viability of new routes and market growth and higher frequencies of service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What phase of flight are these efficiencies realized the most?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, if you're just looking at a pure percentage basis of fuel savings, takeoff and climb is where you're getting the biggest boost from the electric system in our current architecture. There are lots of different hybrid architectures, and we've got a few of them, but what we're launching into product, into market with is a integrated parallel hybrid architecture where we use the electric system effectively as a boost during the high power phases of flight and the combustion engine as a baseline load of power for the cruise and, and across the rest of the flight. So you get up to 70 percent fuel savings, during that takeoff and climb cycle. And then it levels off toward about 50 percent fuel savings during the cruise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I see. What's the state of the art in some of the metrics on the battery side? We talked a little bit about, well, we didn't talk numbers, but gravimetric specific energy density, both at the cell and the pack level, the cycle life that state of the art batteries are achieving, and the, battery pack cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the, the batteries, so watt hours per kilogram is the metric that we in the industry normally uses to measure the energy density. The target most are aiming for is right around 400 watt hours per kilogram at a pack level. We're not close to that today. When you're looking at the packs today, you're at, right around 200 watt hours per kilogram really depends on your cooling system and where you draw the dotted line on the battery pack itself and what you include as weight versus don't include as kind of wet versus dry weight for the pack. The cells themselves, are, I remember a few years ago seeing cells that were cresting through the 200s of watt hours per kilogram, and then you get folks who are talking about 300, even into the 400 watt hour per kilogram cells. I think I've seen announcements about cells that are even significantly higher than that. Unfortunately, I'm not an expert in the kind of the lab type chemistry that goes into these batteries and the art of understanding where along the long tail of getting from lab into production you are and in measuring the number of years remaining is very challenging. And so it's hard to tell what, like, state of the art for, for the development of new technologies sounds like it's pretty far ahead in these high watt hours per kilogram. I think the reality is the first battery packs that get adopted into market are going to be at a pack level, maybe even sub 200 watt hours per kilogram, when you're looking full scope, full scope weight of the system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And in terms of cycle life and cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Cycle life and cost are, generally tailored depending on what your application are. So if you've got a more exotic cell, a higher power or energy density, it'll probably have a lower cycle life. I've heard some of our industry peers talking about cycle lives less than a thousand cycles. I don't see how that makes a whole lot of economic sense when you have to be replacing the batteries so, so repeatedly. We think that a 2, 000 to 3, 000 cycles, maybe it's 2, 000 full depth discharge, but you're looking at, you know, that might give you 4, 000 or 5, 000 actual flight cycles on a, on a vehicle, that's not unrealistic when you're not working with the most exotic type cells. And from a cost, I think, we're pretty conservative assuming costs are going to be pretty, pretty high, and it's hard to tell what'll come out in full production once you actually get to scale, but being at$500 per kilowatt hour, I think would be a great outcome for the industry if we were able to get there. And, I wouldn't be surprised if the very first battery packs that came to market were quite a, maybe a multiple higher than that. So maybe a thousand dollars per kilowatt hour. Which gets pretty expensive, especially when you're looking at the very large packs for, for the fully electric vehicles, but is still somewhat manageable with the, with the hybrid electric approach.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to put some business perspective into the conversation and if we use, uh, maybe we can get to ultimately the use case that you are pursuing at Ampaire, but one of the common near term use cases for electric aircraft is often thought of on the conventional side as a flight school trainer aircraft. Now, putting aside that the current range restrictions do not enable flight schools to use electric aircraft for the entirety of the curriculum for flight training, but for most, missions, it's good enough. What I'm interested in is when you actually go down into the weeds that you've been in, how the business case for an electric, fully battery powered aircraft pencils out when you consider the fact that, conventional piston engines are an industry that's been around for decades, benefiting from huge economies of scale, exceptional safety records, it's in the several thousands annual units, a lot of the development and R&amp; D costs have been recovered already. I mean, you're going after a relatively low cost. And I think the engine, replacement on, in this type application is in the 30, 40, 50. maybe 70, 000 per engine, correct me guys, uh, if I'm off. Uh, but at any rate, uh, you have that on the one hand, and then you have an electric, aircraft with a motor that, needs to recover the certification costs and development costs, and is one that every, you know, thousand cycles needs to replace the battery, which can be, I don't know, 80, 000 or whatever the cost is. So when you bake all of these different things, does it really become an attractive option?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So this gets back to your first question around what might the industry disagree with me on, and it is this principle that the economics must make sense in order for people to adopt the products. There are a lot of people out there who assume government subsidies will get us there, or people willing to pay a green premium. And while certain cases that might be true, to hit the scale of adoption that's required, you can't achieve it without really compelling economic benefits for the end user and buyer. So this example that you gave around the, the training, especially in these smaller airplanes, is a great one. The market makes so much sense. The direct operating cost seems so low when you're only taking into account the industrial power that you're using. It's cents on the dollar for OpEx. But when you look whole scale and you're comparing yourself against a, sub 100, 000 airplane with relatively low cost of capital, it's probably fully depreciated, and you're comparing that to a quarter million dollar new build plane that has these unknowns around the cost of batteries over time, or the cost of the infrastructure to charge. The economics are really called into question, especially before you get to full scale. And I think that's, rightly should be acknowledged as one of the big risks for adoption. The performance of the systems, especially in training, I think a blended fleet where, cross country flights might have to be in a hybrid or combustion, but fully electric can be done for the, a few touch and goes here or there, or just familiarization. That's, I think that's completely reasonable to solve the problem. But the economics, especially in smaller airplanes, are pretty challenging. When you look at the economics as you scale to larger planes, it similarly, anywhere that it's not an operator of, high frequency becomes challenging because to earn back the capital cost of the system, you really need high utilization. And, you're not generally going against an option which is a premium priced combustion versus a premium priced electric. It's probably a relatively low cost combustion versus a premium priced electric, and I think that will be a friction point for adoption for those types of applications.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, if you were to argue for a fully battery electric aircraft, what is the right initial use case that will generate this flywheel moment where it makes sense and it also is a good path to get to scale, which will have benefits down the road with economies of scale and the supply chain, et cetera, et cetera. What use case gets the industry going, if not flight training.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think the use case that gets the electrification industry going is using those technologies in full scale applications. So it's taking the exact same batteries, the motors, the power electronics, These certification bases, taking those and by applying them into the hybrid electric applications, you build the industry base. You build the production volumes. You solve those economic challenges tied in with the supply chain and the certification and the market's readiness to adopt. Tying in with the economics of the full scope view, you start to bring those costs down to a point where all of a sudden those same technologies, those same suppliers that are making batteries for the hybrid or making motors for the hybrid, when the economics of scale get to a point, those same suppliers will be the supply base for the fully electric applications where, the opportunities are vast for, where you might want to fly a fully electric plane, whether it's short hop island hopping for commercial cargo flights, commercial drones, or for eVTOL cargo, or for pilot training. There are a lot of areas where you might want the fully electric. And I think the way to get the industry to scale is by scaling the underlying components rather than scaling the end solution of fully electric. And that's when I talk about hybrid as this gateway technology, I truly believe I'm helping all the electric, maybe even helping some hydrogen out there. Like because we're maturing the industry, we're maturing the supply base and we're getting up to good economics, full scale marketability of these underlying technologies that ultimately can be packaged in the fully electric. And that's I think that's how you get there. In eight and a half years of every waking and sleeping moment thinking about it, this is the pathway that makes sense to me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We just had Rob Britton on a couple weeks ago, our last podcast, and he was talking about regional air mobility, and he was saying that it's conceivable that hybrid or electric aircraft will allow us to be able to get to locations that today are less profitable than using a purely combustion engine aircraft. Talk a little bit about that. I'm guessing that hybrid would be the only solution today, although he did mention, I believe, guys, a 30 passenger electric plane as a potential solution in the near future. But talk about the capabilities for hybrid electric for regional air mobility. What's the near term, long term solution from your perspective, Kevin?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I really enjoyed listening to the episode with Rob and his enthusiasm for regional hybrid electric. You can hear it coming through in the conversation. Love it. And the folks over at Heart who you mentioned a few times, you know doing some really interesting work in trying to open up the regional space. Also in that episode, he had mentioned that this regional space is kind of eroded over the years. I mean, with deregulation and things having to compete just on the economics, economics really didn't make sense to serve a lot of secondary or tertiary markets. And so the service to those markets has gone away. And, that demand still exists, it's just being served by ground transportation, people jumping in their cars instead of flying. If you were able to give an economic alternative, lower cost of operation, being the key adoption driver, then people would potentially choose to fly those routes instead of drive those routes. And I think he was spot on with that and the enthusiasm around regional air mobility. Two areas that I would disagree with the approach, though. One is there's a phenomenal difference between a 19 passenger plane and a 20 passenger plane. While it might look almost the same, it is categorically different, in the literal sense of it, is a different category of airplane between Part 23 and Part 33. And the idea that somebody will open up regional air mobility with a Part 25 plane that is something over 20 passengers, I think, is faulty logic there. I don't think it's going to be, Part 25 is not going to be ready for hybrid electric, fully electric, any novel system for quite some time. Now, I want it to be there, and we're certainly helping the industry get there, and there are companies betting their, livelihood on it, but this is where I would disagree with the approach because we believe Part 23 is where it has to start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, explain for the audience the nuances of the differences.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So there are two major categories for conventional airplanes. One category, which is under Part 23 of the regulations, governs all planes up to 19 passengers or the equivalent weight. Part 25 governs all airplanes, 20 passengers and above. And so when regulations are updated in the industry, they're updated for one category or the other, eventually both. The smaller aircraft category, Part 23, is already positioned with all of the legislation and regulation in place to adopt novel propulsion technologies. The larger category is not in that state yet. It takes a decade of work to make a significant change to regulation in aviation. And I think we have years ahead of us before the large aircraft is ready to adopt novel propulsion technology from a regulatory standpoint. The technology might be there, but I think the regulations are going to lag in that case. So entering market with Part 23, or airplanes that are up to 19 passengers, I think is the fastest way, and frankly the only way we will see commercial adoption this decade. And that maybe in the next decade we'll see, through the proof points of these Part 23 smaller airplanes, we will see that technology leapfrog up into and enable the conversion of those certifications requirements in the larger Part 25 airplanes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Speaking of regional air mobility, wanted to get your thoughts on whether you think that electric aviation is what catalyzes regional air travel, or is there a, simply a thickness of the demand that's an issue that needs to be addressed somehow first. You know, we can take a brief look at history prior to the 1978 deregulation, point to point was the, airline network model, and regional travel was subsidized by the government mostly. Post deregulation, we saw the emergence of hub and spoke and a lot of regional routes were abandoned because they did not make economic sense anymore. So you can look at that to draw the conclusion that, well, actually the demand is there is just a matter of making that air travel economic. And so, that's an argument for the technology's role in disrupting, again, this, segment of the industry. If that's the case, well, first of all, do you think that's the case? And then second of all, do you think that electric aviation is the technology that will make economics appealing or you need to start layering additional things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I absolutely think, electrification is the pathway to making the economics make sense. And the improved economics drives this elasticity, this growth in the market. where we will see increased frequencies on the existing routes, decreased ticket costs as competition goes up on those, and increased accessibility or flights to fringe airports, either in a hub and spoke extension or a point to point model that, that allows more people to have access to air travel. I think adoption will also be driven by in similar economic driver but through cargo. I think the cargo market will be a rapid adopter of good economics and will be serving maybe even before the passengers choose to fly to these areas. Same day and next day delivery of packages is a growing expectation for our global economy and I think that what we'll see is as the economics improve the cargo operators, so, think your, your FedEx's, UPS's, DHL's, and similar around the world are going to be adopting these both to serve the high end communities who, want their Amazon packages in the next day, but also to open up these billion people markets that don't currently have access to the global economy efficiently, whether that's moving agricultural goods or other products, the economic drivers of increasing accessibility for them. So it's not just about U. S. states and cities. I do actually think on the global scale, these economics open up countries, entire regions of the world that are currently isolated from the global aviation ecosystem and economy. And when you look at that as a driver for scale, it's not about you know, 10 percent increase in the people who want to fly to Fresno. It's about a going from a market of zero to a market of again, hundreds of millions of people being served for the first time ever and what that drives. And so I wholeheartedly think that the economics of electrification is what gets us there. It is also on those principles that I think some of the exciting features aren't necessary to get us there. So vertical takeoff and landing, important in some areas, but probably not important for the vast majority. Fully electric and important and beneficial, but not useful if you can't land on that dirt strip in Kenya. Like, you have to have full flexibility, and this is part of the reason why I have such conviction around the regional air mobility being opened up through hybridization, where we don't have any of those infrastructure, range or operational limitations, but give that great economic benefit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Kevin, let's say we had a Part 23 aircraft and we wanted to be able to get more aircraft to cities that are not being well served today. And you're saying Part 23 was the way we'd have to do it today. What's the cost per available seat mile for a conventional aircraft, hybrid and electric? Assuming the three of them, could meet that capability today, what's the relative cost difference between the three?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the difference in CASM between conventional and hybrid, we're looking at really depends on, on exactly how you're operating the plane, right? So it's going to be a range. We're looking at a 20 to 40% savings on your cost per available seat mile. So think, again, depends on how you're flying the plane, going from a dollar per available seat mile down to, 70 cents or there's 60 some odd cents per available seat mile. that kind of a transition in certain cases. Electric's harder because right now when I run the numbers, depends on how you assume battery costs, because batteries are the big replacement cost there, but the, right now it does not in my mind, close economically to go fully electric. Also, it's hard to do the analysis because most of the routes you can't even operate. And then the question comes in on, do I count the grid infrastructure upgrade costs and capex and costs of that capital over time in the analysis, or do I not? So it gets a bit muddy. I don't have numbers specifically on the electric in isolation, for those reasons.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you talked to airlines, who today say those routes are not profitable because of the traditional aircraft? Have you talked to them about your operating costs? Are they saying, if you can get me a 30 to 35 percent reduction, that's a route that becomes profitable?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Yeah, the numbers I just talked about are from a very specific model with a very specific airline that I can't mention the names of, but yes, we get into the weeds with our customers and look at their actual operations, their actual frequencies, and how they actually fly the planes. And look at holistic costs, because it's not just about how many miles or hours you fly, it's about pilot costs, it's about outstation staffing, it's about infrastructure upgrades, and if you're serious about this, you need to look holistically at every, down to what is the interest rate on the loan that you take out in order to, or the financing that you get in order to buy the system in the first place. Like there are, all the holistic view on the economics, and making sure that is, economically positive for our customers is how we get through it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I really want to underline the holistic approach because I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. There's a lot of enthusiasm about quoting direct operating cost reductions with electrification, but if you look at it in the context of regional air mobility, where you're really competing with cars and rail and when you are accepting the fact that electric motors are not in their prime time to address this need today, and you start talking about, okay, well, what really do customers care about other than price? They care about frequency and the reliability of the schedule. And that means that you have to be able to, honor a, a service that will be available in all kinds of weather or most weather. So now you start talking about IFR capability and now you start introducing IFR reserves on top of an already small range budget. And it's only when you look at things holistically like that, do you really get a clear perspective on, okay, how really competitive is electric aviation in this particular use case today or over the next couple of years. And I think that, you know, there needs to be a little bit more realism.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I agree, because I think that realism is going to be what builds credibility. It's what enables adoption, it's what enables all of these other factors, many of which we haven't even touched on, whether it's the insurance companies or the lessors, we have to worry about residual values. the holistic view is the only way you actually get a full ecosystem to buy in. And, I just recently had a deep dive with one of our major customers, on IFR, speed, and Flight into Known Icing conditions, because these are the realities of their operation. And we need to know, hey, if we choose to fly five knots faster or five knots slower, what are the repercussions? If we are, like, flying, like, guaranteeing IFR, or if we are, if, what happens if you're not flight into known icing conditions? You're hardly useful, because it's not just Alaska where you have to deal with icing, right? It's everywhere that you have to be confident in your aircraft's ability to operate. Otherwise these mission critical operations have to ground the plane. And if you ground a plane in one of these operations, it destroys a whole network. It has a residual ripple effect through the operations, until recovered. So, so it's important to have these capabilities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So here's a thought, Kevin. What if after all is said and done, the, 30, 40, 50 percent improvement really becomes something more like 10 percent? I'm talking hypothetically here, right? At what point does it make more sense to incrementally improve the efficiency of a turboprop or a conventional aircraft that is certified, well known, all of those things, and perhaps kickstart the electrification supply chain on the unmanned side of things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It makes a lot of sense to, to find wherever you can build the efficiencies into the operation. from the airframe design, there's some folks out there who, with traditional engines, are looking at cutting 30 to 50 percent of the fuel burn out of your 7 37 class planes by bringing, blended wing body type airplanes to market. So there, there are ways that you can, by creating a new aircraft, even if you're not changing propulsion, you can get some meaningful efficiency gains as well. At the end of the day, when you achieve fewer economic benefits, it reduces the addressable market for the technology. So, or inverting that, for every percent cost that I save, it opens up more and more market opportunities. So, there's a old story in the industry about a major airline that removed a few pages from their in flight brochure to save a few pounds because that mattered, right? And these are fractions of a percent saving. So in your example of saving 10%, still transformative. For many operations. Now, is it going to be as transformative as saving 40? Nowhere close. Will it still be meaningful? Only if it's economically compelling. And so this is where you look at the conversion. You know, so maybe somebody struggles to retrofit their plane, but if you're buying a brand new plane and you get to choose between, CapEx neutral across the two, the combustion or a hybrid, and that hybrid saves 10 percent on your OpEx, you might still go with the hybrid system because economically that still makes sense. So this could be a factor that delays adoption if the economics don't work out. From an unmanned standpoint, we're already seeing from a drones, eVTOL, or like a Department of Defense type applications some fully electric, uh, or places where the economics don't matter as much, where you know, they're willing to pay a premium for the mission capability. Those are certainly additional early adopter areas where I think, the industry is likely to get a boost, regardless of the fuel savings, a boost in market applicability because of the performance characteristics of these new vehicle types.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is the drone propulsion supply chain overlapping into the propulsion supply chain that you deal with?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, a year and a half ago, we acquired a company's assets, called, the company was named Talyn and Talyn was developing a, effectively a cargo lift drone, and various types of payloads that it could carry. Our propulsion systems fit straight into that cargo drone, straight into traditional, conventional takeoff and landing drones, or eVTOL, for a whole variety of applications. Ampaire's focus is, again, the disagreement place number one. Propulsion is where you begin, and I want to put propulsion across everything. And, yeah, so the same engine types, I mean, there are flavors and variations of engines, but, the major families are applicable across. across the industry, whether it's manned or unmanned.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, tell us a little bit about Ampaire. How do you make money today? How do you make money in five years and 10 years? What's your special sweet spot?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Ampaire is focused on the electrification of aviation, focused on propulsion, specifically hybrid electric propulsion, upgrading existing aircraft types as an entry point into market and using that as a gateway to transition the industry toward lower carbon and better economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Give examples of the type of aircraft that you're converting. I saw a Skymaster as\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>so back in 2019, we flew our very first aircraft type, which is a upgraded Cessna Skymaster push pull configuration. We call that an independent parallel hybrid architecture, where you have one combustion engine, one fully electric. We've also flown the Cessna Grand Caravan, which is with an integrated parallel hybrid architecture that uses a, mechanically coupled electric and combustion set of engines to be a hybrid electric aircraft. That same engine that goes into the Caravan is what we just finished our CDR on the King Air for integrating there. We've got the Twin Otter is a 19 passenger plane in the same category. And there are thousands of planes in market that use this category of engine. So this is our half megawatt class system. We also have a quarter megawatt class system, which is used as a, either a genset or propulsion system for general aviation, drones, and eVTOLs. Now, as a company where we're focused is around the certification of that launch product and the Caravan. The market that adopts that is both passenger carrying and cargo carrying for the commercial industry, but then also we've got a number of contracts with the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Energy. So our money today, our revenue, which is really just offsetting NRE costs, or non recurring engineering costs. We've brought in about 25 million of government contracts. For these, through these government customers, for the development of our propulsion system and the application of that system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're making$500 million in 5 years, who are your primary customers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we scale commercial revenue, this comes from the regional aviation market. These are folks who are currently buying turboprop engines and would instead of overhauling their engine or buying a new engine, would be buying one of Ampaire's hybrid electric amp drives. These amp drives are the ones which save 50 percent fuel burn, and we believe will save on maintenance cost as well. So it'll be good economics for people to switch over to our systems rather than run on their traditional combustion system, and this is where we see the earliest adoption for technology. So begins as retrofits of the existing fleet of turboprops, but then quickly moves into partnering with OEMs, the aircraft manufacturers, for when they build a new airplane, giving it a hybrid option. The next phase is, of course, working on clean sheet design planes with OEMs who are optimizing planes, new designs, around the novel propulsion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Tell us a little bit about your, you have a great history of being an innovator and entrepreneur. Give us some lessons learned to our innovators who are listening today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, it's been eight and a half years at Ampaire. The number one and biggest recommendation I can give is choose something that you deeply love and that you think you can actually achieve. The days get challenging over the course of years as an entrepreneur. It is not easy. It is oftentimes not even fun. But when you know that you're doing the right thing, when you're tackling the most meaningful, challenging, visible problems that you possibly can, it gives the motivation, not just for you as an individual innovator, but truly, these are things done by teams. And when you have meaningful work, and you're thoughtful about it, it enables you to pull together teams of really great people to go do these audacious things. I think the importance of setting tangible and tractable goals that you can actually achieve in the near term is very important. It's not just about moonshots, it's about the steps on how to get there. And, and ultimately, it's about building long standing relationships and not looking for what do I get now or, being short sighted in them, because truly the world is built by people and, and supported by relationships that are built over years or decades. And so, being a good actor in the industry is so important.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, you've acquired companies, you were almost acquired yourself. What advice would you have for people who might be going through a similar process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so always be open to opportunity and thoughtfully assess it. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the opportunity to go public via SPAC was pretty exciting, and there was a whole lot of money on the table, both from company valuations and from operating budgets. But you also have to be willing to change course when it's clear that the course you're on is not the right one, which we did in early 2022. Ampaire pulled out of a deal to go public because we realized that it was, the higher risk path and it was not worth, continuing down that path of going public and getting acquired. These are hard decisions that you need clarity, you need good advisors and mentors to support you on, and ultimately you need to set the ego aside a lot of times and go on good first principles when making your decisions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, thanks a lot.

Rob has five decades of experience in commercial aviation, and I guarantee regardless of who you are or who you work with, you'll love this discussion. So how to describe this talk? It's a blend of the history and promise of aviation and commercial aviation, the role of hubs and why they started and continue, a reality check on aviation and sustainability, the challenge and opportunities for advanced air mobility with the necessary dash of prudence, and a thorough discussion of regional air mobility. It sounds like a lot, but there's a constant theme, the value and promise of aviation, the power of market forces, the need for innovation and not just in technology with prudent optimism laced through the entire conversation. I had lunch with a few friends last week who loved the podcast. Thanks to you both. And they encourage us to keep the introduction short so our guests can get to the meat of the podcast. So for at least this podcast, we listened. So many thanks to Rob for this uplifting and serious conversation and to our many and growing number of guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Rob Britton as you innovate profitably in The Vertical Space.

Great having you with us.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Happy to be here. Thank you for inviting me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>First question. Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I think that I, because I've been around for so many years, most of my perspectives are fairly well aligned with the industry. I think the one place that sort of jumps to mind, and I'm not sure that it's a disagreement necessarily. I think the industry, is, with respect to, sustainability, climate change, emissions, all that stuff. I think the industry, fails to, in their zeal to talk about how, what they're doing with SAF and what they're doing with, fuel cells and all this other stuff. I think that they really fail to tell what I think of as the balanced story and the way that I would explain what I think of as a balanced story, I is this way when I'm in the business school classroom and I, that's where I spend a lot of my life and I give a lecture, particularly when I'm in Europe, and inevitably in Europe, somebody's going to ask me about climate change and airlines, and they may even be quite pointed about it. and I always like to say it this way. I start out and I say, look, commercial aviation is responsible for two to three percent of climate change and gas emissions. It's not 20 percent. It's not 10 percent. It's two to three. Now that's a small percent, but it's a big number, and nobody's in denial. But what, I like to say is I like to think of it in cost benefit terms. Okay, if we own up To 2 3 percent responsibility for climate change gas. What do we get? And the answer is we get an enormous amount of good. Both in terms of all the great things that commercial aviation enables, whether it's adding value to other economic sectors, allowing businesses to grow, providing a foundation for tourism. All of these, all these things. And I think if you frame it in those terms, it's a good way to frame it and I think that the industry seldom kind of puts it in that direction, I think largely because they're trying to put a happy face on it. And I would rather put an honest face on it to say, okay, yes, we own that, we're trying to make it better, but at the same time, we're adding enormous amounts of good and people want to fly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, what is it about the narrative that you're hearing from airlines that is particularly maybe frustrating is a heavy word, I agree with your point we've poked around this topic in our previous episodes, talking about, whether the allocation of capital towards that goal is really going at the right places and will have the desired outcome when you consider the 2 to 3 percent overall, but also when you double click on it and see, what segments of the market are responsible for most of the emissions. And then you end up with a, 15 percent of a 2. 5% Type of problem on and on. So, so that's one side of the conversation, but the airlines are entities that have been around for a long time. They're smart people. They know the business yet sometimes feel the narrative is out of touch with reality. How do you explain\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, it's a great point and a great question, Luka, and I think you're right. It does seem to be a little bit, out of touch. and I think what my basic complaint about the way they frame it up is that, it's all this sort of, fluffy good news, and nobody's really willing to, put some caveats around it. I'm a, I'm a believer in honesty and I think somebody should You know, I think the airline industry needs to say, yeah, we're, we believe in SAF, but let's be honest. It's not scalable at this point. Right. And even if it were scalable, it's going to be expensive. And so, I think a more forthright discussion, at least in some circles, I mean, they don't have to do it, Scott Kirby doesn't have to talk about that when he's making a presentation to the Sierra Club, right? But at some point, there's got to be, I think, a greater amount of honesty, in the debate. whether we're talking about alternative, whatever it is we're talking about, alternative fuels or, whatever else is going on. And, I mean, at the end of the day I think where I, when I really get pushed into the corner, as I would be, for example, if I'm in front of a bunch of students in Sweden, right, home of Greta Thunberg, if I'm really pushed against it, You know, I start to rail about this idea that it's okay for them to fly, right, if they live in Stockholm, and in December and January it's cold and dark and wet. It's okay for them to go to the Dominican Republic to go on the beach, but somehow it's not okay for, a family in India that has just become middle class to take a journey. And so, I'm wavering a little bit, but I get really cranky about this because I think at the end of the day there's a lot of hypocrisy that surrounds all of what we're talking about here. So all I'm saying is let's get rid of the hypocrisy. Let's get rid of the fluff and let's have honest discussion about what we need to do. Now, having said all that, I mean, the arc of things, as an optimist, and I've been an optimist all my life, the arc of things is moving in the right direction. I mean, people are doing the right things. And Luka, you rightly point out, when it comes to capital allocation, that sort of thing. I mean, it's not a perfect world, but we're sort of, maybe it's not correct to say we're moving in the right direction, but we seem to be lurching in the right direction.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Another thing that we brought up in the past in the podcast is that it feels like the airlines are under pressure to innovate where in fact they are the users and the operators of the technology. Do you see that as well from your perspective, right? People are pointing fingers at airlines and say, well, what about this new, more efficient, aircraft or propulsion system Where in fact, they should be turning to the Prats and the, Rolls of the world. Right. And the same, well, what do you have that I can use so that, we can address some of\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I agree with that completely. Yeah, I mean, I think, I agree with you. I think that's a, I think that's a solid point, Luka, but I, in, in the end, it's one of those things where if an airline were to do that, they would end up just getting dragged through the mud. I, so I think that, it's the sort of sense that, we're all in it together, I think is where we need to be. And that, again, that's, one of the points that I always make. to my students, and that is that everyone in the commercial aviation ecosystem understands what needs to be done. No one is in denial. there's nobody that says, this is not an issue. This is not a problem. And so, we all collectively own the problem, but you're exactly right. The people who are distinctly in a position to fix the problem are the people that manufacture engines, and to a lesser extent, are the people that make airframes. and, I mean, and I want to be sympathetic to them because I think, they're working on all these things. But in the background of all this is what I keep saying, and that is people want to fly. And, if you look at, sometimes I see these sorts of, these sorts of interesting collision courses, if we take, the global scale, I look at, the, I look at the, the order announcements At Farnborough last month, for example, and Indigo, in India, I don't know, it's, I lose track of how many hundreds of airplanes they have on order, but that's the reality, right? India is emerging. People are become more and more Indian people are becoming middle class. Their business sector is sort of growing in spite of itself. and people want to fly. And so what we're going to say to them, no, you can't. yeah. I said, anyway, beaten that horse to death, but it is, it's something that I feel really passionate about in that. And so, come back to answering your first question. I think that's what I would say. I think I have a slightly different, maybe not slightly, maybe a fairly significantly different take on the discussion around sustainability and, and climate change.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. and Rob, I would say that this is also, we talked about, oh, it's a propulsion problem. It's an airframe problem. That's where the work needs to be done. I would say it may well boil down to being a petrochemical problem because the most effective path to actually achieving this goal, if that's what people want to do, is to be able to preserve all the existing training, all the existing airframes and create a fuel in a new way that works directly in those systems starting tomorrow. And in that case, then, it's a petrochemical problem and it's, it's those people that we need at the table doing this. And then, oh, by the way, if we solve that, if we find a way to create a sustainable, renewable liquid hydrocarbon fuel, especially if we do it without bio based feedstocks. We're doing it from electricity and water and a carbon source. Well, and that's way bigger than just SAF. That is a new energy storage medium and an extremely powerful one, and one that's so differentiated from batteries that we have anchored ourselves to with the entire renewable energy matrix. That would be literally a massive step forward for civilization if we could do that cost effectively and\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It would. And I've, and again, in keeping with my, my, my realism, but sunny optimism, I think that, we are, everything that I read, and I'm not a, I'm not a physicist, but everything that I read is that, the research is very close on, for example, to being able to sustain a controllable fusion reaction and be able to then take that and scale it up. And if that's, I don't know, I'd love to see it in my lifetime. I'm 72. if it happens in my lifetime, I'll be dancing in the streets. but, if we have a time frame that says it's 20 years off or 30 years off, I think absolutely those kinds of breakthroughs are doable in that sense, whether it's a fusion reactor that generates enormous, virtually unlimited amounts of hydrogen, or it's a breakthrough with other kinds of energy sources that will not, add enormous amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere. Let's bring it on. and, there's, it's clear to me that lots and lots of people, way smarter than us are working on this. And the more that we do, the better and the closer we'll be. So I think, we'll get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Your answer to the opening question is, let's have some realism with some sunny optimism, and let's understand the value that aviation is providing. Let's start the answer to sustainability of, let's first of all remember that these are the things we do for society. That you all take advantage of and they play a very important role while understanding that sustainability is something we, we're only two to 3%, but we're focused on it, but it's not something that's gonna happen tomorrow, but you want a balanced, realistic approach while answering the question. That's frankly a little refreshing. So is there anything else you want to talk about on this topic before we move to the next\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I, I think now, I think the only last thing that I would say is the other thing that makes me absolutely crazy, is when we're singled out, right? When we're thought to be, the only evil polluters that exist in the world. I teach a lot in, I teach a lot in Switzerland, and as they have an enormous dairy industry, right? And as you also know, the world's cattle, have about a 5x impact it's somewhere around 10 percent of climate changing gas, largely from methane that the cows burp. But nobody's going after, the dairy farmer, right? I mean, they are to a, to be fair, there, there are some, green extremists in the Netherlands, which also, they also have a large, dairy industry that are going at this. But I don't want to be singled out. I don't want to be held to be the only evil people around. And particularly in, in the US marketplace where, people still seem to be more than happy to buy enormous pickup trucks, right? And just so you know, we've got a Ford Escape Hybrid that gets 46 miles to the gallon. I ride that bicycle to the grocery store. So, we can't be singled out, and we've got to get back to what you so eloquently say, Jim, and that is this idea of all of this good, and I think to maybe wind this up, that's the part of the story that we're not telling.

But Rob, give us a perspective, in order to predict what we should be doing in the future we want to understand the past a little bit more. Give us a history of the airline industry, just from a historical overview and lessons that you think may apply\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's great, and I'm looking forward to this little history lesson, if you will. So, I mean, and the thing that's interesting about the airline business, and in fact I was teaching this morning, at Georgetown, where I work part time, and I had to explain that it was a group of MBA students, and I had to explain to them that the airline industry, for the first 50 or 60 years of its existence here in the United States and other parts, will look very different from what it looks like today. So here in America, as you guys know, at the dawn of commercial aviation, in order to stimulate the growth of this new technology, the federal government handed out contracts to carry mail by air and then that slowly worked towards carrying people. And somewhere in the late 1920s was the first effort to create a, essentially, a regulated utility model for the airline industry. They were not going to allow the market to do that to make decisions. So what emerged from the Civil Aeronautics Act in whatever it was 1927 or 28 modified through the 1930s was a regulatory regime that was not just operational regulation but economic regulation. And so for 50 years until 1978, a group of lawyers in Washington made all of the commercial decisions for the airline industry. Most fundamentally, could you start an airline? And the answer was almost always no. So they regulated the most fundamental aspect of the business, and that was market entry. Once you were lucky enough to be licensed to be an airline then the federal government, through these lawyers in the Civil Aeronautics Board, which was the name of the entity, told you where you could fly. And so they doled out, essentially, you could think of them as route licenses, right? And those licenses were doled out to two different types of airlines. There were the so called trunk airlines the remaining survivors are American, Delta, and United, but back in the old days there were brands like Eastern, and National, and Continental, and Northwest, and a whole bunch of them. There were the trunk airlines that carried people longer distances, so from Chicago to San Francisco, or from New York to Boston, just from New York to Miami. And then there was a whole network. Fascinating, vast network of what were called local service airlines. And these were brands like I grew up with in Minnesota, North Central Airlines, or it could be West Coast out on the Pacific Northwest, or it could be Allegheny. Or it could be Piedmont, or it could be Ozark, these kind of funky regional names. And these were companies with smaller aircraft serving smaller markets, generally with a nice subsidy from the federal government. So this Civil Aeronautics Board controlled licensing. Once you were licensed, they controlled routes. Sometimes in the case of local routes, and we're probably going to talk about regional mobility sometime in the podcast. So there was a handsome subsidy that, for example, North Central Airlines collected from the federal government to operate a route from Minneapolis St. Paul to Brainerd, Minnesota, to Bemidji, Minnesota, to International Falls. Small communities, 8, 000 people, 9, 000 people. And this network of these local service airlines really, you can, there's a fascinating map that I actually have on my computer, which I could, if you remind me, I'll share with you. That showed you this vast network. So they doled out market entry, they doled out the routes, they doled out the frequency, so they control supply. If you were given what was called, it wasn't really a license, it was called a route award. If you won the route award for new service from say Minneapolis, St. Paul to Denver, which North Central Airlines got that route award in around 1969, the government told you how many flights, not the marketplace says, there's demand for six flights and we're going to meet the marketplace demand. But the government said, we think it's three. And that's what North Central got. They got three flights a day from Minneapolis, St. Paul to Denver. And they were, of course, happy to have the route, because the, the previous incumbent Western Airlines, now part of Delta, had no competition. So they were, they nibbled a little bit toward the end in the period, sort of roughly 1965 to 1978, with a little bit of gentle competition. But the last thing that they controlled, the fourth thing that they controlled, was price. And they set price in a very interesting and comfortable way if you were a producer. They basically set price at whatever the average cost of production would be, plus a guaranteed profit. So for years, the mantra at the Civil Aeronautics Board was I believe that they were going to set fair levels at a point that would produce a 12 percent return on assets, right? it was just bizarre. And so what, so if, and the, and All of that fair setting was done against average cost of production. So if you figured out, if you were a bright guy and you figured out how could I produce this product, Below the average cost of production, you made your investors very happy. And in fact, interestingly enough, cause I come from Minneapolis, St. Paul, that's exactly the model that Northwest Airlines for years pursued. Now they were very clever about that because the long time CEO, this is maybe more detailed than your listeners want, you can just edit it out, but the long time, here's the fun thing, the long time CEO of Northwest Airlines was a guy named Donald W. Nyrup. I actually knew his son quite well. Don Nyrup's previous job, before he became head of Northwest Airlines, was he was a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board. So he, this is classic revolving door, right? He knew exactly how all this worked. And he said, if if I can produce the product cheaper than anybody else, my investors are going to be really happy. And that was exactly the model that they pursued for a long time. So even, with that idea of average cost of production and a nice, built in cushion, companies still found themselves in financial trouble. They couldn't manage the business. And so, for example, in the, I believe, late 1960s, the CAB, went out and engineered, by leaning on Delta, engineered Delta's acquisition of an airline called Northeast. Northeast was on the verge of running out of cash and they said they need help. And, Delta takes over. And there were a couple of other episodes that were like that, in that. So, so this whole thing is micromanaged by a bunch of lawyers on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D. C. And there was this enormous, I mean it was a big, they took up the whole building. And there was, they had economists and they had all kinds of other people, and obviously an army of lawyers and they, this, all of this, all this whole thing set up to make the decisions that would normally be made in the marketplace.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And who were some of the more successful airlines\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I've already mentioned, I've already mentioned Northwest. Northwest was a good one, a Continental. did very well through most of their, through most of their years. Delta was always very astutely managed. and had, they really had a, very, the government basically gave them a very nice route network. So those are sort of three that, three that, that come to mind. So what happens over 50 or 60 years of intrusive government economic regulation? Well, Costs just keep going up and up because there's no competition. There's no Southwest or JetBlue or Spirit placing downward pressure. And all of the older companies, more or less have the same cost structure.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, it's remarkable that this economic regulation of air travel got put in place so early in the infancy of the industry. And my question is, what was the motivation for that? Who was advocating for this economic regulation? Was this coming from the airlines themselves? Was this to protect their profits? Or was this coming from the government? Or was this just an outgrowth of how society thought about regulation at that point in the 20th century?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The principal issue at hand was in the 1920s and even into the 30s, the planes were falling out of the sky and it was not the safe industry that we, the astonishingly safe industry that we have today. And so the impetus for regulation originally was all driven around safety. And the logic that was able to be sold to politicians in Washington, to the media, to the person in the street, the man or woman in the street, was if we allow the market to decide, if we allow competition in this industry, some company is going to get into financial trouble and they're going to cut corners on maintenance. They're going to cut corners on pilot training and the plane is going to crash and everyone's going to die. That was the kind of logic of the 1920s. Then what happens in October 1929, the stock market crashes and there's this massive meltdown and there's this massive, through the early 1930s, loss of confidence in the genius of the market economy, right, and the, suddenly the market economy is no longer able, the skepticism, both, driven from FDR or whoever else it is, even from, for that matter, moderate Republicans are saying, they can't, we, the marketplace is a good place to be, but it's not perfect. And so certain industries are going to need to be controlled. And so that actually added a layer of legitimacy to this whole regulatory, impetus and it just carried on. And so what's happening? So costs are going up, prices are going up, costs are going up, prices are going up. And essentially the, the reality was, as I said, all of the older airlines, whether they were in the, local service category, Piedmont and Ozark and North Central. Or they were in the trunk category, National and TWA and Western, whoever they were. All of them more or less have, in a range, the same cost structure. Their costs are all going up sort of in lockstep. And so when their costs go up, for example, when the pilots union, and as you know, unions have been a reality in, in, in the transport sector in general, and in, in aviation in particular for decades, the pilots union at United, let's say as an example, in the, 1950s, say, we need a new contract we want to raise. United's management just gave it to them because they knew that they knew two things. First of all they had to do was go to Washington and say our costs just went up. You need to raise fare levels. That was reason one. Reason two was they knew about pattern bargaining. The same reality that exists in automobile manufacturers. When the UAW gets a contract at GM, they take it to Ford. Ford. They take it to Stellantis, and off they go. So the United Pilots knew that the Airline Pilots Association, once they got a deal at United, they were going to shop it to every other airline management group, and all, it goes up and up and up. Then what happens? Boom! Mid 1970s, a nice boom, actually. Mid 1970s, a group of influential economists, led by Professor Alfred Kahn from Cornell University, travel down to Washington, and they say, they meet with the Civil Aeronautics Board, don't get much response. They go up to Capitol Hill, and they say, this is nuts. The technology has been perfected, flying has become safe, planes are basically not crashing anymore, and this mode of transportation, which has essentially been perfected, is available only to the rich. Guys, I've been in this business for 55 years. I started in 1969. as a travel agent to pay for college. My parents were broke and I had to pay for it myself. I was a traveler. When I went out to Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport, the only people I saw at the airport were the well to do. So Alfred Kahn says to the Congress, to whoever will listen, if you deregulate the airline industry and you allow competition to come in, prices will come down and more people will be able to travel. So the impetus was entirely pro consumer. And that's exactly what happened. That's exactly what happened. And so the Airline Deregulation Act is passed on October 24th, 1978, all of this intrusive government regulation starts getting phased out. There's open entry into the industry, provided that of course, you satisfy the basic operational requirements. You get a license to operate. And new airlines are starting up. Routes are opened up. Prices are opened up. Prices and fares immediately come down.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, do you think that early period of economic regulation of air travel was unnecessary? Was it a mistake? Could they have started with regulating safety but not routes and ticket prices?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes, I fervent looking back basically on what I know. They could have created a operational regulatory regime that said, here's what you need to do and then put some teeth into it. That if you fail to do this If you fail to do this and you have an accident that turns out to be traceable back to your negligence, you lose your license. Easy as that, right? So, we can't, you wish that you would have had that kind of mentality. And by the way, guys, as this was not just in the United States. This was global. In fact, it was even, in a very real sense, it was even more intrusive than most of the rest of the world, because the model of the rest of the world was state ownership of the carriers. Now, there is a bad idea, right? Let's put government in charge of Air France or The predecessor of British Airways or just about any airline in the world. But, so it's a great, I mean, I love the musing about, what would have happened and how we would have had far less pain than we have today. Because what has essentially happened since 1978 has been an enormous amount of pain, variably defined, visited upon the older airlines. Because they have, in order to survive have had to figure out a way to lever their costs down in order to get, into a situation that sort of approaches equilibrium with the new players that are coming into the industry. And as you guys know, that lever has mainly been Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which is a very blunt instrument, painful for the workers, painful for retirees, but it has allowed the older airlines, the three remaining older airlines to survive and, to get on with their business. But the fruits of this were evident from the beginning. I mean, you could go back, to the early, late 1970s, early 1980s, and you could see, and I was around back then, and you could, I, you'd see a full page advertisement, in the New York Times for People Express, one of very bold start up carrier saying, we're going to fly you for 59 peak and 39 off peak and people are going, wow, this is really great. And so it has been a remarkable achievement. A democratizing a mode of transport that was only available to the wealthy. And I'll tell you guys to put a sort of a fine personal point on it. I think that reality for me spending my career in the airline industry, that's been to me the most satisfying aspect working for 50 years in and near airlines is that we have made it possible for everyone to fly. We're cheaper than the Greyhound, we're cheaper than Amtrak, and now people can fly. And isn't that a great thing?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to ask you a question about deregulation, but before, I'd like to rewind a little bit and ask whether there were any milestones in the pre deregulation days that you think is worthwhile to call out, whether this is the emergence of the jet age or the point at which air travel became a mass market, perhaps when the contours of today's hub and spoke model\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>35:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, well, there's no question that the advent of a jet powered aircraft, with turbine engines that are far more reliable than, than piston engines, was an enormous breakthrough. And so that dating to, 1958 and being perfected then on and through the early to mid to late sixties with not just, new bigger airplanes like DC 8s and 707s flying, but, the emergence of, smaller jet aircraft that could serve smaller communities. That was, that was a huge breakthrough, from a technological standpoint. and there were probably, there were, not probably, there were certainly, smaller, more subtle, things that changed along the way. I mean, I, one of the, one of the things that we sort of, we take for granted today, is, is the emergence of much better weather forecasting, and just, think about that weather forecasting that was really the methodologies and to a certain extent, the technologies that, that were developed during World War II, particularly in, in the European theater of operations, to allow, good weather forecast to enable the B 25s and B 29s to, to bomb strategic targets in, in Germany. So all of that stuff, right, that found its way into the civilian sector. In fact, one of the great early adopters of that technology, that wartime technology was actually, my hometown airline, Northwest. They had a meteorology department, in the late 1940s, that was the envy of the airline industry. They were like, we're on top of this and, we're going to figure this out. So there were those\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And that was the envy of the industry until they merged with Delta. They always had a premier weather forecasting capability. With meteorologists,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Brilliant. Yeah. And, so there were those kinds of things. Now, over on the economic side, I mean, I think it's worth calling out so that I don't sound like I'm, dumping, just enormous amounts of, of bad stuff on the Civil Aeronautics Board. There were people that were around back then that saw what was going on. People like Will Rist, for example, America's former Government Affairs Senior VP. There, there were people at the CAB. as early as the 1960s, mid 1960s, late 1960s, through the early and mid 1970s, they could kind of see that this was a little bit silly. And they could kind of see that maybe we should allow, maybe we should tinker around a little bit with some experimentation. But It was really just nibbling around. So, you had the emergence, I mean, this is going to sound incredibly quaint to us in, in, in 2024, but, we, you had the emergence of family fares, right? Where, husband and wife, and of course it was a traditional nuclear family, husband and wife, and the kids could go along and the wife got, a one third discount and the kids flew for half fare and, off they went to Disneyland or, go see the Empire State Building. Again, to make this personal and a little bit fun, I first got smitten with the airline industry when I was a teenager, and around the same time that I was smitten by the industry, the Civil Aeronautics Board allowed airlines to offer what were called Youth Standby Fares. So, I could join, and I did, United Airlines, they called it the 12 to 21 club. You were minimum age 12, maximum age 21. If you were in that age window, you could fly for half fare, standby. You couldn't make a booking, but you could fly standby. Oh, and I flew to a lot of places, for half fare. Flying standby, and we know we got stuck once in a while trying to get home or whatever, but for the most part it worked out. So there was a little bit of nibbling along the way, but, nothing, like the, the, what needed to really be.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At what point do you consider the airline industry became a mass industry and when did the hub and spoke\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, well, it's so, it was so, I mean, I'm being, I'm being a little bit, a little hyperbolic when I say that, in the, 1960s and 70s, the only people that could afford to fly with the wealthy. I mean, middle class people were flying and, travel was increasing, travel as a, as a component of discretionary spending was some, was there, in the, in the, in, in the post war boom, as the economy expanded rapidly, what, what did middle class people do? They, they bought a bigger house, they bought the wife a car, and then, once that was all sort of fixed up, they started to travel, so people were traveling and, and it was becoming, it was on its way, to, to becoming, a mass business. Now, around that time, a number of very forward thinking, not a large number, a small number actually of forward thinking companies started saying maybe within this constraint of the federal government of the Civil Aeronautics Board handing out routes, maybe we could organize a route network in a way that enabled the evolution of the hub. Right. And of course, the pioneer in this was Delta Airlines. I mean, you go down to Atlanta, Hartsfield Jackson Airport today, and you see this massive hub, the biggest one, essentially the biggest one in the world. But that hub, it really existed even in the 1960s, right? And as early as the 1960s, people in the South said, when you die You might go to heaven, or you might go to hell, but you're probably going to get through Atlanta. So they had that idea down, and that's what they had. Now, interestingly, and to be fair, United did a little bit of that hubbing at Chicago and Northwest did a little bit of that hubbing at Minneapolis St. Paul, and Continental did a little bit. Nobody had anything quite as well developed as Delta. Now, fast forward to, October 1978 and the deregulation of routes and the idea that now an airline could configure their routes in a way that made business sense. And the hub and spoke model then emerged very quickly as the way to move people around a geographically vast country. People say to me, why do we have these things? And people oftentimes ask that question living in a place like Chicago or Washington or New York where they can fly non stop to anywhere in the world. But if you live in Medford, Oregon, or Tuscaloosa, Alabama, or Traverse City, Michigan, you don't have a non stop to even to Boston or to San Francisco. And so, the hub and spoke concept became, an enormously sensible way to move people across a geographically vast nation like the lower 48 of the United States. And from across, a place where population was pretty broadly distributed. It was, of course, an urban population, but not everyone lived in big metropolitan centers. You might live in Birmingham, Alabama, or in Portland, Oregon. And if you lived in Birmingham or Portland and you were on your way to Sarasota, Florida, there was probably not an airline that could operate that route, even without the constraints to operate that route, go in and make money. I always like to explain it. I was going to actually bring them up today. I was, because I oftentimes bring props to class and I talk about how hub and spoke airline model is really like two funnels where the narrow end of the funnel faces each other and the hub is in the middle of the funnel. So they're collecting traffic from all over, flights coming in. Say Delta, flights are coming in from the west. And they're landing at Atlanta and they're going off to the east or coming in from the south and going to the north. And these hubs are, for the most part, directional. because that's, logically the way that you would organize. So these things end up working really well,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is it a fair observation that once the government control was removed over routes and fares, with the deregulation act in 1978, the major carriers focused on the most profitable routes, which ended up being these trunk routes. And with easier access to the market, you had this emergence of regional airlines that started with code chairing with major airlines and started connecting smaller communities to these larger hubs. And so, is that a point where we really start to see, the concept of a regional airline emerge, and can you talk about how that segment evolved and how they then later ran into\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's Absolutely right. and so to use an example close to home, before deregulation, so in the old regulated environment, an airline called North Central Airlines based in Minneapolis, St. Paul, operated a route, with subsidy, up to northern Minnesota, up to the smaller communities in northern Minnesota. The subsidies, for the most part, went away with deregulation. There was this thing called the Essential Air Services Provision, which was put in. but for the most part, the, airlines needed to find a new model for collecting people from smaller communities. in the old days when there was, when there were aircraft suited to this and there was in some cases subsidy, in some cases a cost structure that allowed airlines to serve these smaller, that was what happened. Very quickly, a company like Northcentral, which now had the freedom to grow, ended up actually merging with a couple of smaller airlines and became an entity, a brand called Republic. They could no longer, and I was around, this is when I got in the business in 1984 they could no longer serve these points economically, these small communities economically. And so they then began, they then turned to these regional airlines that operated on a franchise model, right? Paint your airplanes to look like ours, sign a contract to conform to service standards. We'll take care of of setting the prices, we'll take care of running the commercial side. You get involved with the operational side. And as in the regional airline ecosystem, there's a bunch of different models for how those companies get paid. But for the most part, nowadays, it's what's called fee per departure where the company, whether it's SkyWest or whomever, Air Wisconsin, they get paid. For every flight they, every flight they run and the airline takes care of collecting all the revenue and managing it. And that model got built out. That model really starts to be built not long after deregulation and in, and in fact, some forward thinking, larger airlines like American with their American Eagle brand, and United, with, I think they called it United Express from the get go, starting to franchise with these independent operators, to provide service to these smaller communities, and the whole thing takes off and, 40 years later, we now have this network, that, has evolved, works pretty well, but, as you guys, as you just suggested, has some problems related to the economics of small jet aircraft related to, the salary structures for these smaller companies, so on and so forth. I, again, my sunny optimism says that, a lot of these issues that were being talked about with a lot of vigor five or eight or 10 years ago, about pilot shortages in the regional sector, are for the most part being sorted out and the way it gets sorted out is by raising their salaries. And these companies are able to do that and continue to provide, the kind of service that people want. So the, in the regional environment, I mean, if you think about, if you think about small cities, small communities, small and medium sized communities in the United States, my sense is that the system works pretty well. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well. And there are just for all I've, while I've got this, there have been a number of different models. that have been tried. I mentioned, the so called essential air services model that the federal government administers, which basically is, for the most part, a failure. To me, when we're talking about regional air service, the most successful model in my view is something called the minimum revenue guarantee. And this concept was actually pioneered in resort towns in the Mountain West that were seeking to have a greater sense of reliable air service. And so I believe that the first resort towns that pursued this is winter resort towns, were Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Vail, Colorado. And this goes back to the late eighties or early nineties, and they contracted with American and American came up with this minimum revenue guarantee concept. They said, well, how much service do you want from where? And they said, well, you know what we want one flight from Dallas, one from Chicago, blah, blah, blah, blah. So American came up with it with a number that they needed, which was basically their costs probably with, and with some baked in profit. And they gave them the number and they said to the resort and it was usually done through a chamber of commerce or a local economic development authority or some either private or public private partnership. They said, look, here's the number. we'll market the flights. We'll sell the flights. And at the end of the year, we'll just do the numbers. And if you meet the revenue threshold, you're golden and if you don't, you write us a check to make us whole. The interesting thing about those, the way those structures are is that, as I recall, the airline didn't give anything back if they wildly exceeded the guarantee. So, and they started, so they started out doing this for tourism destinations, and then they widened it out and, for example, one of the more recent just ordinary communities was a place called Roswell, New Mexico, town of, I don't know, 20,000 people in eastern New Mexico. This goes back about a dozen years, and at that point, rather than American doing it with their mainline, because their, those planes would have been too big, they did it through their Eagle Regional Airline, and it was the same concept they said to the city of Roswell or whoever it was out there that was doing this. Look, here's what we need. And off they went, and it has worked spectacularly well. It's worked so well, in fact, that the initial service pattern was from Roswell East to the big hub in Dallas, Fort Worth. And I believe, and you could check the schedules, but I believe that they've since built it out to it, to have at least one or two flights from Los Angeles of all places. So, here's this little town and the dusty high plains of New Mexico with pretty nice connectivity. That model has been very successful and has in fact been used by a number of other airlines. And just to finish that concept off, you guys may be aware there's actually a number of consulting firms that work with local communities to try to build air service. And this minimum revenue guarantee. concept is just one of the many things that are in their arsenal. And these are both for sort of tourism dependent communities, as well as, as well as just sort of ordinary places. So that's an interesting concept. What I like about it is it's a market based concept. It's not something, where the government's going to come in, where there's going to be a lot of political shenanigans and pork belly, pork barrel stuff. And so it's a nice solution and it has been very successful for the communities that have pursued it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>How prevalent is the use of that mechanism today?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, it's still, and so the other, so carrying that forward, one of the interesting things is that in a number of these, resort communities they started off with the minimum revenue guarantee and they were just able to be weaned off of it because, you know, the market, the route got built up, the service got built up, so on and so forth. In addition to American, I, quite honestly guys, I don't know who else is pursuing it besides, yeah, I'm pretty sure that Alaska Airlines has, I don't know if they're still doing it in the winter from, I believe, Seattle into some of the interior ski destinations in British Columbia, a place called Kamloops, which has a couple of, smaller, but growing ski resorts. And then the other people that are using it, I believe in Canada, in Eastern Canada is Porter. You may know about them, Porter Airlines. they, they're, historically a Q400 operator, but now they've just recently taken delivery of E195s and are building out their service pattern. But Porter was running, I believe, a minimum revenue guarantee into a number of ski resorts in Quebec and in Eastern Canada.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So we talked about regional air travel, how they came to exist, and the kinds of pressures that they have started to feel over the last maybe two decades or so. What's your assessment of the current state of regional air travel, and are you seeing opportunity in new technology, whether this is electric propulsion or increasing autonomy to remove some of the economic pressure that caused the contraction of this segment?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>My sense is that if we think about conventional small jet technology, I think the service patterns that, companies like SkyWest or Air Wisconsin or the owned subsidiaries like Delta's, company Endeavor. That whole thing seems to be fairly stable. And again, I'm, I confess I'm a little bit removed from some of the to and fro on that, but I'm not seeing, for example, in the airline, trade publications, the industry publications like Aviation Week or Aviation Day. I'm not really seeing, people squawking about pilot shortage and so on and so forth. And as I suggested earlier on in the conversation, I think that, a lot of the pilot shortage of 5, 6, 10 years ago was really related to money. Once they've given these guys a raise and a signing bonus, they don't seem to be having much trouble attracting young pilots into the system. And I know for a fact that all of the regionals recruit very heavily in those universities that have ab initio pilot training programs, like the University of North Dakota or the University of Nebraska, Omaha, and. there's a handful of schools that, four year universities that do that. So I think that's, so full stop, let's shift now and, look at the new technology on the horizon. And, even though some of it seems, a bit further out, it's pretty clear that, companies like Heart, Aerospace in Sweden, building out these 30 passenger hybrid, aircraft. I think this is very exciting because my sense and I haven't seen any data, but my sense just maybe in a very simplistic sense as an owner of a hybrid automobile my sense is that the economics of a hybrid aircraft with a, 30 passenger and, I'm sure once they're successful with that, they'll build it up to, 50 is very exciting. And so you've got that as just sort of hybrid propulsion, the, and again, my knowledge of the players is small, but there's, I know that there's a handful of people that are building out, a pure battery solution, in a, in a smaller package. And that stuff, I mean, that's all very exciting because I think that, that will at least start to attack the, fuel related part of operating into small communities with, with RJs. The interesting thing, if we take this sort of long view of regional service, long being say 40 years, if we go back and look at the operating economics of a, of an airplane, like the Saab 340, that was a very economical airplane to operate in terms of fuel burn, 30 passengers, as I recall, something like that, and then, the, the pure jet aircraft that Bombardier was delivering started to come on and Embraer and, you know, all of a sudden those became very popular. But you know, What happens when oil spikes up? A lot of those aircrafts start to get a little bit marginal, especially in the 50 seat range. So, so the new technology, whether hybrid or pure battery, I think will at least address, some of the energy related issues. And if that's addressed and the labor issues are sort of sorted out, then I think, the prospect looks pretty bright. And indeed, depending on, where things go with, with autonomous, operation, you could start to see something looking very attractive in terms of being able to serve smaller communities. I mean, to me, it's not entirely impossible to foresee a regional airline map that looked more like what it did in the regulated period when all that service was so massively subsidized. So that let's say a city of 10 or 15, 000 people in the Great Plains could expect to have connectivity to a major hub.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, do you think that the hybrid or electric capability why should they better serve those communities in the future? If they're profitable routes, today they could be served from a gas turbine engine. Why do they have to be electric or hybrid?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>no, yeah, I'm not, yeah, I'm not sure I was clear enough. No, what I think I was saying is that for example, a hybrid airplane might be able to provide, supplemental service to, a city that has jet service, so imagine, I don't know, I'm going to take an example. Let's take, let's take Bismarck, North Dakota, the capital of North Dakota. They probably enjoy, I haven't, I'm looking at a schedule, but Delta Connection flies to Bismarck, probably four times a day, five times a day from Minneapolis, St. Paul, from their big hub there. Maybe with a hybrid aircraft, they could serve, they could add some trips in the middle of the day. Alternately, there might be the possibility that the attractive, energy economics of these newer, of this new technology might allow a service to places that don't have it today that would very much like to have it. And you could conceive of a combination of what we spoke about a moment ago, a minimum revenue guarantee. So now let's go down to a, a very small city of say 15, 000 people, and maybe it's just an ordinary place. Maybe it's a resort place or a tourism dependent place. Now they could contract with SkyWest or Air Wisconsin or whomever to bring in a 30 passenger hybrid airplane into a very small place. So you might actually see more dots on the map. And again, hard to know where we would be, but at least what I know about the, the potential economics of these things, that would be, that's not infeasible. So I hope, does that help a little bit?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>does, thanks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, has Heart announced what their efficiency gain or operating cost will be for that 30 person aircraft? I mean, I'm curious as what is it relative to like a narrow body jet, like a 737 or an A320, and what is it relative to another 30 person aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I don't know what that is, but I would encourage you to look. I just, I remember about four or five months ago, I was actually, I was teaching over in Europe and somebody mentioned, they said, there's this Swedish company that's working. So I dug it out and I looked very briefly at their website. So I'd encourage you to, they're called Heart Aerospace and they're in Gothenburg, Sweden. and I bet they've got some, I mean, there's probably some promises there, and as you guys know, it's always once the aircraft is in service that where you really see whether it's actually performing to the promised economics, and I could tell you a lot of funny stories about that, in conventional aircraft, but, I suspect it's going to be a pretty significant, efficiency gain and especially vis a vis, anything in that category. And, the problem guys is that basically that 30 passenger, aircraft size has basically gone away. There's nobody, there's almost nobody flying something like that anymore. I mean, there's a couple of small operators that are keeping, Beach 1900s in the air that are about, 20 passengers. So, they might find a niche is\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is it because the market doesn't exist?

I mean, I think that, you could look at the small end of a regional aircraft and there's really nothing there anymore. And so I, I think that they're onto something. With a, with a 30 seat airplane. And I have to believe that they'd, once they prove that they'd build it out to a larger capacity. And if they do that, I think they're going to have economics. it's a turboprop as I understand it. and if it's a speedy turboprop, the block times into a, you know, on a 200 or 300 mile service are going to be pretty comparable to a pure jet.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp>CHAT GPT says it's a 30 percent reduction in operating cost compared to traditional regional jets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, there you have\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>true, then it must be\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, that's exactly right.

Assuming that new technology comes online and now we have electrified aircraft that, lower the cost per flight or a per mile, whatever is more relevant for regional air travel. And, and this value generated for airline, how does the airline get to keep that value? Do we end up in a situation where the business model changes, where OEMs become the operators, and now they have this privileged access to this cornered resource, and they get to keep the added profits. Or will it be, everybody has access to these aircraft, so now we're back to the usual, low profitability airline models. How do you think that this will change the structure of the network and the overall profit distribution along the value chain?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, that's a super interesting question, guys. and, the, I was smiling when you, and when you introduced it, because, one of the things that I tell my business school students is that if we look at the commercial aviation value chain, once you get to the people that actually operate the stuff, there's not much left over. It's all the other guys that are taking, their generous slices of the pie. but you throw out a really intriguing idea, that, I mean, you'd have to go back to, almost to the dawn of commercial aviation when there were in fact OEMs that were the operators. That model does not exist, has not existed, and it's an intriguing idea. I suspect at the end of the day, and again, who knows, I've never been very good at prediction, but at the end of the day, even though the concept might be there, the notion that the manufacturer would actually then become the operator, I don't know, it's a little tricky. Just because I think, the OEMs, they could conceivably go in and say, okay, we're gonna, we're going to operate, let's take, let's just muse for a moment, since this is a thought experiment, let's just muse for a moment and say that these guys Heart they're building airplanes in Sweden. And Sweden is a geographically large, but empty country central places, there are small cities of 10 or 20, 000 people throughout the country that want to get to Stockholm to go shopping or see a show or whatever, do business in the capital. So you could conceive that Heart would say, we're going to make the airplane and we're going to operate the airplane in Sweden, right? And so, they get an operating license from, the Swedish government and they start flying. It's conceivable they could make that work, but at the same time, they're going to want to sell that airplane globally. And I can't foresee that, a relatively small company is going to want to ramp up. There's nothing that would keep them from doing that, but would want to ramp up and become, if you will, a global operator, all over with, with operating licenses and, 20, 30, 40 countries, but it's not out of the question. I mean, but it's a interesting possibility. If we look at the history of commercial aviation, though, I think we see a situation where, the, what was that, the wonderful phrase that one of the, business savants of the early 80s, always talked about, maybe it was Jack Welch or somebody like that, always talked about stick to the knitting. In other words, let's focus on doing the things that we know how to do best. And so, the OEMs make the airplanes and the commercial airlines operate them and there's not much in between. But again, nothing to keep them from trying that out as a model.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What do you think, needs to happen either with technology or the market side that would enable and accelerate the point to point network topology as opposed to the hub and spoke?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, well, I think that I think you're already seeing some successful business models here in the United States, airline business models, where the point to point, is the nature of the route structure. and it's, it's basically David Neeleman with Breeze and, and the guys at Avelo both of those companies, which, I always like to point out to my students, my Either in a moment of incredible bravery or stupidity, both of those airlines took wing during the pandemic and they're growing like crazy, right? And, they have picked out opportunistic places like New Haven, Connecticut and Burbank, California, Hollywood, Burbank Airport for Avelo. Neeleman is getting as big as he can in, in Westchester County, but as that airport is constrained, but he's finding these places where, you've got a pool of, a pool of, middle class, upper middle class, well to do people that want to travel and that they don't want to drive to and get stuck in traffic, making their way to LAX or JFK or whatever. So, so you're seeing some of this going on. Now, the reality is that, as the hub and spoke behemoths, Delta, United and American, every time they get a new regional jet or, either it's one of their owned companies or a franchise, every time one of those new aircraft are delivered, the economics of a hub say, put it into the hub and add another spoke. But these point to point guys are out there in the thing about, and where Breeze and Avelo are different is Avelo is, strictly single aircraft type 737 800. but Neeleman has found the sweet spot with the astonishing economics of the A220. and that plane has just astonishingly low seat mile costs. My friend, Ben Baldanza, who is on the JetBlue board we were having coffee a couple of years ago and we were talking about the A220 because JetBlue is now putting it into service, replacing their E190s. And their, the seat mile cost of the A220 is like 50 percent of what the E190 was. So with economics like that you're probably going to end with the capability of that airplane it's not just low seat mount cost. It's the fact that airplane has the range capability to go coast to coast. Neeleman is flying Breeze airplanes from Westchester to San Francisco and and Los Angeles. And so you can conceive of people looking at, at flows, traffic flows in the United States and finding, and this is what, I mean, Neeleman is doing this right now with the A220, finding, what's the next opportunity? And I think you could probably foresee some other people wanting to jump into that business with that particular airplane, because it is so capable and so economic and, we're, we're, we could conceivably see some additional sort of conventional, if you will, jet, turbine powered jet aircraft like that. But, we're starting, as you guys know, we're starting to approach, the laws of thermodynamics in terms of how much more efficiency can we extract from a gas turbine engine but, it's conceivable that somebody might get in and, build an airplane that's maybe even smaller than an A220, maybe it's a hybrid airplane, the, people are, people are clever and they're finding new things to do.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, I'd like to get your thoughts on the viability of the on demand airline model. There have been many attempts in the past, none really successful, yet entrepreneurs continue to try. Do you think the assets can be utilized enough to make these on-demand routes possible? Are new, cheaper aircraft the solution, or is it a structural problem that's tough to fix?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think it's a, I think it's tough to fix. I think you could see a way to have a limited success in, a small array of markets. And the problem with that is that, you then need to find demand that only needs to go in those limited numbers of markets, so people traveling up and down between Los Angeles and the Bay Area, I don't even know if that on demand outfit is still flying out on the way out in those markets in California. I mean, it could exist. It's limited. And you get other kinds of, you get other kinds of on demand models. I mean, if we're talking about, for example, Wheels Up, that Delta has just sunk a bunch more money into, you just wonder about whether they can, whether they can actually make that work vis a vis, the other kinds of, models that, that exist in, if you will, business aviation, the NetJets and the rest of those kinds of things. I mean, Wheels Up, if you look at their, if you look at their concept, if you look at their website, you look at thinking, well, there's got to be a market for that. And yet, they've struggled. I think to be honest with you guys, just not to, I know a little bit about them because I was working for a couple of years with a marketing professor at Wharton that I know very well. And we had, he was wanting to write a, Harvard case study about Wheels Up. And so we had a bunch of conversations with their chief marketing officer. It was pretty clear that even though they might have had a pretty good concept, they didn't really have an idea of how to go in and tap the market. So I, I think that, I think what ends up happening, and I think maybe to your question, Luka, about sort of structural issues. I mean, I, I'm a, most of my career in the airline business has been on the marketing and planning side. And I just, I think to myself, there's just, there's something about these on demand services that it just somehow, it's not a question of awareness because the people who are very affluent, that can afford to, travel this way, know about these things, but they've never been able to really get traction. So, I don't know, but having said that, if you put that, if you put the on demand concept together with, the array of new technology that's coming at us at a fairly rapid clip, you may possibly see in the future, some of these companies beginning to get traction, depending on how they do it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So given that you're talking about regional immobility, you're talking about on demand, how do you see the next 10 years playing out? What's a high probability occurrence as it relates to the commercial airlines, the introduction of electric hybrid, potentially eVTOL, STOL. And, what do you think is likely to occur\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, yeah, step one is that all of this stuff that's being developed, has to be built, and it has to be certified. And you guys know that, certification is not an easy task, these guys will get there. And so once the stuff is built and certified, I, I think you're going to find buyers. I mean, there are, as the big players have made token investments in a lot of this new technology, and so, they're, people are ready for this stuff. If we take it down to the scale of the regional network, I think it's, it's, it's my sense is that it's sort of field of dreams if you build it, they will come if somebody is out there and I'll just come back to Heart for a minute because I'm much taken with this idea of a hybrid. if they start delivering this airplane and it's, it's fulfilling the economics that, that they're doing. I think you're going to see some interesting stuff, but, I don't know, guys, I, maybe it's the function of fact that I'm 72 years old, but, 10 years, it strikes me that things in commercial aviation tend to move fairly slowly. So, I could foresee that by 2034 we're not going to see revolutionary changes, and especially, if we start to look at, you know, UAM and stuff like that, where there's just so many institutional barriers, so many political barriers, the, as you guys know, the pilot union is already spending a lot of money in Washington saying, we're never going to, you guys can never allow a commercial aircraft, no matter how big or small, to be operated without people piloting it, right? So there's just, you just, I tend to be, and maybe it's a function of the fact that I live 10 miles from the capital of the Republic and all the regulatory and political apparatus, but I'm a little bit skeptical about some of that stuff. So, I don't know. I think we're gonna, I think if I crystal ball 2034, I'm going to see some interesting changes on the margin, but I'm not seeing anything really revolutionary.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, decarbonization aside, what are some of the most important challenges that the airline industry is facing and grappling with today that, we'll need to find a solution to in the coming years?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I think that, for older companies, whether we're talking about the three legacies in the United States, and certainly all of the older companies in Europe, the labor cost issue, has been, for 50 years or longer and continues to be, a big deal. Right. And, you've got powerful trade unions, that, that have a lock, and institutionalized and guaranteed through law lock on contracts with legacy carriers here and in Europe and, they all want more money. And so you've got, that, that is, to me, again, as a long time observer for older companies, that's absolutely where it is, it's the cost pressures continue to be there. What else has gone on? I mean, we've, we simply have to, and I don't want to minimize this because it's huge. We simply have to find a way in the United States to split off, as they have done in most other industrial countries, the air traffic control function. the whole ATC system is held together with duct tape and bailing wire. And it's just, it's just got to be modernized and it will never be modernized under the current regime of being operated by the FAA. Now, you got Yeah,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:16:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp>separate podcast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:16:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>it is a problem. Yeah, absolutely. And I'd be happy to come back and yak with you about that. But that's a, that's a huge one as well. and then, what else is going on? I mean, you've got infrastructure challenges in, all of the big airports, there's not enough runway capacity, there's not enough terminal capacity, and so, the, Pete Buttigieg's solution to that is, well, let's, let's constrain the legacy carriers from continuing to grow at O'Hare or Kennedy or whatever, rather than the obvious solution is let's build more aviation infrastructure. But of course, politically, they can't do that because, there's, all these people whining about carbon emissions and all the rest of that. So, it's just, to sort of conclude, it continues to be a fascinating industry because there is just so many moving parts, not the least of which is the continued intrusiveness of national governments and the operation of the industry.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You've been given a hundred million dollars and you have to invest it in the industry. The return has to come within 10 years. What's going to get the bulk of the investment? What's not going to get any investment?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Wow. I, I get it. I think it depends, I think that's a really hard question to, to answer because it depends on who's holding the wallet with the hundred million dollars in it, right? I mean, if it's a, if it's a legacy carrier, they're gonna buy, they're gonna buy increasingly fuel efficient and capable new aircraft at the, at the larger size of the spectrum. So, the A350 or whatever, they're gonna buy A321s in the middle size. They're probably gonna start to build out more of these A220 smaller aircraft. if you're a, if you're a startup, and you're holding the 100 million wallet, you're gonna, you're gonna be buying, A220s, and you're going to be buying, these, these new, these newer propulsion technologies, hybrids or pure battery to the extent that they're able to be demonstrated to be effective and safe and stuff. And so, I wish I could be more, I wish I could be more articulate there, but as you guys know, I'm not a finance guy.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, but you're a lot. Listen, there are a lot of people listening, Rob, who may not know you, who are thinking, this guy's unbelievable. And they're, they think this podcast is a great discussion. Talk, tell a little bit about what you're doing today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I still do, a little bit of consulting in the sector. And I think that the companies that come to me, are people that want a holistic understanding of how the airline business works somebody with some gravitas and gray hair, and I have a gray hair, not very much of it. But I, I'm, I'm a person that when I approach a, a challenge when I'm given a business problem by a big company like Delta or a smaller manufacturer or a startup software company, I try to look at the problem holistically and I try to bring together, marshal together all of the experience that I have, in understanding how the airline business works. So, if somebody comes to me with this, what they believe to be an absolutely sterling idea about to, bewilderingly new technology. I have to give them a cautionary tale about certification and how long it takes to get stuff done by the government. So, so that's the sort of put over on that side. The other thing that I really do apart from, what takes up a lot of my time and that's being a invited guest lecturer in business school classrooms because I derive an enormous amount of joy from that. But the other thing that I do on the consulting side is, people hire me to explain how the business works to newcomers. And so just as an example of that, one of the big legacies, brought me in a year ago because they had just brought some new VPs on board that had come from outside of, the airline business and they needed to get up to speed very quickly. And that's what I do. I can explain how, airlines work. And so I sort of can deliver an Airlines 101 to an airline company, to a supplier, to an airport. I'm doing, that's, yeah, so that's kind of what I do.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>do it, you would do it very effectively, just based on our talk, Rob.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>thank you. so much.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You've been doing this for a while, as you've reminded us. Who are some people that have knocked you over in the last 50 years who you think are the top couple in the industry? And then who are some people today that you pay a lot of attention to?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I think, look, I don't know either. I don't know the Avelo guys at all. I, the guy that's the CEO is the former chief financial officer of United. I don't, but he, those people are obviously very brave people. They're knocking me over right now frankly, the whole decision to build out New Haven Airport is just, to me, is just a total stroke of genius. Neeleman with Breeze. I mean, here's a guy that started off in Utah with a little company called Morris Air, sold it to Southwest, started JetBlue, built Jet blew up, left JetBlue, started Azul in Brazil. I mean, this guy's a, he's a, he's a complete, clever guy. And, and there's a lot of other people that are like that, that, that are there that, some of the, the older guys that have been around for a long time, all the, the senior guys at Indigo, have an amazing track record. if I, to be honest, and maybe this is a good place to end, without getting myself in trouble with them place where I used to work at American. I look at Ed Bastian at Delta, is, and his leadership team, are absolutely building, a remarkable company. And, the, yeah, they had a, they had a huge, set back with the whole, the whole cybersecurity blow up with CrowdStrike a month ago. But that's a, and that was painful and it was a ding on their brand, but by and large, their trajectory has been forward and they are producing, probably the world's most consistent airline product. So those are guys that, that I look at. And again, those are all people on the operating side, because that's kind of where I spend most of my time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What have we not asked that you would like to answer?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think you've covered, we've covered a lot. and I've really, I've really enjoyed it. and it's been, it's been a great conversation. If I can help out in the future, you know where to find me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I do have one quick question, there's a lot of entrepreneurs in the audience. Where would you advise them to go and innovate in the aviation value chain?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I would advise them to go and innovate in places that are realistic. I mean, you guys know that, billions and billions, have been and continue to be invested in, in these new technologies and not all these guys are succeeding. And so we're starting to see shaking out in, in eVTOL and a lot of this other stuff that's there. So if you've got entrepreneurs that are looking to invest, my, my guidance is just be very careful about this and don't believe, the pitch deck, and when you talk to the people and listen to the pitch deck, ask some really hard questions based on the fact that, we're already seeing, a lot of the companies that have attracted billions in venture capital, going belly up. So I, I'm a, I'm a believer in prudence. And I think prudence is a good thing when you've got money to invest.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Maybe that's the headline.

You don't have to worry about passenger egress necessarily, or passenger comforts that don't necessarily play a role in the cargo market. If I was to focus on one area, I'd say that's where the most significant gain for us will be, is products that are really designed around our needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>2:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Welcome back to The Vertical Space, we hope everyone is enjoying their summer, and welcome to our conversation with Jeff Luckett, President and one of the founding members of UPS Flight Forward, a wholly owned UPS Subsidiary. Since our beginning back in 21, we've had a lot of OEMs and providers of services on the podcast, both in advanced air mobility as well as in more traditional aviation. It's always special to hear from people like Jeff and the organizations they represent the buyers and recipients of the value of these organizations making products and services. At the end of the day, it's organizations like UPS who are driving the demand. It's their use cases, their business challenges and opportunities and their cash that drives the funding and building of these vehicles and services. And with UPS, we're talking to one of the trailblazers and leaders and with Jeff, we're talking to their leader as the President of UPS Flight Forward. So listen to this. Jeff talks about evaluating over 850 different companies to determine those who could best meet UPS', challenges and opportunities. So, I bet you want to hear about how he differentiated those who made the cut and those who didn't and what advice he would give to those companies. A consistent theme throughout our discussion are the requirements of cargo centric operations. And the importance of listening to these unique requirements when marketing to organizations like UPS. Jeff believes and he is in the company of many that it's the cargo market that is more likely to more substantially materialize in the early years versus the passenger taxi markets. Jeff starts off discussing what happens on the ground is as important as what's going on in the air. And when you think about the UPS mission, and after listening to Jeff's explanation, you'll have a better understanding as to why. Listen to when Jeff sees his future state aircraft entering service and when he expects them to scale. An important consideration, Jeff discusses why UPS decides to insource and outsource its operations key to understanding some of the roles of future advanced air mobility operations. I like how Jeff describes UPS's role and appetite to invest in integrating aircraft into the NAS and his response draws upon the successful role UPS played with the introduction of ADS-B. So many thanks to Jeff for joining us and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Jeff Luckett as you innovate profitably and The Vertical Space. Jeff Luckett is President and one of the founding members of UPS Flight Forward, a wholly-owned UPS subsidiary incorporated on June 14, 20 19 established to work with regulators and OEMs to move the UAS advanced air mobility industry forward. On September 27th, 2019, UPS Flight Forward became the first company to receive a standard 1 35 air carrier certificate, approved by the FAA for UAS operations and has continued to be an industry leader, accomplishing many of the industry firsts occurring in the US, including the first Part 1 35 UAS revenue delivery in 2019 and the first Part 1 35 UAS revenue BVLOS delivery in 2023. Jeff's responsibilities also include oversight of the UPS Airline Technology Support Group. Prior to his current leadership roles, Jeff's 34 plus year career at UPS has covered several areas, including UPS Airline Flight Operations, Engineering, Network Planning, Long Range Planning and Aircraft Acquisitions. Jeff has also held supporting roles with the UPS Airline Emergency Response Team, DOD CRAF Program and Humanitarian Air Relief Charters. Jeff graduated from University of Louisville and has an MBA in Aviation from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He also served two tours of duty in the U S Navy during the first Gulf War. Jeff, welcome to The Vertical Space. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Great to be on with you all today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes, there's a couple things I could highlight. First, I would say we entered the space and we're really interacting primarily, initially, on the small UAS side, and we believed all along that the lessons that we learn in the small UAS space would apply and help inform, the shift to larger AAM solutions, and we're seeing that, but that was some resistance, I think, we felt early on. The other thing I would highlight is that we believe that the importance of what happens from touchdown to takeoff, is as critically important as what happens in the air for us with the solutions being developed. We're seeing a lot of technology companies develop great solutions that do incredible things in the air, autonomously and sustainable, but it's the solutions that also have to take place for the ground, For it to make sense for us and to be economically viable.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Thanks. Jeff. Talk about smaller UAS and why that was your focus.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So our initial pass at small UAS was kind of dictated by guidelines. So, under 55 pounds was really that initial focus. And we looked at aircraft that fell under that FAA limit at the time and that still had a meaningful payload and range for us. So, really when we think small UAS, it's things for more final mile campus delivery type solutions in a reasonably small geographic area.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I would probably say many listening would be a little bit surprised that UPS, that was the focus because you've created so much noise in the larger spectrum. And then what you're saying is the ground operation is as almost important as the air. Talk about that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Okay. and just the, I guess to go back to the previous question, small UAS was what we were able to do first. there are still no AAM solutions type certified. So it wasn't that we weren't looking at them, but it was a matter of what we had available to us to use. But as we jumped in and started going after those small UAS operations we had to form partnerships and, get that kicked off, but we worked with Matternet on that initial, small UAS, stand up. And that was how we went about getting our Part 135 certificate partnered with Matternet. And that is still our only aircraft on our certificate.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Matternet we've had them on the podcast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Excellent.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So talk about the ground operations. One thing you're doing different is the on to in, the out to off is an area that you're focused on and for some they'll understand why, but talk about that briefly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Sure. So when we look at our current day operations, they're still very labor intensive. And when I say that, we do have the ability to do BVLOS now, but even with that unlock, we have crew members at the ends of each route. The Matternet, as we use it today, requires us to load and unload the aircraft, do pre flight, post flight type inspections, and, reload, batteries for flight. So with all those things in mind, it's still a very labor intensive operation. So we want to see things progress in the industry that allow lighter lift on the ends of the route. And we know Matternet's working on solutions today, and in their Swiss operation, they've got a station that the aircraft interacts with, and that's, moving the direction we're thinking. But, in general, we just need to see the ability to automate more of the process on the ground.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Thank you, Jeff. What are the origins of the mission of UPS Flight Forward? How did it come about and why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Our origins really, we've been an airline now for quite some time, a 121 airline. And as the company leadership started to acknowledge that things are changing and that there's new technologies coming to this industry, that was recognized and a small team was asked to tackle this new frontier, if you will. So UPS Flight Forward was pulled together from a small group of subject matter experts from our 121 Airline. We initially stood up operations, from a part 107 perspective. We pursued our Part 135 certificate and formed a new company, a wholly owned UPS subsidiary. And as all that came together, I would say part of the origin was from an ask from the FAA. The FAA asked us to participate, and we joined the, IPP program in North Carolina as that avenue to help us, integrate into this new space. So, partly an FAA ask and partly leadership acknowledging these new technologies coming to the market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Jeff, as you looked at this new technology to solve some of the problems that UPS is facing, can you talk about what those main pain points are that UPS was trying to solve with this new generation of aviation.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, when we look at current day operations, we're challenged with aging aircraft, pilot shortages, which some will debate that topic. Even our own 121 Airline, they've got a line of pilots out the door. But when you look at feeder aircraft operations, part 135 operations, they're challenged every day because as people get their hours, they're moving on, up into, to 121 operations. So we still see that as a problem. And in fact, COVID amplified it because we saw furloughs happen during that time. It delayed training and set back the industry in some ways, and it's still catching up. there were people that chose not to enter that field during COVID because of the scale back, and I don't think we've caught up as an industry. So, the pilot shortages is a key piece, and then just cost in general. What we're seeing is year over year costs increasing fairly significantly, for our small feeder aircraft operations. So these solutions bring new things to the table that can help offset those costs. And we know we're going to have to address some of the aging aircraft, as it stands today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And the impact of the pilot shortage is that more stuff is being moved in the ground or what's the impact of this?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Part of it's cost. I mean, I'd say the biggest driver there is cost, because you're having to pay more to keep people in seats, rather than them progressing onto the 121 space. So, cost is a big piece. we are having, in some cases, we do look at ground as an alternative, but we're a time definite business. So when our next day product arrives at a jet gateway out in our system, if it can't make it on the ground in time, that's where we leverage that feeder aircraft network and it's how we maintain that service to our customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The feeder part of that chain of moving cargo is where most of the problem is today. Is that correct?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we look at the solutions that are coming to market and things we're trying to solve for, I'd say that is the biggest problem that we're looking at today, yes. There's also another angle that we're digging into, and that's new revenue opportunities. One of the challenges that we will have as an industry is paying for the new tech. And if we're just putting it in as a plug and play, to existing operations, that may not be all we need, because our current utilization, these aircraft are based around one rotation a night for our next day product. And that may not support, the cost requirement for these new aircraft. So we're looking at ways to leverage these new technologies and new fleets of aircraft to support new revenue opportunities and potentially offset costs elsewhere.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And just to paint a more vivid picture of how urgent these problems need to be solved, or at least what's the perception at UPS, on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the urgency to introduce these new technologies to solve some of the problems that you're talking about?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Great question. It depends on who you talk to. Within our organization, we're a company of 500, 000 employees and a global footprint. We service 200 countries. So, the feeder aircraft piece of the equation is small in the grand scheme, but it is important. we currently vendor out our aircraft. So, we're relying on that vendor fleet, to support our current feeder aircraft needs. And what we're seeing in that market space is consolidation of both operators, as well as some of the aircraft leaving the market. And I think that's becoming a driver. So we need a solution. And again, if you talk to airline staff that are familiar with our feeder aircraft network, I'd say it's going to fall on the higher end of the importance and then, those that are dealing with the ground volume, probably won't see it as big of a priority, but, again, we're a large organization and I think it's relevant, which party you're talking to and understanding, the needs to make service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If the business justification for the feeder network is the priority, and we talk about the small UAS to start and then larger vehicles afterwards what are the 2 or 3 areas of the next 3 to 5 years where you're saying we're going to get the greatest financial return, and from what vehicles and what would the return be?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The first bet we've placed is on Beta. We were interested in engaging in the eVTOL Space, and when we look at the aircraft available in the market that are coming to market. We needed something that could hit our mission requirements, and our contract was based on 250 miles of range, a good payload and a volume that was meaningful to us. We know we may not hit all those targets, with the first delivered version of the aircraft. Battery energy density is changing and improving year over year. But what we do know is that from a volume standpoint, the aircraft can hit some of the marks that we need on the lower end of our feeder aircraft spectrum. And what that does for us is in today's world, I mentioned if we fly our next day volume, if it comes through our hub and leaves here on a jet, those jets land at regional airports servicing cities, and once those land, if we can ground the volume on time to its destination, that's what we do. That's typically the cheapest way to handle it. But if you can't, and you have to put that volume on a feeder aircraft, that aircraft is going to fly from that jet gateway to a GA airport in a smaller, super rural town. When it lands, there's going to be a vehicle meet that aircraft, they're going to hand off load the aircraft onto a vehicle, and it's going to drive to one of our centers. And at that center, the volume would be sorted down to the package cars for delivery. In future state, what we would do is take an eVTOL directly from that aircraft arrival, and fly to the center where the volume needs to go. So we take a ground segment out of the mix and reduce the handles of the packages, which we see as a financial benefit on both. And a potential time savings for the network. When we look at other solutions, so we are looking at, retrofitting existing aircraft as well, so there are a lot of missions that we're not going to cover with an eVTOL in today's world, just because of the amount of volume, the payloads required, and the ranges. So for those solutions, retrofitted aircraft may be a great way for us to move forward. And as you look at the industry landscape, many are focused on the Cessna Caravan, and that's a workhorse of our feeder aircraft network. It is still in production, which makes it even more attractive. And there's solutions that are going to help advance both autonomy capabilities for those aircraft and sustainable power plants. So we think, really, there's a great opportunity for savings there and efficiency. When you look at the cost of operating feeder aircraft, and I'm going to generalize this very high level so, those in the industry can dig into the numbers. They may see something slightly different, but high level, if you take the variable costs that we deal with daily and bucket those, you can roughly, create buckets that tie 20 percent to crew, 20 percent to maintenance, and 20 percent of fuel. And that 60%, roughly, of the grand total, are numbers that we can influence with some of these new technologies. So I think that's really a focal point for us when we look at those retrofitted aircraft, taking advantage of something that already exists. But making it better and more efficient. So those are, when we look at eVTOLs and then traditional aircraft, I think that's the two approaches that you'll see us focus on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>19:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Okay, Jeff. And when you look across these different types of aircraft, given how you're going to employ them in your operations, which, what I interpret as, improving the end quality of service, increasing efficiency and saving cost, looking at the different aircraft, what is the early end of the time window when those aircraft will actually deliver the bottom line savings, given their own evolution and scale up and the refinement of their operations? And then what are the other aircraft that are at the outer end of that timeline and how far out is that when those things are going to be delivering these savings for your use case.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So when we look at the industry landscape today, everything's going to be predicated on type certification. When will the FAA approve these solutions? Clean sheet aircraft, in general, I would, will expect to take longer. We've been partnered now with Beta since, 2019 ish timeframe. So, that aircraft is evolving, the production line is there, and they're going to start pushing aircraft out the end, by the end of this year. So, those are happening, but you still have to get through that type certification process. When we look at the retrofit side, those aircraft exist and they're basically going after STCs. So, at least to scale, I think that some of the STCs may move faster than clean sheet aircraft just because more of the aircraft's already accepted, but we hope that they run in parallel. I think you've probably heard about Innovate28 and some of those initiatives to get aircraft moving, in that time horizon with the FAA. And, for me, the 2026 to 2028 time frame is when we expect to see these aircraft entering service and, starting to do meaningful routes in the network and then scaling up from there. So, I don't know if that helps give you the color you're looking for.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>21:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It does. It helps me sort of think about the company's time horizon, in terms of your expectations. And can you walk us through when you decided to embark on this, how you thought about, hey, let's lean in and be an early adopter of this and, in a way, pioneer the operations versus, I'm sure there's another school of thought, in the space that says, hey, why don't we wait until, these are a little more scaled up. We can wait until 2030 or whatever and, and then adopt. How did you guys work through those set of considerations and come to the conclusion to say, all right, we want to lean in?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>22:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>From UPS's standpoint, this was a clear opportunity for us to take advantage of an invitation from the FAA to participate. And then as we did, we acknowledged that there were several benefits. One, we could set the safety bar. and we've done some of that as we've proceeded with our operations. We're the first carrier to have an FAA accepted, SMS program. So, that was a big step for us and we're working through our ASAP program as we speak. So working with the FAA to know that as these new technologies come to market, they're being done safely. And for us, it's protecting our 121 operation as well. We've got, one of the largest jet air fleets in the world. and when we think about those operations, we want to know that the new technologies coming aren't going to put those at risk. So we kind of wear two hats in that sense. So we've been able to participate in the rulemaking and establishing what safe and good operations look like from the beginning. So I think that's a big piece of it. And then the other significant item is, as we've looked at all the companies out there building these new solutions and creating new opportunities, we're able to inform those products. And we want to inform them from a cargo operator's perspective. the initial eVTOLs were all built around air taxi use cases. And for us, a lot of those cabins don't conform well for package. So for us, being able to, on the front end of solutions being developed to influence those OEMs, to create products that are meaningful to us, I would say is the other big element to the equation.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>23:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, it sounds like your desire is to take some of these advanced aircraft, electric aircraft, and replace some of the feeder routes with it. And, altogether, bypass some of the ground legs in the process. Have you explored the idea of just, changing the paradigm of how cargo is moved, in terms of breaking up a single load that a Caravan might fly into multiple drones and somehow redefine and reimagine the network themselves as opposed to taking a new technology and plugging it into an existing framework.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's a great thought and we have done that work. We've got an operations research team that has helped us develop modeling and simulation efforts and in that process what we're able to do is plug in aircraft specifications, capabilities and cost. And run models that compare the different solutions. So we have undertaken some of those efforts and in some cases, it will choose to replace a larger aircraft with multiple smaller craft and take more volume direct to a specific destination rather than consolidating in some cases. So, yes, I would say that is an opportunity and we continue to evaluate it. I would say. Entry into service, though, will look probably a lot more like plug and play on an existing route, until we get to some sense of scale, and then reimagining the network becomes a bigger opportunity at that point, once, once we're able to scale some of these technologies.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what are the driving factors that would influence that decision in your modeling and analysis?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We're a time definite service, so we have to know that the solutions are going to meet the time requirements, involved, and then I would say cost is going to be one of the most primary considerations. Anything that we do that's new has to show some return on investment, cost savings or new revenue generation. So I think that's where this is going to become extremely important as well. It's one thing to reduce our carbon footprint, for example, with a sustainable power plant, but if it does so at a higher cost, we've got to weigh that into the equation. So, we're looking at it from all angles, and cost will be a driver, safety will be a primary consideration, and then time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, let's say we, we go to your whiteboard. And on the left side of the whiteboard are the use cases, the business justification and the use cases for where UPS needs enhanced capabilities. On the right hand side are the, it sounds like 850 different companies that you've evaluated to fit those near term, perhaps long term use cases. How many of the 850 we're almost perfectly situated for the use cases you've identified.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>it's a pretty small number. I think that, again, the focus of some of the industry's been on things that aren't in our plans necessarily. So, again, getting people to think about cargo versus air taxi, that was a big issue for us to find solutions that work. What we are seeing and I think becomes extremely important, there are companies that are focused on cargo centric aircraft. And in my career, I've spent time in our aircraft acquisitions division of UPS multiple times. And that's where we evaluate what fits the network need for the air solution part of our network. And there's limited options there. Most of the conversations are with your Boeings and Airbuses of the world. And, they've got a product offering and you're typically, in the past, we've competed those two brands and found the solution that meets the need. But almost in all cases, and when you look at the history of the cargo market, we were getting aircraft that were originally designed for passengers. And for those companies, typically a new production line is based on passenger need first. And then cargo is an afterthought. In many cases, early days, it was all retrofitted aircraft, converted aircraft for freighters. They did start building production freighters with the introduction of some of our early fleet. The 757s was an example of, us entering the market with new, mission built freighters, if you will. But they were born out of a passenger aircraft. So when I look at solutions that come across our inbound. When someone is very keen to think about a product that's centered around the cargo mission, it gets really interesting because you get to take advantage of efficiencies that weren't planned in the original aircraft. You don't have to worry about passenger egress necessarily, or passenger comforts that, don't necessarily play a role in the, the cargo market. If I was to focus on one area, I'd say that's where the most significant gain for us will be is products that are really designed around our needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As you evaluated the 850 and you said there were very few that were cargo centric. Did you go to any of the, let's call them the, the non cargo OEMs, have you made recommendations to them on changes that they should be making, and have any of them changed their ways to adapt to your requirements?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In most cases, I would say the majority of the market has been very receptive to our feedback, and I think that's one of the value ads we bring to the industry. If you talk to people that have met with us, I think they'll tell you we've given them very direct, clear feedback about what's important to us. And it may not align with their core mission. So, and we're okay with that. people are designing aircraft for different reasons and different needs. The air taxis of the world, most of them were already far enough down a path that type certifying their first aircraft isn't going to pivot easily to cargo, version. So it's not that they haven't taken the feedback. But I would say that, there's limited opportunity to adjust aircraft that were already started down that pipeline, where I think there's a huge opportunity is the second generation of these new aircraft. I think people will think about them differently and, we'll see them scale up in size to meet more of a cargo configuration and even larger passenger, consideration. There was one thing I was going to bring up on this topic, though, when you think about the aircraft and what they're capable of, one of the challenges I think that the air taxis are going to see, and we've heard voiced already, is they've built them around the passenger load, but in many cases, they can't accommodate baggage. That's becoming a, I think, a consideration that the amount of baggage that someone will be able to take on an air taxi to get to that mainstream airport. may not align with what they would want to or can bring when they actually get on the jet. So I think that's one of the issues that market will have to address, as they move forward so that, the solution actually makes sense for the customer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Earlier, you mentioned, utilization of the feeder aircraft. Can you talk a little bit about what utilization you expect from this next generation of vehicles and how big of a risk is that in your overall business case?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So right now, our feeder aircraft network, as I mentioned, it's very tightly tied to our next day air network, and when those aircraft land at those regional gateways, that's when we use those feeder aircraft. They do a rotation out. And back. And that one rotation is going to be a challenge to pay for. So, that's where we start looking at how would we utilize these aircraft potentially different. And as the new technologies come in, these advanced air mobility aircraft, they'll start out crewed in most cases. we do know there's a couple OEMs out there that want to start with autonomy capable or remotely piloted aircraft. But in general, they'll start out crewed. But as we do transition to aircraft with capabilities of remote piloting, now you don't lock the asset, or landlock it, I should say, at an airport while the crew's in rest. And that's where I think it can get really interesting for the industry, because, when our CEO looks at things that our company does, one of the terms Carol will say, or phrases she'll use with us, is sweat the asset. And when you buy these, high price, new technology things, you want to be able to use them and make good use of them. So I think that's where we'll look for new use cases. And one of our core principle areas that we're focusing on here at UPS is healthcare. So if we move our normal rotation for the next day volume, and then we have this asset, can we onboard new healthcare revenue for other purposes, time definite goods, but that may not fit into our existing network today. There's also other opportunities. When we look at, especially eVTOLs, and you look at the coastal areas of the U. S. and island chains or geographically challenged areas, it creates new opportunities to connect those communities that otherwise are a much longer ground or even ferry included transit. So I think there's different ways that we can support other business and revenue cases with some of these technologies.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>J Jeff, did UPS ever consider the use of helicopters for any of these routes or operations in its network? And as you look at eVTOLs to fill this type of a role, is it their reduced operating cost that you anticipate is going to be the lever?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes. So UPS has looked at helicopters in the past. And the prime example I'll use is when our jets arrive in Newark, those aircraft land in today's world, we offload that volume into trucks, and those trucks contend with bridges, tunnels, and traffic to get into the city. In future state, what we would like to do is take an eVTOL from the jet aircraft arrival, and eventually go directly to the roof of the 43rd Street Hub in Manhattan and get that early am custom critical healthcare type volume directly there to the sort facility. We know that's not going to happen right away and there'll be step functions. In today's environment, we know that we're having to look at other solutions like barging some of the volume across to make time and that's not necessarily attractive when you're looking at those early am custom critical type deliveries that we need to get out early in the morning. So, that is a big opportunity for us with those eVTOLs to exercise that capability. That is one of the use cases that we've looked at helicopters for in the past, and the operating expense just doesn't justify. One of the step functions I think we'll see happen though is the Stockyards VertiPort for example. I think people will look to leverage those type sites to get to the city until we graduate further down the road to actually landing on structures again in Manhattan.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>35:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, many of the OEMs or startups that are producing these vehicles reason at this point in time that they want to be the operator. How does UPS think about working with companies that are at that stage? Can that be a fit, or is that not?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>35:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So for our Part 135 operations that I think all these advanced mobility solutions would fall into, we're open to both. We're open to partnering with people that are operators and OEMs. We're also interested in onboarding technologies to our certificate. So I think we can go either path. Our current feeder aircraft fleet is all vendored out. We've got a pool of vendors that have aircraft that we source from. And what we've done in the advanced air mobility space right now is we've tried to, in some ways, play matchmaker. We'll look at vendors that operate for us and new technologies and start to create interest there for onboarding some of the new technologies to their fleets. But we've got very little control over that. And so for us, I think we want to go down both paths. We want to encourage operators to look at new technologies while at the same time. us participate in bringing those to market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the healthcare market that you see yourselves going into, and how much of it was driven based on the capabilities of the vehicles that you're talking about?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So UPS is very focused on the healthcare market in general. We've got a whole division of the company that's very focused on healthcare solutions. And for us, we want to be another item on the menu for those healthcare customers where we can provide a service that may not be capable any other way. A lot of these products are time definite. We looked at solutions in the very beginning, that we actually do today in some ways. So, hospital campuses, for example, when you look at small UAS, we've got the opportunity to expedite service for those patients, whether it's their lab samples getting from a clinic to the main hospital lab and being processed in time, that the doctor can diagnose before they leave. I mean, that's a change. We also have done roles where medications are formulated and under hoods and very sterile environments in labs, and then they have to get from there to the clinic. And we've also expedited those movements of those specialty medications for patients using drones. So those are a couple examples of things that we actually do today. As you, you scale up from small UAS, we think there's going to be room for those medium size vehicles to come into play and help balance loads and networks for these health care providers. Stock rotation and expediting those is critically important. These are expensive goods and, as they start to reach maturity, and have to be cycled out, I think that's a way that we can help support some of these customers and providers by expediting those movements\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What is the reason that part 121 owns the jets and the part 135 operation being vendored out and how does that impact your thinking whether to outsource or bring in house some of these AAM vehicles.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we look at our 121 operations, those are very stable operations, meaning the locations we fly to, those don't come and go and ebb and flow that drastically. We see growth. But when we assign a jet to a route in a market, it's meeting a particular demand level and that we see, some pretty significant consistency there. Not that the network doesn't change over time. Our jet fleet is made up of different aircraft types that we can gauge up and down. But when we look at feeder aircraft markets, those are more likely to ebb and flow. During COVID, we saw a flex up. The demand was higher in some of these smaller markets for goods, to be flown, as we saw COVID wrap up, some of that demand subsided. So we can't adjust, as quickly if you own the assets and deploy them. With vendored operations, those are contract driven and we've got the flexibility to increase capacity very quickly or draw back if necessary. And with a pool of providers that, allows a lot of flexibility. So that's kind of why we've gone down that path. The future could look different. And as we look at the mature markets for feeder aircraft that have some consistency, those may be areas that we choose to operate ourselves, but we're open to exploring both paths. And I think it'll be a financial decision in the end, what's more attractive for us to pursue and what solution fits the needs. And you bring in remotely piloted operations, I think that will be a, a differentiator. if you own the asset and you're running a remote operation center that's just staffed, you have the opportunity to keep those assets moving, more of the day at a lower overhead cost than just, another contract for another route. So, I think as these scale up, there is an opportunity to look at the cost differently, with own versus vendored operations.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the common things that we hear when we're talking to entrepreneurs that are, pitching large logistics players like UPS on cargo drones of various sizes, is that, those logistics giants don't really want to engage until there is end to end readiness in the chain. Not quite interested in exploring a few routes here and there. The message appears to be, okay, well, sounds interesting, but come back when we can rely on this a hundred percent and when there's ways that we can plug it in seamlessly and integrate into the existing workflows.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so for these solutions to really make sense into our networks, they're going to have to be reliable. They're going to have to solve for the mission set that we see today. So reliability will come with, weather capabilities. These aircraft are going to have to be able to fly in the same conditions that traditional feeder aircraft fly in today to service our mission. Our customers won't be happy if there are certain days that we can't service their volume. Obviously, in today's world, there are limitations to existing aircraft, including our jet fleets, and that's kind of understood, but if you create new limitations based on a new aircraft entering service, I don't think that's going to go well. So we, we need these solutions that come mature to the market with the capability of operating in wind and, precip conditions that existing aircraft handle today. And when we think about integrating these new technologies into our network, I mentioned once already that, for us, there's a huge importance on what happens from touchdown to takeoff. It's that window of time that we need to have clear understanding of what's required to make the operation successful. If it's an electric aircraft, that's going to include charging infrastructure, regardless of what type of aircraft, you're going to have to know that plan for fueling it and keeping the aircraft moving. How we interact with the aircraft is another big question. If it's an autonomous, capable, or autonomy related aircraft that's remotely piloted, how does the ground crew know when to approach the aircraft? What functions are performed by the ground crew versus someone remote? And, you think about things as simple as, approaching the aircraft to chock it, opening the aircraft, and then once you've unloaded the aircraft, on the other end, who preflights it? How do you weight and balance the aircraft? How do you ensure that it's conformed with that weight and balance plan? There's a lot of considerations that I think as we want to integrate these new technologies into the network, we've got to be very thoughtful about what happens on the ground. I don't know if that kind of covers what you're looking for there, but that's a huge importance to us.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you come forward to certain OEMs and say, Hey, these are our requirements. Can you build something to these specs as opposed to, inversing the problem and evaluating hundreds of companies and concepts that don't necessarily start from your use case?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes, to some degree. We've not gone out to your typical, new entrant OEMs and posed those type questions, but the long term players in the market, we've shared those views with. So yes, we have on the front end talked about what product needs look like for us. And I guess, big picture, we do have established standards that, if we're wanting to tackle the feeder aircraft use case, for example, we do have standards that we will share with those that we meet with about what good looks like. So, it's not just about adapting their current product, but we'll tell them what we're looking for. So, in some cases, as I mentioned, it may not impact their current product offering that they're trying to type certify, but it helps them inform that future aircraft that they have on the drawing board.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, if you're going to scale operations with advanced air mobility vehicles by 2030, do you think you've already talked to the OEMs who are going to be part of that scaling process? Do you think you're already in conversations with those, or do you think a new OEM is going to be at scale by 2030?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's a pretty time consuming process. So I would say if they aren't already, in heavy development of their product, they're probably not gonna make that horizon.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So you've probably already talked to them. It's a OEM that you're already talking to, like a Beta.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Right. I would say that's the case. Yes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And if you had all 850 companies listening right now on the podcast, and you were going to give them a vision of where you see yourselves going and changes that you would like them to make, you've already given some of it. What else would you want to tell them to be able to meet the requirements of UPS so that you can scale by 2030, 2035? They're all listening now.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I would give the advice to not just listen to UPS, but listen to the operators in general to make sure that the products that are being built meet the needs of the cargo market. And for us, this will be more specific to UPS, when we look at our air network, we are typically volume limited and not payload limited. On our typical fleet, that's what we see come out. And that being said, a lot of the aircraft being built are very sleek and aerodynamic, which is great, but they don't conform to the large volumetric needs that we need. So I think as products come to market, that volume consideration is just as important as payload and range can be, because if you can't contain the volume, the solution may not be an option to even consider.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What else would you tell them?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Focusing on that reliability piece and knowing that what they're bringing to market can meet the same or better reliability standards that we have today, and that safety is also of paramount importance. We want to see this industry successful. And we don't want to see it hit hurdles unintendedly because, corners are cut or safety isn't a priority. So for us, that's one of the most important things. And there's the aircraft side of it, but there's also, some of the infrastructure pieces and whether it's the ground support needs for the fuel or whether it's UTM and the requirements to integrate into the airspace. I think those are all important. So, depending on the vendor type, we're expressing those interests, relevant to the solutions that are being created.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Jeff, I would imagine that some of the military logistics missions whose requirements are being scoped out and that are being developed for by companies might also serve the mission profile that you describe. Are you seeing a good fit there and do you see a path where the technology is going to mature in the military domain area and fit right into what you guys want to do with it?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We do see some parallels, and I'm excited about those. The challenge for us is that, the military variant aircraft won't have to hit the same type certification requirements that commercial aircraft will. So the paths do look different, but I think the work that's being done with the DoD is extremely important because we've seen a couple of things happen in the industry. We've seen VC money dry up and challenge that vendor pool. We've seen consolidation as a result, and a lot of the efforts going on with DoD projects are a way to fund the industry forward. And I think, of significant importance to them because they have ways to bring new capabilities to the battlefield and support missions differently, and in some cases without putting as many people in harm's way. And for us, I think that's proving grounds that will help create scalable solutions, for the commercial market. So I think there's great benefit there. It's still early. We're very familiar with our partner, Beta, on some of the work they've already done with the military, and I think it's, it will pay dividends, I think, not just for Beta, but others that are participating, because I think it will help fund the progress of their product, and, they're able to do real world use cases ahead of the commercial market. We can participate in proof of concept operations, but they're very limited. The military can put aircraft through their paces and in real world situation, more readily available. it doesn't require all the same.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, that's true. And they can operate them in very different ways than you have to operate in the National Airspace System. When you guys think about flying relatively large autonomous aircraft in the NAS, what are your assumptions around that operation? I mean, I assume it's going to be above 500 feet AGL and so it's going to be interacting with other air traffic. Is this going to be a remotely piloted operation or is it going to be some other level of autonomous flight? How are you guys mapping that out and what are your expectations for what that's going to look like in the coming years?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Sure. So the small UAS operations that we have, current day and expectations moving forward will still be limited to keep those below 400 feet. But when we look at the advanced air mobility solutions that meet our feeder aircraft needs, those do enter that traditionally, crewed aircraft space. We think that the solutions we will start to introduce in many cases, they're going to start crewed and be seamless to ATC as it stands today and other crews in the airspace. We've already see that play out with multiple vendors in proof of concept operations where ATC nor other pilots in the airspace really acknowledge or know the difference between that aircraft in operation versus anything else. And I think that's the goal is a seamless integration. I think there's great promise in what UTM solutions can bring to the table. And, potentially helping bridge the gap between current ATC and what the future could look like. The early state, the goal is to be irrelevant. I've heard, Jeffrey Vincent talk about it, and, he's leading that UAS effort with the FAA and boring is good. When they think about operations in the air, they don't want it to be unique and different. I think they're looking for solutions to fit the mold current day. And then. help evolve what the system in the future actually looks like as you digitize more of the information.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think we have a pretty clear path emerging for what autonomous flight below 400 feet is going to look like. From your perspective, what is the biggest aircraft that we're going to be able to fly down at those altitudes before it gets to the point where everybody says, okay, this has to be pushed up higher for a bunch of safety and operational reasons. What's the biggest aircraft that you expect is going to be flying at or below 400 feet AGL?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you would have asked me that, several years ago, I would have said 55 pounds. I mean, that, that was kind of the standard known and accepted. But as we've seen new aircraft come to market, including Amazon's solution, they're getting larger, right? And I think with those larger solutions, there will have to be determinations on what the use case is, and if they're final mile, they're going to be in that airspace, and, I think as the OEMs look at what's required, and I'll give a couple examples. For small UAS to be successful, you have to get that utilization high, and one of the ways that you can do that is making more than one delivery with an aircraft when it goes out, on a route. So to do that, what we've seen is you're probably going to have to go above 55 pounds. What that upper threshold limit is going to be, I'm not sure. We heard some of the early conversations this week at the FAA Symposium about Part 108, and I think that will help inform what this looks like moving forward. I'm also familiar with the ARC recommendations, a little while back that, I don't know if I'm recalling exactly, but I think it was around 1300 pounds was going to be a limit maybe for Part 108, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're operating in 400 foot and below altitude. So I think there's still a lot to, to play out in the regulatory process to know what that's going to look like. I do think from our perspective, I don't think we would want to use very large aircraft for final mile use cases. I know personally, if I had an aircraft arriving at my home, I think there's limits to what I would want to see above my home, and I think that'll start to inform some of it. Right now, a lot of the activity going on in Dallas, at the site city efforts for UTM, I think that's going to be very informative to the industry to see how those start to take shape. Several operators, same airspace, delivering a variety of products to a pretty broad array of customers. So I think we'll learn more as that plays out and the rulemaking processes as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>54:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, certainly it's a big question in my mind and the people that I've been speaking with in terms of, okay, where is that upper gross weight limit going to be placed for beyond visual line of sight flight, according to part 108, whether it's below 400 feet, which is one scenario or up higher. Agree with you that, a 500 pound aircraft going and doing a last mile delivery over someone's house, that's just going to be too loud. That's not going to be accepted. And there are probably few use cases where that would even be required. But for long range logistics missions that are between, other points, like a depot or something, then you could see a use case for a substantial aircraft making that journey. And it would be simplified, because we have the rules already emerging if you can fly it according to part 108, and especially if you can fly it at 400 feet or below, but I haven't seen a lot of clarity on what that's going to look like yet from the people in the community.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, just my personal opinion is I don't think we'll see those larger aircraft in that 400 foot and below altitude. I think that'll be, more so restricted to the final mile type path. Now, again, the 55 pound limit that we've talked about and that has existed, I think that threshold is going to be too limiting. So I do think it'll go north of that. We, as I mentioned, delivering one, more than one package on a trip. I think that's a capability that could be needed. And then you also start thinking about the onboard detect and avoid capabilities that you want to have on the aircraft, and all of that just competes for real estate. So, I could easily see, like I said, the solutions going north of that 55 pounds, but, that upper bound limit, yeah, I think as you approach that hundred pound mark, I think that's going to be a ceiling somewhere in that ballpark is just my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is your expectation that this will be spelled out in the anticipated Part 108 NPRM that we're waiting for?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I would hope so. I think the more that the regulation can inform the industry, it sets course that's actionable. And I think that's good for the operators and the OEMs to know, where they need to focus their effort.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, when we're talking about integrating remotely operated or autonomous aircraft into the national airspace system, can you talk about the technologies that you see playing a critical role in supporting that effort and where do you see the maturity of those technologies and what is the appetite on the UPS side to invest in some of this infrastructure?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think participating is our sweet spot. Trying to give feedback about what good looks like, I think is where we would want to play. As far as investing, you know, UPS played a big role in ADSB's rollout to the industry. And I think that's a good example of how we wanted to see new technologies evolve, but we understood for it to scale to the global market, we couldn't be the owner, at least it wouldn't necessarily be well received and, so for us, I think helping inform the product is the space that we would be in and then encouraging it's, growth and maturity. But I, at least from my point of view, participating in its, development, deployment view right now at Flight Forward, I would not say we're going to heavily invest in that infrastructure piece, especially when you're thinking about like integration to the NAS. The ground infrastructure, there's places that I think will be important for us to consider. If you're thinking about ground charging infrastructure stations at airports, uh, we'll want to leverage some of the network being built in FBOs, for example, that will have some of that infrastructure. But if we've got certain points in the network that are time critical, we may find that those are locations that we want to put our own, shovels in the ground and, have that capability there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Just recently the FAA approved certain drone operators to operate within the Mode C veil just based on ADSB In information below 400 feet AGL. What do you think the means of achieving, adequate detect and avoid capability outside of the Mode C veil will look like?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, we, believe it or not, when we first started Flight Forward, we tackled a project out in Utah, that was at a healthcare campus, and our proposal was ADS B as the primary source. We thought we were on a good path and ended up not, being approved for it at the time, so I think we were a little ahead of the game, in our request. But we've always thought that was a good approach to hit a good amount of the population, when you think about those Mode C veil areas, it covers the majority of the population in the United States. Not geography, but population. But to hit the areas outside of those locations, we've already gone down the path, and last November achieved BVLOS using ground based radar. And we're looking at various solutions that allow us that flexibility, and I think it'll be a combination of both. as the industry matures to hit the markets we need, but that's, for us right now, ground based radar is that next solution. And then, as we talked about just earlier, the size of the aircraft is going to dictate what you can have on board. And as the solutions get smaller and lighter weight, if you've got the ability to carry that detect and avoid onboard the aircraft, I think that gets very interesting as well. There's a lot of factors to weigh into that cost of an individual aircraft. Again, the penalties you take from a payload side, but, I think those three paths are clearly what's out there, and they'll all serve their own unique purpose, depending on the environment.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, if you were going to have a redo, let's say it's five years ago, and you're going to define your business cases, and you're going to look at the you anticipated 850 different interviews with different OEMs out there, what would you have done different?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think, we learned, it took a while to learn this, but we learned that there was what we call vaporware. There was a lot of people we met with that we spent a lot of time, and it, in a lot of cases, they weren't far enough along for us to spend a lot of time with. So I think I would have, you know, and I love the question because, looking in the rear view mirror, you can't change anything but you, you do kind of re-envision decisions and it, in some cases it can help you look forward and make sure that you're doing things that you would've changed in the past. So I think focusing our effort, on more known items, and then also I think earlier on, pushing a little bit more on the AAM solutions to meet needs. What we've, again, what we've found is a lot of the entrants were focused on air taxi. And I think they've, a lot of them have realized that cargo cargo will likely move first before people. And because of that, I think we could have shifted a little focus earlier on just my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And the use cases within UPS, if you had to do it over again, are there use cases you thought would develop within UPS that didn't develop and why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, so final mile, I think, was more challenging than most thought it would be. And we tackled one of the most difficult problems first. So some of our earliest testing involved integrating a drone in a package car. And what we quickly came to learn is that was one of the most complex use cases you could have because you've got a moving point A and point B continuously as the route continues. And at that point in time, a lot of the OEMs were presenting versions of small UAS integrated vehicles. And so I think that was a big learning curve, item for us and the industry. So again, I think it is the small package final mile effort. One of the things that we've learned is that the cost per delivery is a challenge in some cases for small UAS. Depending on the product that's being moved, what we're seeing right now, at least in industry state, to have a return on investment, it's going to have to be a higher value and bring with it a higher required, cost to serve. In the industry, we are seeing other providers deliver things like food and groceries. Some people are willing to pay that premium because they want that just in time service. I think healthcare falls into that category as well, where, there are niches in the market where people are willing to pay that premium. But when we look at how we deliver today, and the efficiency of our drivers, If they're in an urban area, higher population density, they're very effective. Our drivers are great at their job and they can service those high density areas very well. What we also find is as the drivers have to go off of main street USA, the further out they have to go, those rural and super rural, type deliveries, those cost us and them time. And those are the ones that we looked at picking off. But you've got to have enough of those to deliver from a location to make sense of standing up that UAS operation. So those are some things that, we've thought about that. I think there was belief that it would have more applications sooner, and there's been more challenges than expected in that area. And then you layer on top of it weather capability, that's been a challenge, too, that OEMs are starting to solve for, and we're seeing improved aircraft capabilities, but at least at the time of us initiating, there were more challenges than solutions, I would say.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And guys, we've heard some of this on the podcast as well. Some of the pushback and some of the areas where we thought there was traditional use case. Jeff we really appreciate this conversation. Is there anything that you were dying to talk about that we haven't talked about? Or do you just want to get off the podcast?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, it's been a great conversation. It's funny. I could talk all day about these topics. You can just ask my family, But no, these are near and dear topics to me. I think that there's a lot to come in the near term as we see rulemaking start to take shape. And I'm excited to see those things happen because again, for a company like UPS, we follow the rules. We just need the rulebook. and, it's kind of, it's been a tough place for us to really accelerate in when not all the rules exist yet. We've done a lot of things by exemption and, that process is painful and it's really not scalable. So I think as the rulemaking, comes to the market, I think that's going to really help accelerate things for us and others.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So a lot of people would say the UPS is kind of first through the wire when it comes to advanced air mobility use cases. Yeah, obviously, especially in the cargo side. But, if obviously you're one of the leaders, but who does Jeff Luckett listen to as it relates to advanced air mobility or in aviation general, who are the people you pay most attention to?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Wow, that's a great question. There, there are several great partners in the industry. We've clearly had a great partnership with our Beta team. And so, they've brought a lot of industry experts, to their company. and we hear and learn a lot through those partners like Beta. But I would say, last week, as a prime example, I had the opportunity to attend the FAA Symposium, and having key leaders from the FAA and industry, both from an OEM and operator perspective, all in one place that's the venues for me that are most important, where you can actually collaborate and discuss the problems and challenges that we have all in one environment. So I wouldn't say it's any one particular individual that I hang my hat on their opinions, but it's getting industry together and, collaborating in ways that we all help move things forward because, for me if the competition has a win, that's great that's not a problem for us. We want to see everyone succeed because, we really need that to happen for the industry to move forward. And, I don't know. I think that's for me, the collaborative effort getting the right industry players and regulators all together, I think, is a key piece.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, is there anything else you'd like to leave our listeners?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As a final thought, it's been very important for us to interact with the OEMs during development, and I just want to refocus on a couple things. First, safety. is critically important for us in the industry to be successful. I think that everyone also needs to focus on solutions that have a return on investment. If we can't prove the ROI, it's not going to be successful. And then the last piece is just to listen to the customers, not just the cargo customers. But, if a solution is being designed, those doing so should really listen to the people that they plan to sell to, because I think if they start earlier in the process in forming the product, the end result's gonna serve everyone's purpose better and be more successful.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, thanks for joining us.\u003C/p>","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","seoImage":"","seoKeyphrase":"","featured":false,"updatedAt":"2024-08-13T13:50:47.182Z","type":"PODCAST","entityType":"PodcastEpisodeDto","restricted":false},{"_id":"66732e404a0fa45045ce11ec","id":"66732e404a0fa45045ce11ec","title":"#69 David Stepanek, Bristow: A philosophical guide for early AAM operations","slug":"69-david-stepanek-bristow-a-philosophical-guide-for-early-aam-operations","pubDate":"2024-06-19T18:00:00.000Z","link":"","guid":"Buzzsprout-15278662","description":"\u003Cp>We are happy to welcome back David Stepanek, Executive Vice President and Chief Transformation Officer of Bristow.

This technology of distributed electric propulsion systems and advanced flight control systems is revolutionary. And we must apply the evolutionary learnings that we have had over the last 120 years. And by doing so, in the thesis I lay out, you're helping to ground that base and think about, okay, let's not just run down the hill. Let's walk and make sure that we can cover all the aspects that we need to cover. Our air transportation industry is the safest mode of transportation in the world. And yet we still have some certainly surprises that occur in aviation safety and in the design of the vehicles, in the control systems. We've all seen them in recent times. And here, these are processes and aircraft that have been around for quite some time. So I just want to make sure that we stay grounded in that we don't just accept the fact that we've got this new technology and it's going to just work immediately and be safe because it's new tech. We've got to go through the processes and procedures and time, of use to bring this to a scalable solution for transportation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Welcome to a much anticipated return of David Stepanek, Executive Vice President, Chief Transformation Officer of Bristow. Few can offer a more seasoned, measured, practiced, realistic view of where advanced air mobility has been, is, and perhaps where it's going. For those who have taken a careful, realistic approach to advanced air mobility, this discussion is a confirmation of your smart approach. We've been so eager to have guests back for a second conversation. Because the earlier impressions and assumptions mature over time. And in some cases they hold true and in others, they evolve. Hearing how things have changed can be of great value to our listeners, OEMs, operators, as well as investors. We're particularly fortunate that David and team have taken the time to write A Philosophical Guide For Early Operations. As they have put their thoughts on paper, on how advanced air mobility should be carefully and properly deployed. David and Bristow have been early adopters, buyers, and implementers of the advanced air mobility so their initial and subsequent assumptions and realized outcomes, carry great weight. As David mentioned often throughout the guide in our talk, he believes that those who have experience in vertical flight and being experienced operators, have a particular edge in evaluating, deploying, and scaling advanced air mobility. So listen to David's summary of the guide his five point thesis and general observations, his discussion of health management and flight operational data to enhance and optimize safety, and David's thoughts on what early advanced air mobility assumptions have proved out according to plan and what has changed from what some had thought just a few years ago. Given how precient David and team were just a few years ago, perhaps we'll listen even more and how he views the future of advanced air mobility as well as its risks and opportunities. Additionally, perhaps we even be a bit more critical and circumspect of those who have an interesting idea, but don't really know how, or don't have experience in bringing tech to the aviation market. Many thanks to David for his return visit and an important and engaging discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with David Stepanek as you innovate and generate positive financial returns in The Vertical Space. David Stepanek became Bristow's Executive Vice President Chief Transformation Officer in March, 2021. In this role David is leading the transformation of Bristow by introducing the next generation of advanced air mobility aircraft and expanding Bristow's core business in new regions. Through David's efforts Bristow has forged strategic relationships with multiple advanced air mobility manufacturers, leveraging Bristow's 75 years of safety management and vertical lift operations. He participates in a variety of public speaking engagements related to advanced air mobility operationalization and overcoming the hype of advanced air mobility to bring it to reality. David previously served as Bristow's Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer responsible for Bristow's global operations, supply chain, and IT. Prior to joining Bristow, David held positions with PHI, including President of PHI's energy business, and PHI Americas. David started new carrier businesses for a Phi in Australia, Cyprus, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad. He also led PHI's acquisition of Helicopters New Zealand in 2017. He has held board positions with Cougar Helicopters and HeliOffshore the global safety focus association for the offshore helicopter industry. David spent 20 years at Sikorsky aircraft in a variety of leadership positions. Including technical support customer service and commercial sales. During this time with Sikorsky David sold and delivered the first commercial S-92 model helicopter and booked over a billion in commercial helicopter sales.

Hey, David, welcome again to The Vertical Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My pleasure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, David. So we're going to ask the same question as we did the beginning of the last podcast, as we do all podcasts. What, is something that very few in the industry agree with you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A majority of the folks in this industry, the companies in this industry don't agree with me that really cargo is the way to move first. And that pragmatic approach to it. And that's driven by business models that have been, The activity levels that have to happen in order to infer some of the, returns that their investors are going to expect. So they're moving forward with, more of a urban mobility or transportation model, in and around the cities. Notably, what's potentially gonna be happening with, in the Middle East, in the United Arab Emirate with several of the different, OEMs that are vertically integrated. And then also the, the potential with, airline transfers in the New York region first. So, I want them to be successful. I do. I, I think they're going to be faced with certain challenges, but for Bristow and for, I think the vast majority of the theses that we've laid out is that cargo transportation will, in a business to business model, is the approach early to allow us to scale to, the different, unique business models of, of both regional mobility and urban mobility. As we, transfer, through the next, next five to 10 years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, how is that controversial?

And there's a couple of reasons that, you are the first person to return. One is to discuss your new guide, The Philosophical Guide for Early Advanced Air Mobility Operations. And number two, let's face it, there are not many people who have led the community like you have with, with partnering with an awful lot of very prestigious organizations who are, leading the way in advanced air mobility. So, to be able to hear your thoughts expressed in the guide, but also expressed in, what you've seen over the last couple of years and what's changed. That's probably one of the most important thing is what's changed. So if you could just give us a little bit of an overview of the guide, an executive summary, because everybody should read it, but give us an executive summary of the guide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll do my best. First, I think I should probably outline why I decided to write the guide. it's somewhat unique in doing so, and when I was talking to some of the executives within Bristow while I was doing this, First of all, they were like, what are you doing here? are we going to lean into some of our intellectual property? Are we going to tell people exactly what to do and generate more competition? My response is that our stated vision is to be a leader in innovative and sustainable vertical flight solutions. And, and being a leader really means rising other people up as well and, being part of the process. So our core competencies is one of the values that we believe that Bristow brings to the advanced mobility space. And without divulging some of the secret sauces that we use to, to manage our core competencies, I wanted to express the philosophies that we use and that we've learned over the 75 years of operating helicopters and airplanes to this industry and why. And so that was That was part of it. The other is I outlined some observations that I've made and those are concerns. So there's these observations that I've made that are outlined in the guide, and I wanted to express that and, and then offer some potential solutions or at least thoughts on, on solutions. And the third part is really intersected the, the other two to be the impetus to get me to write down this was, I work with an executive coach I have for a decade, and I was discussing with him the thoughts that what we're doing, the thoughts, some of the challenges that I'm, we're, we're facing, some of the frustrations that I have in trying to, to relay the messaging that I want to get across in a very short time period, generally that we have with, whether we're working with governments or business people or investors, you get 15 or 20 minutes. It's hard to get a very complex. thought process or complex philosophy across in that. And he said, well, you're basically writing the book on this. And then he went, that's what you should do. You should write the book. So, I laughed and said, I'm a busy man. I don't have time necessarily to, write something that needs, that's as complex as this, and that would be as in detailed. He encouraged me to use a ghostwriter and I thought about that a little bit further. One of the things that I like to do when I'm on holiday or go on very long, multi day, hikes. So last summer I was on a hike in Spain and I had a few days to really think about it. And I put the outline in my brain and jotted it down and decided to write it myself over the Christmas holidays. And so those were the three real factors there. And then I wanted to lean on people that I work with and people that I've talked to, people that I respect that have maybe a different, viewpoint of whether it's aircraft certification or government relations or the real technical aspects of the advanced mobility space. So I leaned on a lot of people, three I mentioned as contributing editors, and, and they, they had a, real big input to, what you, you finally got to read. Richard Lapin is an expert in government relations and international relations. And he's worked with various governments around the world. Marc Poland is an old colleague of mine. He retired from Sikorsky a number of years ago. He was one of the first, if not the first program manager on the S-92 and brought that aircraft through certification and launch of commercialization. And then, Dr. James Wang, the professor at a university in Singapore, he built the first tilt rotor, eVTOL aircraft, Project Zero in 2011, which he showed me back then. So I was able to really lean on them and bring some of their concepts and ideas and thought processes in. And I felt like once we had it written in a draft format, it was something that a lot of people could utilize. And I didn't write it for technical experts and I didn't write it for the, necessarily the people that are deeply involved in advanced mobility, but this ecosystem is going to be very large. There are going to be a lot of people that have never worked in air transportation or transportation in general. There are going to be a lot of investors that are going to be thinking about coming into this space. Because the total available market is substantial and it's going to spread across the globe. There's be a number of hundreds of different companies that are going to start up. So the thought is we've got this great philosophy about how to bring aircraft into service and the things you need to think about specifically in vertical aviation. And hence I jotted it all down and it's really 40 years of, my experience and others.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As you read the guide, you can hear a couple of themes that are loud and clear. One is there was a lot of exuberance early on, and there was a lot of promise early on. And that, in some ways, your guide is a de risking. guide, isn't it? Here's a way to de risk your investment. Here's a way to de risk if you're an OEM. So give us a couple of the areas that you think somebody reading the guide would perhaps think differently than where they are today. Whether they be the OEM or whether they be an operator. Whether they be experienced in vertical lift or not.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, one of the things I hope to get across in this was that once these aircraft are type certified by an airworthiness regulator. That that's not the end. We don't just, now we have an aircraft that's certified and produced. It goes to a dealership or it goes into the market. And we just turn them on. Like we do an automobile. To operate these aircraft for hire, for service, or to provide service to, the public or governments, you're an airline, so recognize that, and that stems from, I presented it to, Smart Cities Conference a couple of years ago. And these are mega cities, very, very smart people that driving city planning with tens of millions of people in population with lots of different, infrastructure and logistics issues to deal with. And one of the comments that they came up with was that, this is just like buying an electric scooter or an electric car, I'm just going to put it into service and when I explained to them what's necessary to do that, it's, you're an airline and you have to abide by the rules. By, by the rules and regulations that drive the, the air transportation system. So that's one. The other is that it's not easy. So being an air carrier is not just I buy the best stuff or the best aircraft and I put it into service and I hired it. There's so much more that goes into the thought processes of, not just which aircraft you buy, but how you configure it for its purpose. What are the process and procedures that you're going to utilize for the missions that you've outlined for your business plan? And how do you impart your culture of safety throughout the entire organization? So that's a very difficult process. It's relatively easy to buy an aircraft. Takes capital. A lot of people can raise capital. It's a little harder, right? Process and procedures, but you can hire some of that too. So you can hire some experts and you can get a lot of things just right off the shelf. The hard bit is having a culture that, it's a very top of the leadership, which I believe in, most, if not all cases, leaders of organizations want everybody in their organization to be safe. How you manage that and how you make that happen is a little bit more difficult than just wanting it. So you've got to be, you've got to have it in your DNA. You've got to have it in the way that you lead, the way you present yourself and the rest of the leadership team throughout the organization. Cause at the top people want to be safe, leadership wants to be safe, and at the line level, they're the ones that are executing, they're the ones that are going to cut their fingers, they're the ones that are going to trip and fall, they're the ones that are going to get hurt. They obviously want to be safe too. It's in the middle where you have this drive. So if you could see like an hourglass where you're driving people for execution, you're driving people for profitability, you're driving people to meet schedules, How do you make sure that they're imparting the philosophies and beliefs of that company? That's the hard bit. So it's not just I snap my fingers, I buy an aircraft, I get an air operating certificate and I'm ready to go. There's so much more to it, and I believe, and what I impart in this philosophical guide, is that companies like Bristow, not necessarily has to be Bristow, but companies that have this experience over the years and have done it over time, can put these aircraft into service in a very limited case and share the information of operational inefficiencies or data or technical problems with the industry to help improve the safety. At the same time, we're demonstrating to the regulator, safe, efficient operations that will allow the expansion of different, into different businesses. And hopefully at the same time, we're proving out to the public where there's been certainly some disarray, if you will, if you think about the, issues that, that Volocopter has been faced with in Paris and, really the citizens not wanting that to be operated during the Olympics or in the city at all. We can turn this into a more normal mode of transportation through that process. And that will allow investors and entrepreneurs to do either invest in companies or raise the capital necessary with the data that's been produced by these early operations to allow this expansion of the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the topic of all the steps that an air carrier needs to go through in order to introduce a new type to their operations. In your guide, you mentioned that that can take between, 12 to 18 months. everything inclusive of training, supply chain planning, writing of the operating manuals, maintenance planning, et cetera, et cetera. To what extent can this be parallelized? Talk a little bit more how that integrates with the discussions that you're having with OEMs. And to what extent is this really a serial operation as opposed to parallel?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll speak to it in two categories. One is if, we were buying a traditional aircraft that's already been type certified and in service, where that's very much a parallel operation. Say you decide to buy a new type of aircraft for your operation, they've produced it before. You're running the training organization. You're writing of the manuals. You have known performance to deal with. So you can write that in parallel with it. For an aircraft that's not yet been type certified, it's a little more challenging because there could be some constraints that appear before certification process. And there also could be some regulatory shifts or training shifts and how you're going to operate. So you try to run that in parallel as much as possible. One to align with the allocation of capital to buy the aircraft and two to speed up the, in service time, but it's, it, there's likely going to be a lag. So it's going to, run somewhat in parallel and somewhat in series, for the early adoption. And one of the things I mentioned in the document is, and this is from experience, early adopters with the wherewithal, with the financial capability to withstand and be resilient to certain aspects, the capital that's being employed, potentially with some alternative solutions in case there's a problem. We tend to have a little bit more patience with an OEM and a regulator when we're challenged with different problems, whether it's a technical problem, a regulatory problem, something that's cropped up in the operations. So you've got to be able to work within that whole process. And that can in part can actually slow training down. It could slow the aspect of staying current with that particular aircraft, if you have a gap in operations for a month or two. So all those things you'll have to deal within, the early operations side of things. So if you build a business model to just go out full throttle straight away, every aircraft flies every day, we're not going to have any issues. I mean, you're really setting yourself up for some disappointment and potential issues.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A good chunk of the document also covered your thoughts on early operations. Can we spend some time talking about how your current view on early operations has changed over the years and, how you see the evolution of these early markets?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So back to the pragmatic approach, that's why I want to do something in a constrained environment with business to business operation. Because one of the unique, aspects of these vehicles, specifically the 100 percent battery electric aircraft, that's certainly nothing that we have to deal with the traditionally powered aircraft is, will likely take off at maximum or close to maximum gross takeoff weight to get the most performance we can out of these vehicles. We're also going to land at maximum gross takeoff weight, whereas traditional aircraft will be landing at a lighter weight because you've burned off the fuel, all those things. So that means we're really putting the maximum stresses on the aircraft at both takeoff and landing. The business models and the range capabilities of these vehicles are going to require multiple takeoff and landings a day. And so we don't understand, surely, through the certification, there'll be analysis that's done and there'll be margins put on the structural integrity of it. But I do think that we'll likely see issues that will hopefully be rectifiable, that we'll have to deal with on the structural side of things. I relay back to experience with traditional helicopters. As I reflected, I couldn't think of one aircraft that we put in the service early that did not have some sort of, a structural issue that we had to deal with, whether it's sponsons and landing gears, or the frames around the primary drive system, engine mounts. You tend to have, higher use cases and higher vibration message in operations than you would in flight test. And you might not see them in flight test, you may not have predicted that these things could happen, but, but they tend to happen in these different environments. So having that temperate environment with, average temperatures, moderate humidity, not a lot of rain and thunder and lightning. Those early operations will allow for that testing and as, as we put them in harsher environments, we're going to see other issues that are going to crop up with these machines and how we deal with them and how we have the resilience and wherewithal to deal with them and ensure that we have a business model that can withstand, the financial challenges that are going to be faced with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. One of the things that stood out, part of your theses is that early operations should be over low population, low density, airspace type of geographies. And just to make the conversation a little bit more interesting and spicy here, I'm going to poke some holes, but, intuitively, intuitively, this makes sense. But at the same time, the regulator will not allow a new type to fly unless they are convinced that the aircraft is safe to be integrated into the national airspace system and safe to be flown over, whatever geography it is, approved to fly over. And so, to make an analogy when, when Boeing or Airbus introduce a new airplane, they don't have a restriction as to what airports they can be flown in and out of. Now, granted, those are systems that are well understood and we have decades of operational data to understand them. But at the same time, it just feels like this, constraint of early operations might impose some, economic penalties early in the use cases where those are needed the most.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had a sense that this was going to raise some controversy. And the hypothesis is really around several different ideas, and it's not just about the concern over safety of that operation, the concern that you may have to land the aircraft in a, unplanned environment. That is part of it, but it's not all of it. The other part of our business model thesis is, that these vehicles early on should provide services and goods to services to areas that are in need of it, that have, poor road systems, poor transportation systems that need to have materials brought to them in a more efficient manner. So when I think about those environments, I'll give you a couple of examples. Scandinavia has geographical barriers, so you have a lot of fjords. You have great road systems, but they take lots of time to get to. You have some transportation on rail, but not a vast majority like you have in most of Central and Western Europe. And then there's places such as the northern territories of, Australia, there's places within continental United States that fit that as, as well, and, others. And, those also tend to be, and it may not seem intuitive, but the coastal areas of Scandinavia is somewhat temperate. We have very few icing days. It's close to our supply chain. So that was one of the reasons behind it is, is that we think that there's a really good economic business model for that particular mission, and it serves the purpose of isolating the system in case there is an issue, we can deal with it. So it wasn't just about trying to put a constraint around use case of these of these machines. It was really our philosophy that we had stated very early that we think is the is the right business case for it, whether it's the islands of Scotland or fjords of Norway or, pick another country that has similar characteristics. I think Japan's another really good example, even though you've got a great rail system, you've got a condensed population with very mountainous region with lots of, rugged coastline that, that needs to be supported.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you mind sharing maybe some details when you looked at some of these use cases, in terms of the size of this market opportunity, how that compares to the initial expectation of these aircraft being used for the commuter market, what's their relative size and, can OEMs really scale, as expected in those early use cases?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the latter part of your point is I think important to note because the scaling is, I believe it's not going to be at the peak levels that, we're talking about early. So the production levels I believe they're not going to hit some of the early projections. It's going to be in the 25 to 100 to 150 aircraft per year until you scale new production and you have to distribute the production facilities globally, if you, plan to, penetrate those markets. So we've done, I gotta be careful what I say here. there's, there's a lot of work that's being done. A lot of it's being done under a non disclosure agreement. but what we're looking at for, for these different regions in Scandinavia is potentially up to 50 aircraft. in service over a two year period that can generate, you can do the same math that, that some of the SPACs have been, have done it on. There's potential two to two to three million revenue per aircraft in that space. Not all of them will work every day. It is a nice market. It is a market that potentially could provide very good returns to the operator and the other people that are in investors in that process and will provide, the necessary data for the scaling, both in production and implementation into different mobility factors, whether it's regional passenger carrying and, or, into the urban side of things. The other part of that aspect with this. early adoption of cargo transportation is you're utilizing existing infrastructure. So there's not, necessarily a requirement to go out and invest heavily in concrete. Or heavily in ground facilities. There will be investments that will be necessary in, the charging networks that'll have to be put in place. There'll be some other investments in there as well with ground handling equipment and tooling. But not to the scale of having to build a 25 or 30 million VertiPort and going through the whole process of the real estate investments that are necessary for it early on. If it works, if these aircraft are viable, safe, efficient, and reliable, that will provide the data for the investment thesis that are going to be necessary for the substantial amount of capital that's going to have to flow into the, investment of infrastructure, real estate development, air traffic management, communication systems, all the things that are necessary. And then the other reason for the remoteness side of it is many of the the big airports in the big cities, they're very close or at capacity. So you'll hear things from certain city planners or airport planners. It's like, Oh, great. We'd love to have UAM in here, but just don't add any more airplanes to my system. I can't handle it. Whereas in these remote locations, you've got airports that are screaming for help. That are, that want this, to come in so they can actually build out a process which should potentially create, create new\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>jobs. So, Dave, if we take this Scandinavian network as an example, what would you see the utilization of those 50 aircraft in that network being and how would it compare to what has been circulated in the community as to the urban air mobility or the airport transfer use case? How do those compare to each other and what are the pros and cons in your mind?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some of the work that is cargo movements are in belly cargo today. So they're somewhat constrained by whatever the capacity of the aircraft is, depending on how many passengers they're utilizing, and what the payload available is. And then of course the commercial schedule. And then the other aspect is you're replacing lorries and trucks, depending on which part of the world you're in. As far as, utilization goes so analysis is done. It's at this point in time, it's a guess, what are we going to get for reliability? What's the backup requirements? What's the maintenance schedule? We don't, know those information yet, if you look at it, a helicopter operation, the maximum utilization we tend to get on a per tail number or per serial number aircraft is about 90 percent. So you say you take a 12 hour day. 90 percent of the time, we can get a helicopter going. To get to a higher utilization, you have to employ more capital and have additional assets in place for backups. In the helicopter world, it's a much more intense amount of capital than you see in fixed wing aircraft. So you know, it's not, I think it's a, it's not unusual for a company, ultra, low cost carrier with hundreds of aircraft that maybe have three or four backups. I don't know what the big carriers carry. So to get to that rate will take more capital. And that's what we'll be planning in a certain number of technical backups to support maintenance operations and downtime for technical capabilities. And what we've learned in the helicopter operation is that with the proper amount of, technical backup, we can get up to 99 percent utilization rate. And then if that's measuring dispatch utilization, and then now you got to talk about what's the utilization of the payload capabilities, of the, of the asset,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the number of flights\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>and the number of, number of, number of flights, then, and really that's going to be relative to the performance of the aircraft, the hazards which you need to mitigate. We're again, just building early schedules out, but we're, we're thinking about six hours of operation on a daily basis is, about the right way to start somewhere between six and eight hours. So you're taking into account whether you have to have additional crew, fatigue, risk management, the, turnaround time, what you have to download, if there's information to be downloaded, the charging side of things, there's six to eight hours of, of daily utilization should, should suffice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the absence of operational data, where do you find the basis to ground your assumptions as to the level of interest and how you prioritize these early use cases?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you want to go somewhat of a, the art of war, go where your enemy's not, or go where it's easy to penetrate, the market. So there are certain just jurisdictions in the world that are willing to, work with what they might call a sandbox operation to prove some of these theses out. So potentially taking aircraft, even in a pre certification role, in a limited case of scope, and doing actual commercial operations for it, so proving out that process. getting potentially some, PSO routes. And some other things, that could help support the, the economics of it. And then there's the sustainability aspect and then the potentially the economic aspect. And I think, sorry, go back to one of your first questions about what, other people don't agree, agree on is that, I, a lot of people are pushing the sustainability side and it's very important but the economic model and the cost structure of this has to work first. Otherwise, it's just, it's going to be a difficult process. So that's the grounding of it. So we're, I, I've spent a lot of time and my colleagues have spent a lot of time working with, within different networks, in government, working at different airport authorities, and different logistics companies and energy and industrial companies that are, are really keen to, to give this a try and, and see if it works. And that's why, again, back to the, earlier show, invest as little capital as possible, do it with an operation that has existing infrastructure to prove it out so we can scale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you feel that you've properly expressed your five point thesis? We've nibbled at it, but if you could just rattle off the five.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So my five theses are that early stage AAM operations should focus on a business to business model, a commercial model, that support a logistics network that's potentially already in place, and that you do that within a 20 to 60 kilometer range. That's the first part. Second thesis is that advanced mobility commercial operations will be required to be conducted by a licensed air carrier. So you're effectively an airline and particularly in the early stages our thesis is that, that airline should have some experience in vertical lift and in safety management to be the most efficient to doing so. Third thesis is that early stage AAM operations are best conducted by companies experienced in purchasing and configuring aircraft for their intended uses. AAM manufacturers would be best advised to work with these companies to ensure that the, the product that they're developing is commercially viable and, and we'll be able to be used by the use cases. And, and, and, and the genesis of that thesis is that there'll be equipment and use cases that are necessary that don't necessarily be, need to be part of a type certification. So aircraft that are type certified don't necessarily have to have an enhanced ground proximity warning system or a TCAS. But they're certainly needed for fit for purpose for certain operations. And then fourth thesis is early AAM operations should be conducted by air carriers using existing infrastructure with a willingness to collaborate with potentially new companies in order to share data that is not necessarily commercial but operational and safety to allow the AAM business to scale on a global basis. And that fifth thesis is that air carriers involved in AAM operations should have the appropriate equipment. processes, programs, and people in place to manage both the health and flight data that we're going to derive from these vehicles. And that in part will also allow a shorter timescale to do some of these early testings that I philosophize around learning that process of having more data than we ever had on any other aircraft will allow us to crunch that data, aggregate it, and understand the health of the vehicle in a much faster pace. So I think that by utilizing that data, you could accelerate into different and newer commercial models that, will potentially substantiate some of the financial theses that have been put forth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dave, so you lay out the rationale for these theses in the document, but if you were to sum it up for the audience, what is the theme running in the background through your thinking that led you to create these theses? I mean, it strikes me as an approach that is grounded in a more realistic, and experienced view of what operations are actually like, and brings that into the conversation. But, in your words, what are the underlying themes behind your conclusions that you create in these points?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, I want to say that, I'm absolutely optimistic about advanced air mobility and all the potential use cases of it. And I believe that optimism is a force multiplier. So I want to get that out, Chris, because there is certainly a grounding. And some people could see this as pessimistic, or some people could say this as, I have a poor view of some of the early operations that may occur outside of my thesis. So I'm very optimistic about it. But behind it is something that I talk about early on is we're at a revolutionary point in aerospace. This technology of distributed electric propulsion systems and advanced flight control systems is revolutionary. And we must apply the evolutionary learnings that we have had over the last 120 years. And by doing so, in the thesis I lay out, you're helping to ground that base and think about, okay, let's not just run down the hill. Let's walk and make sure that we can cover all the aspects that we need to cover. Our air transportation industry is the safest mode of transportation in the world. And yet we still have some certainly surprises that occur in, aviation safety and in the design of the vehicles, in the control systems. We've all seen them in recent times. And here, these are processes and aircraft that have been around for quite some time. So I just want to make sure that we stay grounded in that we don't just accept the fact that we've got this new technology and it's going to just work immediately and be safe because it's new tech. We've got to go through the processes and procedures and time, of use to bring this to a scalable solution for transportation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, in some ways, you're very blatant about it in your guide, but what you're basically saying is bringing technology to aviation is hard.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's super\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And for those of you who, I'm putting a little bit of a shameless plug in for our companies, because this is one of the things we understand, and this is how we help our customers. But it's hard. And for those of you who have not worked in bringing technology to market in aviation, there are so many hurdles that you can't anticipate. And just because you certified your plane, you have so many other things to consider. We all read what we want to read, right? But that really popped out from your guide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, thanks. I mean, that's, that's, that's really the, the gist of it. I, it is hard. What every one of these, entrepreneurs and designers and the OEMs are doing is super hard. Getting an aircraft to type certification is super hard, super expensive. And now you've got an aircraft type certified that you've been thinking about for five or six years and working on getting it designed. And then technology's advancing beyond your certification base. So you've got to work on catching that back up and this loop there. And then now you've got type certified. Now you've got to build it. You've got to build it in a manner that's reflective of the type certification in a repeatable way, in a high quality way which takes another couple hundred million dollars to build out a facility to get to the production levels that are going to be necessary for this to scale. And I think it's brilliant that many of these companies are leaning on automotive because I do think that that's what this is going to look like long term production. But building aircraft on automotive model, it's a different way of, of things. And I was sharing a story today with one of the OEMs, about an aircraft that's been in our, this aircraft, this is public information. We had an accident of a, of an aircraft two years ago, about a year and a half ago, actually. And, and what it was, was it was an installation defect that happened 11 years ago. The aircraft's been in service for 11 years and the defect finally materialized. And if not for the great coordination of our aircrew, it would have been a very catastrophic event. But the team was able to analyze what had occurred and manage the process and land the aircraft safely, albeit with a little bit of damage. So these are just, it's really hard stuff. And getting to repeat on a large scale of aircraft production, a helicopter manufacturer today on a very good year is doing maybe 50 to 60 aircraft a year. we're talking about that in a month now, or even more at scale. So how do you ensure that repetitiveness? How do you ensure that quality system throughout the hundreds of people that are going to, or, or even the people that be programming the robots to install it, all that's going to be a big challenge. So now you got to produce, and then you got to get it, get an airworthiness certificate on and get it to an operator or operate it yourself. Which also lends itself to a very difficult process. One, to convince yourself safe, efficient, reliable, convince your local regulator so you can get it on your operation specifications and ensure you have the aircraft fit for purpose to meet the mission and the environment that you want to run your commercial program on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay so based on these observations, what do you think about the aircraft OEMs that want to have that vertically integrated business model and also be the operator? What are the pros, cons, or implications of your observations on that path forward for a company?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's going to take a lot of capital. My first view, it's going to take a tremendous amount of capital, more capital than they would have if they were going to be a traditional OEM. And it's another step that's harder. So if you're a traditional OEM, you're part of two processes, potentially two processes, type certification, support of that type certificate and production. And now you're adding back in the third portion of, of the difficult processes of operating it and the complexities and the core competencies to operate and build are very, very different. I understand why some of the companies want to do it, specifically in the United States, and I believe that their business model makes sense to them, and I think they're going to be successful early on, and I want them to be successful early on. I've had discussions with both of them that are in a more vertical mode. Their success is going to hinge on a lot of the future successes of this industry because they'll be some of the early adopters. I do think it's a challenge to the business model and that they may have to, shift some of their thinking. And I think you're seeing some of that with each of them doing more international sales and partnering with a variety of different organizations. But in the other cases, you're somewhat of an homogenous society, if you think about it in that way, where you're the entire ecosystem and you have control of that, but you're also the entire ecosystem when something goes wrong your complete economic model shuts down no matter where you are in that process. So if you have a technical problem that you have to deal with over a certain period of times, both your production is in disarray or could be, in jeopardy and you're not flying, so you're not collecting any revenue at all. And there's no alternative for you because you don't have different, sources of, transportation. Whereas traditional operators such as ours, one of the reasons we have a variety of different partnerships with the OEMs is, it's our experience that we will have technical problems and we will need to use alternative aircraft that may not be the most fit for one when there's other problems with those vehicles. So, there's certainly that risk associated with it. That's what I see, but I, again, I do think that they've raised enough capital and that they can get through this process and get the aircraft into their operation. And I understand their process of doing so. And there's an argument that controlling the whole ecosystem under one management team could be safer and you're controlling your brand in a better way. So I understand that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And also vertically integrating at this stage of the life of this new market gives you the opportunity to learn faster and absorb the lessons learned from operations into your next generation of aircraft\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>precisely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>iterations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah.

I'm sure that somebody reading the guide might say, look, this really sounds like an incumbent that is trying to protect their position when faced with a wave of new entrants, right? Because, throughout the document, there are hints at how only current established air carriers have the, experience and the wherewithal and the competencies to pull this off and introduce these new aircraft. And so one thing that stood out as I was reading it is your comment that no matter how dedicated to the concept of mission, a company cannot set policies and fully understand and manage the risk and assurance of running air operations. This is a quote, without the experience that comes from being an air carrier. So what does that say about the landscape of emerging air carriers? Are you making a statement that all the future air carriers for these vehicles already exist today? Is it reasonable entrants? How's that going to play out?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely reasonable and expected and required because we can't all operate. across the globe. So you're a regional air carrier. Bristow itself is a global regional air carrier. We operate in 17 countries, 17 is all right. There's a lot more countries in the world than 17 where they'll have all their own regulations. They're going to need their own startup companies. They're going to need their own processes and procedures to do this. My thesis is that they can learn from us and we are willing to share that information. and collaborate to allow this to scale globally. The thesis is we think that it's best to start with us and this information can be discriminated quickly because we'll have so much data from the health of the aircraft and the flight data, and potentially some of the business constraints that we'll have to deal with, to allow that, that scaling, on a global basis. So that's why I say in one of the theses they must be willing to collaborate. So this is really a thing. We want to be a leader. We want to be a leader because we want a great business. We also want to be a leader because we think this is necessary for the sustainability of transportation, it's necessary for this new revolution of, of aerospace and technologies that are being applied. We think that we start with these eVTOLs, we start with these eSTOLs, and that the propulsion systems and the power systems and, the energy sources are going to get us to a point where this is a much broader transportation network. We can put it on a larger equipment, potentially even, transatlantic flights someday or transpacific intercontinental flight someday. So the, it starts here and companies like ours with that experience can help get that started. That's, that's the thesis behind it. And there's plenty of really great people out there that have that experience that can move around the companies or could come in and help with that technology for those startups as well. That it's not just that you have to be the company, but that team that you put together will need that experience or the lessons learned and we think that's one of our duties to this industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, as people have reviewed the guide for you before you published it, what's been some of the tougher questions they've asked you, or the challenges you've heard on the guide that you'd want to share with the audience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we spent two weeks deciding whether a takeoff was a noun or an adjective with a preposition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you can imagine who that was with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Alright.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, some of the review is exactly what some of the points that you've put out, specifically Luka that are you just trying to ring fence this business? I mean, this is going to be so large. The total market If successful early is massive. And there's no way that we would even want to ring fence that. So we, we think we can create our business on our attributes and that we think that we should help things. So there was that concern of the ring fencing. There was a tremendous amount of debate about, I did use some stronger languages in some of the early drafts about should or must. Or shall and must. so that, some of that, that came out. we got a little bit more detailed in the types of advanced air mobility aircraft, laying that out. I was a little concerned about being too technical. And then there's been a really great reception of the portions on safety management and data collection and how it's aggregated. I had a fireside chat at the Revolution Aero conference today. There was quite a few questions about what the data should look like. Who owns it? How does it work? How would you manage it? And I, my words were if an OEM or a major supplier that's managing the aircraft data doesn't want to share that information and aggregate it and work with the operators to ensure that we set appropriate thresholds, that we have algorithms to detect anomalies that we learn and that we have actions that come out of these measurements, that I'm, we're not really interested in, in working with those organizations. So back to collaboration. I think we, we all have to collaborate to get this started and get it going.

So we've been operating helicopters for 70 years, 60, 70 years. And we finally got around to putting a proper organization together to manage that. And speaking with the gentleman who runs Heli Offshore, and I was a former board member of Heli Offshore, if we had a chance to start at the very beginning, just imagine what we could have accomplished. So here's an opportunity. We have a clean sheet of paper. We have a very good template. And even, recently the Royal Aeronautical Society published a paper of kind of three issues that could potentially happen. They outlined pseudo accidents and what could occur, and they even mentioned the fact that having an organization such as Heli Offshore will help, mitigate, potential issues and accidents. That we have that information. Somebody has an information that needs to be shared because we're going to see different problems across the globe you'll have, and you may even see similar problems. For instance, somebody's an inspector's out there looking at an aircraft. They notice there's something wrong with the propeller. And it's delaminated, and it's delaminated in this section.

And what you find in these organizations is let's say you have an organization of a hundred people in it, 20 of them are doing all the work. 80 of them are resting on the other 20%. so a lot of the information that flows comes from a smaller group. And then there's also somewhat of a fear of sharing information that may harm you commercially. You have to get past that. You have to, you can do it with proper contracts and agreements. But everybody needs to operate in this case, in good faith and safety is an industry wide, concern and an industry wide, it should be, should be focused on as an industry, not just as an individual\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And those are some of the same hurdles we heard 20, 25 years ago with sharing safety data.

How will the FOQA like data be any different than how commercial organizations, 121s and the others, are using it today? Or do you see it identical to, for example, what GE is doing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I mean, the technical component of FOQA identical, the impact, I think, will be greater in this environment. One, the numbers of aircraft will be substantially more. These are aircraft that are primarily going to be flown VFR, in low altitude space, so it's going to be having that assurance that the aircraft are being operated as the operation specifications and the company wants it to be operated in. I think it's going to have a greater impact on the industry. And then also it's interesting. You think about health and usage systems as a way to mitigate certain cost structures and improve the product reliability. but FOQA also comes into play here where you may see, even though it's, it's within the specifications of the aircraft or maybe within the operation specifications, you may see some use cases where you're wearing out wheels and brakes, and one base may be wearing out wheels and brakes at a higher pace than another. And when you look at FOQA, you can determine what's happening and potentially, mitigate that. So there's some, there's some really interesting, and this is an experience that I've had is there's some interesting economic benefits beyond just the assurance that the aircraft is being operated in a safe manner. And it's going to be also very important to play back into the training organization. And with the technologies we have today to replay in simulators and to replay in three dimensional models, it's going to help the new line pilots and the new engineers coming into play to learn some of the, lessons learned and see actual flights that have transpired, but it's also vital that FOQA is non punitive, unless there was a willful misconduct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, sure. David, given your guide, given you learned over the last couple of years, what would you have done differently at Bristow? And what organizations, perhaps, would you have said, Eh, maybe I wouldn't have done something with this vehicle, this vehicle type, then based on what you've learned.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, one, coming in a little earlier than we did, would have helped. We are, I think, an early adopter, but on the scale of things, a lot was happening pre the merger of Bristow, so we really couldn't have done it. But there was quite a bit of work that had been done with the legacy, the pre merger era team. Mostly data collection and some discussion. So getting in earlier, maybe applying more human resources to it. We wanted to be very careful in, nascent business. We still, especially in 2021, weren't sure what's this was going to look like. It was a tremendous amount of capital flowing in. So I think applying a little bit more resource to it, I think would have, would have perhaps accelerated our processes. On the latter part of your question, I'm very pleased with all the companies that we've dealt with. It's difficult right now to say, because there's, there's really some other interesting products that are being developed and some interesting entrepreneurs that I just have to say to them, it's not you, it's me. We are at our capacity of our team. We're a very small team by design which allowed us to be somewhat flexible. So, having a little more resources could potentially have allowed us into different markets. The other aspect, and this was a question from the first discussion we had, because there was a lot of discussion about the drone market. Maybe entering or thinking about that a little bit more on a scaled basis. I still believe that for us to start a commercial drone business on our own is going to be difficult because of the nature of our cost structure and in the size of our business and the flexibility that small startups will have, they'll have the advantage there in the cost structure, but you know, working in a better way with, with some of the leaders in drones and cargo delivery on the drone side, I think would have been something that, but we're, we're somewhat into it now. There's been a partnership made with one of the, one of the big players that I'm really proud of. We're going to be doing some work with them, proving out certain operations and potentially doing concept of operations for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm glad you raised this because I was going to ask you how an organization like Bristow might think about using UAS of various payload capacities from a couple of hundred pounds to maybe a couple of tons even, to execute on the mission like you described in Scandinavia or Northern Australia, and thinking a little bit differently about, the movement of cargo in general, that's optimized, with these kinds of vehicles in mind that are cheaper to operate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Well, we certainly are thinking about that and that's in our portfolio with, Elroy Air Chaparral, you have a vehicle hybrid electric system, automatic loading and loading of the payload, the pod, capabilities of putting different payloads into the pod, including surveillance equipment and things that are necessary for coastal surveillance or whatever you happen to be doing and doing those operations, as you mentioned, in, in places like Australia, Alaska, Norway. There's a, an energy company in Norway that's been testing out some operations beyond visual line of sight long distance. They want a 200 kilo payload to support their energy, business to hot shot parts out. They've done the economic model. They understand what being able to get those parts in a fashion they can with a drone versus a helicopter or a boat, which is most cases they use, and they can increase the uptown of their rigs materially. We're talking millions of dollars a month of change of production earnings or, cost shutdown issues that they deal with. But that's actually absolutely our business thesis of using those size drones. For that, when I talked about, I was talking about the little one, little, littler ones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are those conversations like internally? What are the considerations when you think about adopting something that is a bit of a departure from your core competence? As you enter that gray zone, what are you comfortable, what do you fear the most? Shine some light, to our audience about those boardroom level discussions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So some are at the boardroom and some are really at the operational level. So as I mentioned earlier, we do operate, drones for His Majesty's Coast Guard, but that is a government organization. It's not a type certified aircraft. It's not a commercial license to do it because we can do it for public service. Operating a piloted aircraft, we do that, we understand it, we know how to do it, we've got licenses to do it. Going into a remotely piloted aircraft beyond visual line of sight, which we have core competencies in that business, but translating that into a commercial side is something that's not necessarily one of our core competencies. So what the fear is, what would it cost? What would it, how long would it take? Should we partner with, another organization that has some of those core competencies already and we could help some of the weaknesses that they may have, market access, working with energy companies, sort of things. Hence an early kind of discussion with one of them that's doing that. So that's a way to mitigate it. We're still going to be measuring whether we should do it ourselves, whether we need a separate, whatever jurisdiction we have in, do you have a separate operating certificate for that? Or do you put it onto your current commercial operating certificate? What are the risks associated? If you have a problem in the advanced air mobility side, how would it affect the traditional helicopter model? If you're on the same certificate, do we separate that? That's all the work that we're doing today, in terms of our roadmap to operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you look at that remotely piloted operation that you would be flying, how does it differ from the way the Department of Defense might be flying the same platform? I mean, you mentioned Elroy Air. Obviously, they're bringing forward a platform, for both markets, but when you really get close to it, are there some major differences that sort of rise to the level of gotchas for those companies? Or are you really laying out a path that is a consistent and scalable dual use path? Because obviously DoD right now is one of the most aggressive customers for this capability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so my answer is going to be somewhat speculative because I'm not in depth on what DOD and Elroy are working on, other than I know they're in the AFWERX process. But I will say that operating an aircraft to an oil rig or to a platform, and working for an energy company, comes with a lot more responsibility, a lot more requirements that they would put on that I believe that the military wouldn't necessarily apply in the general operation processes. The requirements for mitigating liability, limitations of the liability, insurance processes, consequential damages. If you bang up an oil platform, that's producing 10, 000 barrels of oil a day. Do the math. That's a pretty heavy liability. So it comes with a tremendous amount more oversight and potential responsibilities for the,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>operator.

ADS B out has helped us get more in, and we do quite a few more IFR flights where we're controlled. That's within the United States. So we actually have to control and set up communication networks offshore, to ensure we have, communication navigation systems. We also use satellite downlinks and uploads to know position of the aircraft on a repetitive basis. It repeats about every 10 to 15 seconds and then they'll have some push to talk capabilities there. So it's a bit of a mixed bag depending on the flight and the location and, and whether they're flying in IFR conditions or not.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I wanted to get your thoughts on how our audience should be thinking about the market size of the mission set that you are putting forward in this document as the lowest risk path for scaling up. I believe that it's big. There are billions of people living in remote areas that need things. And there are lots of different applications, but it's not as conceptually obvious to the broader audience in terms of the scale of that as compared to the story around UAM and the things that this industry has raised a lot of capital on over the last few years.

So what markets are we in today and what is the size of that prize and what is our right to win it? So on a total available market, and I'm going to go to this analysis that was done by a very reputable firm, by 2035. we think on the cargo market size of, of it is approximately 60, 000 aircraft, potentially, total market globally, cargo, same basic numbers for both urban and regional mobility side of it. So, you're thinking about a potential market size of 120, 000 aircraft. 2035 and beyond, maybe that's getting pushed down a little bit further. For Bristow, and, and back to the theses here, because that was the basis, some of those theses were the basis of the work that we did to narrow that market down to, potential market for our company, and then what that size of the prize is and what's our right to win it. And then when we narrow it down to specific markets that meet our thesis. And this has been put in some of our public information and we've talked this with analysts. That is the industrial model, so working with our current industrial customers and potential some middle mile cargo transportation systems and logistics networks. The other part is pure regional mobility cargo transportation, supporting a network perhaps in Northern Europe and other places. And then the third is back to using our core competencies and white labeling for a large 121 carrier to provide airport transportation. So we see those as the initial markets and within the scope of our theses, of course, industry cargo first, then moving into the potential passenger markets. We think that for Bristow, on a top line basis, by 2030, 2031 is somewhere between, I gotta be careful what I say here, I don't know how to put any forward looking statements, but a sizable material market for the business. On hundreds of aircraft. I mean, it is public that we have placed orders for approximately 450 odd aircraft with the different, equipment manufacturers. We have put in capital now with some of those manufacturers, cause they've hit certain milestones in their processes. So we're on the road to doing that. We're looking at potential additional milestones met by this year. And we also believe that there's a potential that we could operate a small scale, electric aircraft, sometime this year or early next, and then potentially on the cargo side, early next year. Early aircraft in 2025.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, how has the market changed from two years ago?

Another thing that surprised me is I had expected more exits from the industry or consolidation. I was very pleased to see the Joby XWing consolidation. I'd like to potentially see more of that. There's just not enough capital that's going to be available for investment to meet this, the size of all the companies that are trying to enter into this market. So we're going to have to see that scale down. So I did expect more exits. I was somewhat surprised early on by Volocopter's, issue with the German government not being able to get the loan guarantees. I think that as the early investors, the SPACs have been done, the private equities coming, and it's not necessarily going to be there. You're going to need more government support, specifically the European companies. Whereas in the United States, I think that's the, Air Force program has helped really substantiate and validate the, equipment and provided a level of some revenue to support their operations. Those are the big surprises for me. I guess some people may say, are you not surprised by some of the delays in certification? I'm certainly not. We've built our models around potential aircraft moving out to the right. I also, and I said this today at Revolution Aero, it's not just the aircraft certification that's going to get delayed, but in my entire history of buying aircraft and delivering aircraft as a salesperson, I can't think of too many times we actually did it on time. There are always delays. People have robust schedules. They put them in place. So you have to build that resilience. So I'm certainly not surprised by the delays. I'm encouraged by it. I've also been encouraged by the latest, Advisor Circular that the FAA published recently, that aligns more with the EASA and gives some better direction on the vehicle certification and some of the other aspects of it. So not surprised, but very happy to see that. Really changes in the organization, no consolidation, no major exits to speak of, as surprised me for sure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What technology OEM operator has been the most significant positive surprise in the last year or so?

For personal reasons, one, I, I think that, one, he's within our portfolio and, one of the companies that we're really, hopeful for with Electra. Aero. Two, he's just a force of this industry with such a proven track record, and he's also influenced many of your other podcast people that have been on. They've either worked with him or worked for him within his team. And he's really spread his knowledge across the industry that, it's difficult to replicate and absolutely necessary. So I view as somebody that I would love to be able to emulate in any way, shape, or form. So hearing him speak about not what he's, just not what he's doing about this AAM industry, but is what he's doing potentially for STEM operations and his investments in things to get young people interested in aviation. I think it was just remarkable.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, thanks for being on, and good journeys back.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you.

If you do have the data and you want to run a one or half kilometer resolution model, it's going to take you computing resources, and that costs money and time, so you always have to worry, too, about turning these out fast enough. What good is a forecast if it comes out after the event. And the third one is the science. There's a reason why we can't forecast tornadoes perfectly, and there's still a lot of science. There's still a lot of things to learn. Even in icing, we have a lot of mysteries. So it's those three, but data is the key to improvement.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Don Berchoff, CEO of TruWeather. So I was really looking forward to this conversation with Don. Because as he says, weather imposes uncertainty, and uncertainty costs money. We've known for years, the cost of weather on traditional aviation. And listen up to the kinds of numbers that Don shares as those costs and what percentage of those costs are considered preventable. This discussion is essentially about what's possible in weather. Don says that aviation has gotten used to the lack of weather data and it's gotten used to uncertainty and that there are ways to improve weather today and in the future. Improvements that could dramatically improve flight operations and reduced costs, according to Don. Listen to what a weather pro says about the three things most needed for a better forecast. And according to Don, how data is key to improvement. We get into a discussion of weather on smaller things that fly. Drones and eVTOLs and other vehicles in advanced air mobility. Now Don talks about the need for better low altitude and micro weather and the need for better data for micro weather. He says that with drones, there's approximately a 40 to 50% attrition rate due to weather. But here's the challenge. Even though everyone says they need better systems in this case, better weather systems how much are they really willing to pay for those systems? This is one of the great challenges of selling technology to aviation. And Luka and Peter really challenged Don here. They know advanced air mobility is really thin profit and margins. And questioned their willingness to pay for better weather. But as Don counters though, they can't afford not to have better weather. So take it all in and many thanks to Don for joining us and to our many guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Don Berchoff as you innovate and The Vertical Space.

I think it's just a lack of understanding about, you know, what's possible with weather. And, so I, you know, when you asked me that question, I think of two industries. I think of my weather industry, which is, my home. And then I think of the, aviation industry, which is who we support and who I'm part of. The weather industry, I think, is in agreement with most of what we're going to talk about today, that there's a lack of low altitude weather data, that impacts predictions and that impacts uncertainty. I don't think anyone would argue with that. We might argue with how to close that gap and what's the right way to do it, but I think most people understand that gap. On the aviation side, the challenge that I've run into is most of your aviation folks who have been out there operating for lots of years have really gotten used to the lack of weather data. And they've kind of built it into their mindset or into their business model. So they're used to flying and dealing with the weather and overcoming uncertainty. And they really, sometimes they looked at me five years ago when I first entered this industry. And I said, this is going to be a challenge that for drones and air taxis, the lack of low altitude weather. And, they said, well, why are you trying to? You know, solve a problem that doesn't exist. That was actually quotes. And you know, it actually did exist, but they were used to it and they didn't understand what was possible. What I'm starting to see now is as folks are flying more in the industry, they're realizing, you know what, we're starting to see and understand the economics around weather data more than the safety component. You can always get around weather by not flying. And, we, we generally had about a 30%. of the time when manned aviation or crewed aviation didn't fly due to weather. They could have flown, but they didn't think of it that way. And so that's really where the mystery is going to get unlocked here. We're going to show them that you can, make more money with better weather data. We're going to show them you can reduce your risk. We can reduce your uncertainty. We can increase your passenger comfort. And you don't have to live with what you had because technology is changing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, why is there the difference between those who know weather and the aviation communities interface with weather? Why is there a difference?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's a really good question. so I'm going to bifurcate the weather industry a little bit for you. You have those that are scientists folks that are actually in the business of producing forecasts. And they really do understand the things we're talking about. You need more data to make a better forecast. That sounds like common sense, right? But it really isn't as obvious to everyone as you might think even in the weather industry, because we have, the business side of weather. And the business side of weather, came out of really the 1980s and 90s. You know, the government had been the monopoly in weather and it had to be. There was really no options. And what weather companies did initially is they would take that government data and they customize it or make it much more impactful to a decision. In the beginning we didn't really change the forecast. Other than the human would look at the data and have this interpretive skill and heuristics that they can make it better. And that was the customized weather. People paid for that because it was better than the forecast. But then we started adding more data, right? We started getting satellites up there that were commercial satellites. We've added more weather instruments that are, privatized. we have more commercial data. but the business model has always been, and still is, focused on taking data, through apps and advertising, right? So advertisement, I always consider in the weather industry, we have a conflict of interest. The conflict of interest is, if you're in the business of providing data on apps and you're selling advertising, you have a motivation to have people click your apps more, which means now you want to, make data more hyper exciting, right? And then you have the customized piece, which isn't scalable unless you change the technology, around it, which is what TrueWeather's doing. And we have folks that like the current business model. And they don't want to admit that there's a lack of data, because if they do, it says we have to change the business model, which would disrupt the weather business models that depend on apps and button clicks and just forecast or customize data. So there's that middle piece there. So I'm bifurcating, a little bit. Now aviation, I think the challenge is weather's very complex. And, you know, when I was in the Air Force, I was on Air Force bases with F 16 pilots trapped at Kunsan, they didn't want to hear about my excuses about weather. They just want to know why weren't you right? Right. And, there's a tendency to try to simplify this whole process so they can make a decision that they feel comfortable with. And I think, you know, when you start explaining that you could do more with this data or that data, what I've seen in the industry is that they worry about having to pay for the data now. See, they like free data and the problem is free data is not free because it costs money. So to go back to, the edict here, in 1998, the cost of, weather delays by major airlines on the U. S. economy was 41 billion a year. And this is lost productivity, this is, decisions that cost money, it's inconvenience to customers and clients, that number is much bigger today. And to try to explain to the aviation community that's been built in the current system that there's an economic argument to be made, they don't really see it because they're not worried about the bottom line as much as the CFO is of a company.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The cost of weather delays, the 40 odd billion per year, how much of that is due to low altitude weather?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This study I'm talking about was a 1998 Boeing study that said that they actually said the 41 billion dollars was the cost of weather on the U. S. economy due to delays by the aviation industry. This is what got my attention, they said 28 billion was avoidable. That was the, that's what got me interested in this problem. Because that told me that even back then it was the way decisions were being made that was also causing some of this uncertainty that led to, you know, this 28 billion. So now if you look at today and based on what I've learned through my work in the Air Force and studies that I've done that have been validated, 30%, roughly 30 percent of, I, I think is recoverable, and the percentage of that due to low altitude weather, you have to bifurcate it down now and say, okay, that's general aviation, because remember, big aircraft don't fly at low altitude, right? They come into airports, they're well instrumented. So you gotta look at this and say, who's impacted by it? It's helicopter pilots, it's general aviations, and now it's gonna be drones and air taxis. And what I'm seeing right now based on, I can't really talk about specifics, but we're getting about a 40-50 percent weather attrition rate, meaning cancellation rate right now for some low altitude operations that are happening with drones. And my estimate is about half of that is due to lack of low altitude weather. And about half of that's due to just decision systems that aren't able to take this data and present it in ways that help to make a better decision, right? I don't want to get into those details, but that's about the way I see it right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'd love to uncover a little bit more of this because it's intriguing your comment about how there is perhaps still pushback from the aviation side that, solving for this low altitude weather is, not really worth the effort, right? Yet the impact is monetizable, some of the studies that you quote. And so is that because really where the money is, the weather is not as big of a factor on the low level, But the majority of the impact then becomes on GA and yet this is an area right now where the cost of not flying is not as high, because if you're a GA pilot, you look out the window and you decide that you won't fly because of weather and it's not like there is an economic impact as a result of it for the most part, right? So can we maybe dissect this business problem a little bit more with some examples and some additional feedback and commentary that you're hearing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. So, let's take the helicopters, for example, right? If you talk to Rex Alexander, who is a significant advocate within the helicopter community, who also is trying to work with, you know, Oh, good. So, yeah, so Rex and I, you know, we have these conversations all the time. He's worked very hard to increase the ability of the, emergency helicopter HEMS, right, Helicopter Emergency Management Services, to improve their, readiness and their ability to respond, and do that in a way to try to improve weather information through a system that has been developed by, I think, NCAR and the National Weather Service have developed a system by which they try to better pull together the data we do have and try to better inform whether a helicopter should take a mission or not. Because remember, if there's an accident on a highway and you know, you have to decide whether you're going to send an airlift out there or you're going to bring an ambulance out there what you want to make sure is that if you're going to send that helicopter, it could get to where it has to go. And many times they will not take a mission because, remember, most flying helicopters does not occur at an airport. The airport's the only place that we measure weather right now. You don't get the measurements between airports. People don't understand, like, cloud height, visibility, measurements only happen at airports. That means 97 percent of the country, you have no measurements. There's no measurements. Satellite can't do it. There's nothing. Same with winds. Winds only get measured at airports when aircraft land, or with two balloon launches a day. We have a vast, desert of data below 5, 000 feet. The satellites get down to about 5, 000 and then they attenuate. There's some that get through, but it's not really relevant. This micro weather problem is the problem. We have always known it is a problem. There was a study done from the ground up. This was developed in 2008 by the National Academies that said we needed 400 profilers around the country to measure what we call the boundary layer up to 5, 000 feet on a regular basis, right, to get this sensor data so we can improve our modeling. So the helicopters may have to go to a hospital somewhere in the middle of an urban canyon that doesn't have even, it only has a windsock. There's no digital information and if there's fog or stratus they have to fly VFR. You just don't know if you can do it because we don't have data. So they'll drop that mission. They'll say, we can't take it and it could risk a life. And so they send an ambulance out. So that's an example of just one use case, but that magnifies itself across the board, right? Into both public safety, emergency response, and business, because we haven't talked about the business side yet of not flying that helicopter to the helicopter company or the hospital. That's just an example.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What other industry is more dependent on good weather than aviation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a really good question. I would say it depends on how you define good weather, right? If you're a farmer, you want rain. That's good weather, right? If you're a renewable energy farm, you want winds. That's good weather, right? But it may not be good for your picnic. So, I always say it's the use case that drives that question. Now, you're talking about a really nice day where that's probably tourism, Because, you know, people want to go to the beach.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How about the ability to predict weather accurately, whether it be good or bad? What industry is more dependent on that, or is more affected by it? You just said there's a 40 billion study on cost and delays and cancellations. That's a significant cost to the industry. What other industry is more affected?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I'm gonna blow your mind now. In 2017, the cost of weather on the US economy was 634 billion a year. And that covers agriculture, renewable energy, construction, logistics, transportation. These are all industries that are affected by weather, and they all need micro weather, by the way. But the challenge has been is we haven't been able to build the business case to close these gaps, to collect that micro weather, because these industries, there's no real coalition. The other problem is the government can't afford to put that out, that infrastructure. I was a science and technology director at the weather service for four years. I had a 130 million budget, and I learned pretty quickly that the money that we're spending on infrastructure in the government has to be on strategic infrastructure, such as satellites and things of that sort. And we have gotten much better at long range forecasting because of satellites. But when it gets to the microweather, we haven't really invested in that. And so that's like the nearest target, but yet the hardest to solve because of the resources. So if you think about it, agriculture can use microweather, renewable energy, right? They want if, you know, every time winds are off by one or two knots from the forecast, the renewable energy farm could be hit with millions and millions of dollars because they think they're going to generate a certain amount of power. They've got a contract to generate that power, and they may have to go to the spot market now to buy fossil fuels to make up for the difference they're losing. And that costs them lots of money.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Don, this deficiency microweather out weather that you talk about is it really a statement that we need more weather observations, in order to have a better picture of micro weather or do we have enough input data and the answer is somewhere else in this chain?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you talk to folks that are trying to demonstrate that they are developing a micro weather forecast because it is a requirement, and people do need it. They're using techniques that downscale models, but not adding new data below 5, 000 feet. Just so you understand, the global models are like 9km resolution right now. That's the best. That's European. It means that every grid space is 9x9km, which means everything in that grid space looks the same. You're not resolving anything in that other than the average. Our short range models in the United States are three kilometer resolution, which is probably like a mile and three quarters or two miles. Those are in those grids you're not resolving anything below that. So if you try to continue to drive that resolution higher by getting down to one kilometer by one kilometer or 500 meters, you're not adding new data into the set. you're just, all you're doing is you're making it look better. You're making the pictures look really better, but it doesn't mean the data is accurate. You need real data just like anything else. You have to have data in order to do improvements to forecasts. There's also modeling. The modeling has to get better. There's physics and then the computing. So the three things that make a better forecast are data, computing, because you need speed. If you want to, if you do have the data and you want to run a one or half kilometer resolution model, it's going to take you computing resources, and that costs money and time, so you always have to worry, too, about turning these out fast enough. What good is a forecast if it comes out after the event. And the third one is the science. I mean, we're not, there's a reason why we can't forecast tornadoes perfectly, and there's still a lot of science. There's still a lot of things to learn. Even in icing, we have a lot of mysteries. So it's those three, but data is the key to improvement. You can't do machine learning without data. What I'm seeing in the industry is people are doing machine learning, but they're using analysis data. So the way we do historical weather in the weather community we don't have data everywhere, so you have to build a grid. You have to take the data you have, and then you build a grid, and you match that up against your physical models, and then you estimate what you think is happening in between those, and then you get a grid of historical data. But guess what? That's not real data. And people are using that kind of historical grid today, which is 15 kilometers or more resolution to run machine learning. And after they run the machine learning, they can't even validate it's right because there's no data. So, you know, that's the dirty secret in weather. Now, there are machine learning techniques that make sense, that you can do, like if you have weather radar, that you at least have real data, right? You're getting data. Although, keep in mind, weather radar is not necessarily always what it seems. Because you can have, areas that the radar beam goes above the precip, and it may be precipitating, and you're not going to see it on the radar. Right? So these are the, this is all the problems with weather instrumentation. There's no perfect solution with instruments. You have to build a village of sensors. Satellite, radar, lidar, remote sensing, you know, that kind of thing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So two questions. One, is is there a well executed accuracy assessment in the weather industry to track these various forecasts against what actually happened, so that we have an objective understanding of, okay, you have these large grids, we don't have differentiation inside, people are doing interpolation, they're training models off of those interpolations rather than off of actual observed data. But who's measuring how accurate that actually is and do we even have agreement on that, within the sector, within the industry, whatever you want to call it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, the, global models are being actively validated by the MET services. So ECMWF, National Weather Service, they are validating their models. The usefulness of that depends on what you're trying to measure. So, if you're trying to understand how accurate your winds are at 20, 000 feet, you're going to use a combination of satellite observation, and, balloon launches and maybe aircraft observations. And you, again, you're gonna map that out and potentially put it in a grid again. And you may not have a perfect real historical data set, but you have what's the best you can have. That would be on the average how you would, validate a model, using an analysis of the best data you can have and fitting it to a grid. Now, if you're talking about an airport, and you're just interested in validating your forecast at an airport for ceiling height, that's the best example of a really good validation, right? You can say, okay, I have measurements of ceiling. They come in every hour or more often. I can take a grid point out of my model and I can say, what's the ceiling forecast, what's the visibility forecast, the temperature for at that location. And that would be, that's your best set of data to do validation. So the problem is in between. So you have a point, and then you have an area. When you start looking at area, then it becomes more difficult to put a lot of confidence in all your validation. And so what TruWeather's doing, so, you know, just to give you an example, the low altitude has no validation except at a ground level at the airport. And that to me doesn't matter because drones don't fly at airports. And eVTOLs and air taxis mostly won't be flying at airports. They'll be flying out of urban centers that we have no data today. We don't know what the winds are doing in the urban canyons. We have no validation of that. All we could do is run models of what we think is happening. And they're not very good because there are a lot of estimates going into them. So, what we're doing is saying, look, we can't solve world hunger, but, when I saw the drone and air taxi industry coming up in 2017, I said, this is the best business model we've ever had for microweather. Now, you might say, well, what about agriculture, what about, yeah, they're all important. But when I say business model, I meant the ubiquitous nature, the amount of traffic that's going to be flying in certain areas. And the ability to amortize that cost of better services across a much larger array of companies and use cases. And so, my thesis has been and still is that we fill these low altitude weather gaps with ground based infrastructure and with drones that can collect weather data. And we use the satellites and we use the radar and we bring that together around corridors that are going to be your highest use corridors. Let's focus on that. We get real data now. When we run our models, we can validate that data, and we can then do real machine learning. That's the thesis.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You've painted a picture of the weather gaps that I was not aware of. I did not realize it was all generally around the airports. And, but I want to go back to, before we get to the microweather, talk about the use case, talk about the gap that you're filling. I just want to pull it right back just a little bit to commercial aviation. You mentioned the 40 billion dollars in delays, diversions, and cancellations due to weather, you're saying, and you're saying a large portion of that is preventable. So let's eat into that a little bit. You were part of the NextGen weather ConOps. What could we do today to put a dent? If you're saying a large percent of that is preventable. What could we do today to be able to help address those preventable weather delays? How could better weather, better predictions, more accurate predictions help? And how do we do it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, it's a very good question. I was involved in the JPDO back in 2005 for NextGen. I helped write the weather ConOps I had my, you know, we worked with a couple of folks. We had a vision that, you know, we would have to run more modeling, collect more data, improve the microweather. Cause keep in mind, even around, even at an airport, you're going to have microweather challenges, right? If you've ever been to San Francisco, you know about the fog that sometimes really messes up Air New Zealand coming in. And the challenge is that, you've got to improve the micro weather for the current aviation to help with that understanding of how airport delays are going to impact the system. Now, when Boeing said, because it wasn't me, 28 billion was recoverable, I mean, obviously that's a perfect system, right? We built this, NextGen weather. We couldn't get DOT and NOAA to agree who was going to pay for it. That's how simple this problem was, right? You try to go back to OMB, and I have all this experience in government, so, you go, we went to OMB, we said, look, we need to make this a, interagency kind of thing. I'm going to be frank, DOC, Department of Commerce, they've got their budget. And, NOAA has their budget. And Weather Service has their budget. And, in order to improve and get to what is really required, requires big investments in computing, big investments in other things. We couldn't even get them to agree who's going to pay for it. So that's the first challenge is just the bureaucracy. Then you have the challenge of the current systems that operators are using, we're using a lot of legacy systems in aviation that, NextGen ran into this problem, right? They said, we, you want us to equip our aircraft and do what and pay for what, and then we have to change our software. So the problem is, I made a decision that problem is intractable, right? Let's go after the low hanging fruit. Let's go after a new industry. I think the only way you're going to get to what you asked me, is by demonstrating it. And showing people how bad it really, I mean, how much it's really, costing you and then demonstrating there is a solution, right? And so then I started working with the ASTM. We rewrote the FAA to their credit, said, yes, we got to change the way weather data is collected. We've got to open up the spigot. We can't just collect data at airports anymore and say, that's the only approved data. We rewrote the standard. We got it through. It's published. FAA is working with us right now on how we can test and demonstrate that. Which means then we'll be able to get more data collected through IoT and other things as long as they follow certain rules, right? So that was always my thesis. I gave up on the big picture, right? I said, let's focus on what we can control. Helicopters have always been the bastard childs of weather. So I always knew they would be a fan. And this is where it's going. So that's kind of my answer. I know it's not a great answer, but I'm telling you exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Who's most benefited from low level weather and who really is not being affected at all.

What I was trying to get at is that you can take a lot more weather on an aircraft that's engineered, it's heavy, it's big, it can carry regular fuel, not battery power. You can put more gas on it. You have a pilot who can deal with, unexpected circumstances that will come up because we don't forecast perfectly. And you have a pilot who has flown routes that they know the local weather effects better than the weather people because you don't have the data and they never come back and tell us what they experience because they want to have that as a secret so they can get us later when they say, Oh, I told you it would be that way. I'm kidding. But, the bottom line is that you cannot scale this industry if you don't have better digital information, because that pilot today might be sitting a thousand miles away from where they're flying their drones. They want to fly one too many. There's no way the pilots can even know what's going on. They don't even wake up in the same environment that they're flying in. All those heuristics are gone. I'm sorry to say, Mr. Pilot, it's useless. Because now you're flying somewhere where you've never flown before, you've never experienced the weather, you don't even wake up in the same location that you're flying you're weather blind. And if we don't backfill that information with real data, you're going to have more uncertainty and you're going to be cancelling missions more than you have to. And you cancel them today when you could fly. 30 percent of the time when you cancel a weather, a mission due to weather, you could fly. I know you know that because you always get mad at us when we say you can't fly and then you go, I could have flown today. That's money. And that happens in manned aviation. Imagine uncrewed. Imagine lighter aircraft. Imagine a consumed data source. I mean a conserved data, a power source. You can't add more power on a battery. So now you have to make decisions. How far am I going to go? How much weight can I carry? How much recharge time do I have? And if you're flying people, how bumpy is it going to be? Now this is a totally different environment. So that gets back to your original question. What is it that many few people agree with you, Don? They disagree with me about what I'm saying because they can't see the alternative reality that's going to occur in five years. Every knot of wind is going to be battery power, just like the renewable energy. It means weight, it means distance, it means something. And, that's the bottom line. I mean, I don't see it any other way because I'm so deep in it and I know it, you know, I could see the future on this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The tendency to cancel due to weather, being, too conservative today. I totally agree with you. I was frustrated with that when I was flying. But at the same time, the cost of traditional manned aviation missions, especially in military is much higher, right? And there's human lives that you're putting at risk. And so there's a tendency to err on the side of safety. But when you're dealing with drones, whose flights are really short to begin with, who don't necessarily have a high cost of returning home, if the weather turns out to be not good enough. That calculus is a little bit different for that segment of aviation. I guess what I'm trying to unpack a little bit more is who sees the business value in this? There's no doubt that there is a gap, but how do you monetize this? Who is it that will take that data, that new weather, granular micro low level weather and have a disproportionately higher impact on their business?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's a lot to unpack there, right? So, we could talk about the military. Military is about bombs on target, reaching objectives. It's a different calculus, right? It's also about asset efficiency, asset management, because if you have limited resources and low density, high demand assets, if they're getting canceled due to wet weather, unnecessarily, you're not covering an area over the battle space that needs to be covered. So I can make the argument from a military perspective, which I'm very good at because I was in it about how, you need to be considering efficiency and using your assets in the military environment because they're not unlimited, right? And I proved that at the TACC. So, in the year 2000, I got to the Tanker Airlift Control Center at Scott Air Force Base. I was asked to build a regional weather squadron. I was the first and we built it to 108 people. And then I was at the Air Operations Center. We also supported TACC. And the first thing I noticed is that I was watching how planners and dispatchers were making decisions about how to allocate those airlift assets in those refueling assets around the world. And I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Weather wasn't even in the calculus. They would just plan and say we don't change based on a weather forecast. You've heard that before. I know that because you're in the military, right? So I watched this for a while and I said to my boss, the two star General Woolley, I said, there's low hanging fruit here. You know, we're not perfect at forecasting, but I could tell you. We are certain about certain forecasts, and if we're certain enough about those, why don't we take that into consideration when we're planning these missions? It doesn't mean we change everything. Let's just take a very focused risk management approach to this, where if we're really confident you change that mission profile, you're going to save resources. So he, he was game and we did that. And in one year we cut the delays. They were averaging 5, 000 delays a year from weather out of 100, 000 missions. So 5% In one year we cut it to 1800. So AMC says, what does that mean for us? And I said, well, let's take it to your financial analysts. How many more aircraft do you need to make that up? And what we found was that we saved them 200 million with that. So that's what's falling on the floor today. So we got that study. I'll share it with you. It was validated and we were nominated for the Chief of Staff Team Excellence Award and AMC made us validate everything because they didn't want to be embarrassed, right? So fast forward, that's what I'm using right now for this whole industry. But that was a military example. Now let me give you a commercial example. So I was up at eVTOL Insights two years ago and I had been asked to make a presentation. I was going to be one of the later in the day presentations and there was an OEM, one that everybody knows and is well familiar with that got up in the morning and said, I just happened to be in New York City where I grew up. So you're really in my backyard and I understand weather there. And they said we're going to fly air taxies and we're going to fly eight missions a day with one eVTOL. I said, okay. And, he said, we're going to generate 14 million a year. And I sat there and said, no, you're not, you haven't included the 30 percent weather tax. And it was at that moment that I trademarked the term weather tax because it hit me. People have to understand who are the people that care most about money in a company, the CFO, right? If I use the term tax, that's going to get their attention. So I got up in the end of the day and I said, look, You got a 30 percent weather tax in New York City, and people look at me like, what are you talking about? And I said, that's the price Mother Nature imposes upon your business, both real or perceived, because part of that tax is the time that you ground yourself when you could fly, based on uncertainty. And I said, so you're really going to generate 9. 8 million per aircraft. That's what's going to happen. And, of course,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Why 30%?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, well, I took my lessons from the TACC, and I took, other data, that we've collected to show that, about, on the average, depending on the city, you know, it all changes. I also said all the weather tax is all local, like politics, right? It changes based on the regime and the weather. But, generally speaking, when I look at all the studies that have been out about AAM, they just look at actual real weather impacts. They say, oh, the weather will be 15 or 20 percent, 50 percent of the time you won't be able to fly, right? But I know that you have to add that uncertainty piece in. So I take that as an average. I feel pretty good about it, right? 30 percent of the time, you're gonna be, impacted if you don't build a better system. So I said to him, look, I said, 30 percent of that's recoverable. I'm pretty confident of that. Probably more, but let's just give you a low hanging fruit. 30 percent is recoverable. So I said, first of all, you're really going to only generate 9. 8. Which they didn't like. And I said, but I could get you back 30 percent of that. And I said, for each aircraft, if I have the right systems in place in an urban area, I could get you back 30%. Think about what that is. That's like 1. 2 million a year, right? Then I looked at him, I said, how much will you pay for that? I said, don't you tell me that, I'm going to talk to your CFO. I said, if I could show you that, how much would you pay? I maintain they'll pay at least five to one, four to one return on investment. We could generate two to three hundred thousand per aircraft for weather alone. We're working right now with NASA, We're implementing, Urban Weather Sensing testbed at Hampton, we're bringing it out to Dallas, it's going to be around Alliance Airport, and we're going to do more of the economic studies behind this. But my argument is that you will pay me for that, if I could show you that I can get you more flight time, and by the way, more reliability for your customer, and if we have the better data, we can keep you out of rough air, we don't have to get people sick. Who are not going to come back on these small vehicles if they're getting sick. All these things. So, it's really hard to believe, right? I mean that this is possible, but that's kind of where my whole career has taken me to this point. It's all been a lifetime of work to get here and then to see the possibilities and now we're acting upon it and hopefully, you know, we'll be successful.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For me, it's not that difficult to understand the value prop as you're describing to me, what I'm curious to learn more about is how do you convince those customers that this actually is achievable and is real, right? Because it kind of goes back to how do you convince people in one weather app being more accurate than another. There's no easy way to validate it. You need to run, large scale, experiments and testing and retroactive analysis. What is the second and third and the fourth conversation and the conversation with the CFO organization look like, can you give us a sense of their skepticism? You're having to convince them how this discussion evolves.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, I mean, that's the big problem, right? So that's why I didn't go into conventional aviation because that would be an impossible thing to prove. When I saw the new industry, I said, this is all new software. It's all open data systems. We have ability now to actually make a new market around weather that is working in concert with the industry in understanding how they're using data in all areas of the industry, not just weather. How the FAA is moving to a performance risk based standard for weather, but for everything in aviation. So this is really being embedded and baked in right now into the industry as we go along. NASA's given us several SBIRs and we're going to be going out to Alliance Airport around Hillwood and, and we're going to be putting in three scanning wing LIDARs. We're going to put in the infrastructure that we think is required to get the data we need to run the high resolution modeling and to then be able to run those models every 15 minutes with winds that are unimaginably accurate compared to what you have today. And we're gonna, we have an economist, and we're gonna work with the operators, and that's the next step in the process. I realize you have to prove it. The thing I'm saying is I have no doubt that once we collect that data, if somebody wants to deny it, then it's not going to be rational. It's going to be because of their own personal culture, what they've been raised in, and how insistent they are that the way we used to do it is the right way to do it. I think we'll be able to show that. I just have to sit down with the number counters and show them the results. We have to have a clean slate, we got to throw away the past, we got to look at the future, and then we got to realize the software that's being built in this new system is very easy to work with. So what I did with the ASTM, as I said, all weather data has to be translated into JSON, GeoJSON, not weather geekism. I mean, one of the problem with weather data is it comes in so many shapes and sizes that people can't even get to it to use it properly. So I'm taking a holistic approach and saying this industry is the test for what I'm saying and NASA's been behind us and the FAA's behind us. I'm not going to tell you yet that it's assured. But what I will tell you is that I know you can't do better without better data. There's no data in the urban canyons. You can't run CFD modeling without real data to know what's really happening.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the air taxi use case, like you go back to the New York scenario and you postulate that with these micro weather forecasts, predictions into the future, what the weather will be at that very granular locale, that these operators will be able to, fly more often, but how does that fit into their ability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Or carry more weight, or carry more\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>weight. Okay. But how does that fit into they're improving their profitability on their bottom line because how many hours or days ahead are they typically selling a ticket for that scheduled flight wherever the passenger is going and are you going to be forecasting, so far ahead of time that they can, cancel the flight before the ticket is sold? Or are they selling a ticket and then canceling a flight before departure? How does that time window work? And the contrast in commercial aviation is really quite different because. Well, number one, commercial aviation is so weather resilient that they only cancel when the weather gets to a real extreme. People are buying those tickets, days, weeks, even months ahead of time. But, you know, in, in the overall spectrum of weather, they're, they'll fly in instrument conditions, they'll fly in visual conditions, they'll fly in a lot of conditions and the transportation mode is pretty resilient to the weather, until you get to an extreme. But in these air taxis, from what I've gathered so far is a lot of these are going to be VFR operations. And so they themselves are just inherently more sensitive to weather conditions. If you realize this ability to predict whether it's not a weather observation, but it's the ahead of time factor that it brings, how does that match up with the eVTOL passenger when they plan to buy that ticket? And how does it mesh with, the operators, need to cancel and their ultimate profitability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good question.

But here's the thing is that, remember I said, you know, I'm not trying to solve the long range forecast problem. That's beyond my pay grade, right? As you mentioned earlier, you have to run large simulations. We're running a very localized microweather model that could be a 10 by 10 kilometer area or even less. We're going to use the initial conditions that come in from the bigger models. Then we're going to have our data coming in our sensors that nobody else has. And then we're going to nudge that and rerun that model with our data. And then we're going to run a short range forecast, probably out to six hours. Now, you might say to me, well, Don, is six hours enough? Well, the answer is, we're not trying to solve the whole problem. We're trying to go after the most impactful part of the problem. People are going to buy tickets when they buy them. The question is, and I always tell this to people in the military, because remember, I went to National War College, I have a degree in National Military Strategy, and I always brought weather in as part of the campaign, right? I believe weather is a weapon, weather, anticipate and exploit, you know, using it against the enemy. And I also ran an Air Force base. So I understand the logistics. I ran the main staging base in Afghanistan. And so I, I practice a lot of what I'm talking about today and I tested it in real life, but what I'm saying is that last six hours is the key, right? Because now you still have options at six hours out, or even three hours out. The key is not committing somebody to come to a VertiPort where they cannot take ground transportation to get to the airport. That's the key. Period. And that's what we're focusing on. And we're also building an intermodal system. We just won a DOT Smart Grant with Fort Worth, City of Fort Worth. We're going to bring weather into this, as well as air. And we're going to start looking at how, if you can't get to the VertiPort, or if the VertiPort cancels two hours ahead of time, can we get you in an Uber Black, what those road conditions are going to look like. All this predictability, we are just a chaotic transportation service today, right? This is about just bringing more discipline and better data into the system into these decisions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, help me out. So, one way to answer Peter's question, I believe. Again, you got me at today, most of your sensors are at the airports. So what you're saying is, I would assume with drone operations, drone delivery operations, eVTOL, those things that fly low altitude it's going to be, really important to have good weather. Peter's asking, so what? Peter's saying, well, what difference will it really make? So it's possible, even though they plan that advance. Very good point Peter on the commercial side. People already bought their tickets and they're already at the airport. Now it is true. They may not cancel because of weather, because they can fly in almost anything, but there'll be massive, unnecessary delays because isn't good weather prediction. And so I think that's a very big part of the 28 to 30 billion dollars. If I only knew really what was going to happen. So in your case, it's possible what you're saying is, because of the big chunks of grid today that weather is done on, if I know much more accurately where the real weather would be, because of your sensors, for example they're less apt to cancel flights that they otherwise would have cancelled because there is no weather in that spot. And I'm guessing that's where your three or four million dollars, a year per operation would come from. Is that right? Is that kind of the so what, the way I'm reading\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it? Yeah. You got it. So what is, today you would can't, you know, you might have, I've seen this already. I've worked with some companies where they would have to cancel going back to Peter's point. I was driving away from the long range into the short range. So what was happening is they were doing testing, of some of these concepts. And they would have to cancel the mission two or three hours in advance because they didn't want to bring the people out to the VertiPort only to be stuck there. Or in the opposite state, you're at the airport and they're expecting an air taxi, and now you're not going to have it. So they're going to have to find another means of transportation. That's not as bad as the other one, right? Where you can't get to the VertiPort and now you've waited. You're only an hour and a half before takeoff because you thought you were going to fly there, and now you can't get to the airport now because traffic in those areas won't allow it. So, they were making this no go decision about two, two and a half hours before. Well, a lot of times they could have flown, and this is something they told me. So that's where the 30 percent comes in, right? So now we bring them out 30 percent of the time more than we did, and they're going to fly and they're going to make money. And they're not going to be sitting there with the empty aircraft sitting on the VertiPort, not flying and all the costs that goes with that. Does that help a little bit? I'm glad you helped me tease that out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It does. Help me out a little bit with, drone delivery services. Our sense is that eVTOLs are still several years away at scale, potentially more than that. some would say, but drone service delivery is happening today, and it's going to happen at scale a whole lot faster, arguably, than eVTOL operations. How does micro weather help, now you got me talking only micro weather, so you've trained me. How does micro weather help make a difference to the drone service delivery Does it really, will they make any different decisions based on better weather.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I would say just on, on Jim's question, when you're thinking about drone delivery, and let's just take last mile drone delivery, because so many people have a pretty vivid picture of what it is, that's going to operate more based on microweather observations than forecasts. And, you know, consumers will open the app and they will either be able to place that order or not, because this is all taking place within a matter of minutes. It's, you know, it's not like I'm ordering something three, four, five, six hours ahead of time and making some kind of a decision based on that. It's immediate. So it's just, okay, what is the weather along this two, three mile route right now or 15 minutes in the future? And can we go?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the things I want to point out is micro weather doesn't become as important if you're not flying scheduled missions. If you're not depending on velocity, where your business model depends on having a lot of flights, right? If you're doing surveillance on a pipeline And you could wait another day. It doesn't become as much of an issue. So, the drone delivery one is one of those that really depends on volume. And so every mission you don't fly you're dropping revenue that probably hasn't been told to your investor about how much the weather challenge is. So there's a lot of pressure on these companies. You got to remember, it's not like the current airlines who have baked in weather already, right? These are all folks that are going after VC money or other money. And they're, you know, they're embellishing a little bit of their abilities to fly, 95 percent of the time when it's really maybe around 20, right? So now they're already behind the power curve. The challenges with drone delivery is the winds above the tree level is not measurable and we see a lot of difference in the winds above tree level than the models put in there. The battery power issue, the weight carried issue. It just adds chaos into the system as well as the problem of you have to have three miles visibility you have to you know, be 500 feet below a cloud deck, all those things. Right. So you notice, I even talk about a thunderstorm because the thunderstorm stuff we see coming. It's the micro weather that's invisible or not notable that's going to hurt their business model. So, So, you're right. Now, one thing I will say, Peter, is that you really need about an hour, ahead of time because, you gotta remember there is an operation, there are people loading drones, they're running around the store picking stuff up, so, you know, if somebody puts in an order, it's not like it's gonna happen in 10 minutes, generally, right? So you have to think about the flow. So, if you have, I don't know, just to say you have 15 drones at a Walmart someday, right? That's 15 drones. That's a lot of drones? So every 10 minutes you're not flying when you can fly, you've just dropped 15 drone flights. So even the short range, and you do need the data, as you said. So what we've been advocating for is let's get some wind sensors on towers at 200 feet, 100 feet, 150 feet. Let's get above the tree line. Once we know what the winds are really doing, which we don't have today, that takes away some of the mystery immediately about power management, distance traveled, wind shear, there's other things I could talk about. And then let's get a ceilometer at every Walmart or wherever you're flying from so we can see the cloud height, measure it, because right now they're using the nearest METAR. And the nearest METAR could be 15 miles away and it may not even be relevant. You've been on airports where one half of the runway is IFR and the other half is clear, right? I used to, that happened to me at Kunsan. I used to get yelled at all the time by the wing commander because we would call it seven miles visibility but the approach end of the runway, which was less than a quarter of the area drone, was socked in but I couldn't call that visibility. He threatened to put me on a boat at the end of the runway to take my weather observation. So, my point is that all that comes together. So you're right. The data is important. Having that extra information is important. And then you still need a short range forecast for your flow to manage your logistics, right? To make sure you're not taking orders that you know you're not going to be to\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>meet. Don, you mentioned earlier that about 40 percent of drone flights are canceled due to weather. Can you talk more about that? And, you know, maybe be a little bit more specific who do you refer to when you mentioned this, and if you talk to drone delivery organizations that are really starting to have some meaningful and interesting scale, companies like Wing, like Manna. Do they have this problem? Do they, complete your sentences when you talk about the issues of winds aloft and how they're not able to predict those and how this impacts their customer service ultimately. Do you have an agreement on the impact that this is having on their operation and how do they think about this? Do you work with them? Do you provide services to them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good question. So what I will tell you is I, we are a Drone Ups company. I'm proud of the fact that they hired us, over another company after they realized that what we're producing is meaningful to them. They've acknowledged the challenges of micro weather, keep in mind that, when I say 40%, it doesn't mean the weather was bad 40 percent of the time. It means that you just don't know. So, that statistic really depends on where you're, what your weather challenges are, right? Some people might think, oh, in Phoenix, you probably don't have a 40 percent attrit. Well, I don't know the winds, right? The winds above the ground, you know, they can't handle 30 knots of wind necessarily above the ground, right? So your weather attrit is not seemingly the same as what you would think about for a regular aviation, right? That number seems high if you're not really on the ground and understanding what's happening. What we tell them, you know, is that we'll get you that, some of that back. And it means that you have to buy into the whole system. You've got to buy into the system of better sensors above tree level, some ceilometers, the way that we, aggregate data and present it through custom, outputs for locale and your decisions. You've got to make very systematic approaches to how decisions are made. You can't leave it up to a local pilot, to make that decision because they don't have the big picture. So this is the kind of work we're doing with DroneUp is trying to figure out how do we, really, you know, it's not just the data collection side, it's also the decision side, right? And how you build the system so that those decisions are made in a systematic fashion, that there's a stable process. I could talk about other drone companies. I don't want to do that because some drone companies don't want to admit there's a problem yet because they're still trying to, raise money. Others, are doing certain things that they feel they can handle it themselves, which may be possible. I just know I've been in the business long enough to know that you can't, if you're going to be a successful low altitude drone company or eVTOL company, you can't just look at weather as a data supplier. You have to have partnerships. There's even a meteorologist piece to this. There'll be times when you're going to have an area that has lots of drones that you want to fly and there's a system coming in and the models are going to say, you know, that system will be, you'll be getting rain at 30%. You know, one of the things I'm finding is what does a 40 percent chance of rain mean? Do you cancel? How do you make a decision with that, right? So, what we say is you talk to our meteorologist, we'll help, we'll get you an extra hour of flight time, potentially, because we say, oh, that 40 percent is happening north, it's not going to move down into your area for another hour. There's no automated weather today that could be the heuristical part of that, like you used to get when you talk to a forecaster. There's still going to be a requirement to have meteorologists in a loop until we're perfect at forecasting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Assuming a drone delivery operation is happening from a hub and covers, let's say a four mile radius, how much does it cost a drone operator to instrument this particular area with the necessary sensors, and then also get the meteorological service from you. What is that burden on an annual basis or on a per flight basis, and how does that fit into the overall economics of those delivery operators?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so I don't want to give you all those details because that's my IP, but what I will tell you is this. Our goal is to get them four times return on investment. When we talk about sensors, when we talk about integration, when we talk about APIs, and when we talk about getting those APIs properly integrated into, their decision support systems that they're doing. And when we talk about even having a forecaster in the loop every now and then, you don't have them every day, you only have them on the edge cases, you call them up. The goal is a 4 to 1 return on investment. So I'll give you an example. If they're losing, 40 percent of their missions today, we want to get it down to 30%. And if that revenue, we want to get you, we want to get you, you know, we don't want you to pay more than 25 percent of what that savings is. And that doesn't even get into the cost avoidance piece. I'm just talking about revenue right now. We're not even talking about people that are standing around and I've seen this doing nothing because they're waiting for the rain to end, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It seems like, the customers who could benefit the most from this, if I'm interpreting your, arguments correctly are the, high frequency, low altitude operators, drone delivery operations, for instance, right in the near term. Those are also, customers who are very pressured by, cost. And they are looking at every single cent and asking themselves the question, can I afford to spend this cent because my unit economics are really challenging to maintain and achieve. We see this often with, all kinds of supplemental data providers that yes, have a lot of value, but, you know, drone operators might only have the capacity to pay cents per flight for some of this data. So in that context, how do they prioritize the value of weather data and their willingness to, give up margin for it, as opposed to best effort, if I need to cancel a flight, I'll cancel a flight, I'll send it a minute later or a couple of minutes later, because it's really at a small scale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first of all, all those other methods cost money. So if you've canceled a mission because you didn't have good data, and you then had to drive that or find an Uber Eats guy to take it, you've just spent money. We're looking at this the wrong way. You're looking at weather as a cost of doing business. Weather is an enabler to make money. That's the problem I run into all the time. I'm not criticizing. I'm saying that what we're up against is a culture of how people think about weather. Everyone thinks about the cost, but nobody recognizes weather's costing them. You know, there's no such thing as free weather data. It's costing you. So, what I would tell you is this, and again, some of this has to be proven, but I'm, you know, there's an old saying, I don't know this to be a fact, but I know it to be true, right? Weather may cost you overall today, 60 cents a drone flight when you amortize all the impacts of weather on your ecosystem. If you amortize that cost, it might cost you 60 cents a drone flight. Alright, if you start paying me 15 cents a drone flight, I'm not, I'm using this as an example, and I save you 60 cents, I don't understand where the problem is. Why are we prioritizing? You're going to have to lay somebody off instead, or you're going to have to cut costs somewhere else, or, and this is what I say all the time in weather. It's amazing how much value there is here that people haven't realized yet, and they're actually cutting costs in areas that they don't have to if they just have a smarter weather system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. These drone companies that, that we've talked to, they have weather minimums where they are flying with about a 50 percent safety margin on wind conditions, rain, etc. So they have a pretty wide safety margin for their go no go. But obviously they want better dispatchability. They want to fly more often.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we want to get that safety margin down.

I mean, and a lot of it has its roots in the amount of energy that the drone can bring along with it on the mission. And so we know batteries are getting better. We know drones are being built that can handle stronger winds. They can handle more moisture in the air. Icing will always be a challenge, but short of that, I think we see the weather performance of these drone systems improving a lot in the coming years. So, how does that trend fit in with what you are offering to them on a forecast basis? And I would just assume that they're going to, keep the same 50 percent type safety margin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:04:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, if you're assuming they're going to keep the same 50 percent safety margin, then there's no business model. Because that, they're, for some reason, they're doing that. But back to the, the question, the bottom line is this, is that we have very sophisticated aircraft today that are manned and they, and we still ground these aircraft 30 percent of the time unnecessarily. The same thing is going to happen when you have your very sophisticated drones. If you ever use the term all weather, be careful, because there's no such thing. I've been told we can have all weather aircraft since 1980s. There's no all weather aircraft. The more you engineer, the more weight you put on an aircraft, there's always a trade off between engineering, weight, and everything else. So I've been in this a long time. It really comes to this way. You have to improve your engineering, but you have to improve your weather resiliency from a prediction standpoint. You have to work them both together. There's no one or the other. You're always going to have weather impacts and you're always going to have margins that you're going to give up if you don't improve the data. I mean, why wouldn't you want to invest in better data and get more margin and get more flights. I mean, this doesn't make sense to me. I mean, maybe I'm, I don't know. I don't get it. Right. I don't get why you have to have a 50 percent safety if you're got better weather data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there other alternative funding sources that are available for your capability or your competitors?

If they're looking at every cent, which they are today, and you're saying, but there's real value here, and they're just prioritizing their dollar, is there an opportunity for the government, any kind of consortiums to help underwrite the costs of the microweather?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. To answer your question, I don't expect the operators to pay, the full cost of this. There's two things I want to mention. Number one is once we get these low altitude weather networks out, they're going to be able to serve other verticals that today are underserved. So if you think about the urban canyons, there's a lot of air pollution. There's a lot of concern about how air pollution moves around transport through urban canyons. This data is not only going to be valuable to aviation, it's going to become valuable to many other verticals and they will buy it at some point. This just hasn't been a business model. The second thing I want to mention is that the states, can invest in infrastructure. So the way I break it down is this way. You have strategic weather infrastructure and then you have tactical weather infrastructure. The strategic weather infrastructure would be like those scanning wind lidars. You don't expect companies to pay, anybody to pay for that, right? Either that's going to be private investment, helping to fund that, that would then, you know, buy into that based on the business model, or we look at public private partnerships like toll roads. Right? So we could see that the states, there's like five business models where the states can actually buy some infrastructure, but then just contract out the maintenance, the data processing, and then, you know, you work out the business model with the state. Maybe, they get a discount for all public safety to use the data, right? And then you charge commercial some fee. There's a bunch of different business models that can make this work, which is why, I'm not landing on one solution. I'm still figuring out all the things that you guys have brought up, I'm well aware of. And so I've been working on the approaches to try to get around those, objections, right? So to speak, to try to find a way to make this work, to make it profitable and make it work. So I don't see the, drone operators having to buy all the infrastructure. I see them buying a service. And that's really where we want to get to. Now, they may still want to buy some of their own equipment for takeoff and landing location that only they have, right, like a ceilometer. But, if we can get everybody to share their data, you've got real data now coming in where you can improve cloud ceiling forecasts over an area to get a much better understanding. Today they don't know what they're going to fly in if they can't see it. There's no data. You don't know if it's IFR around that ridge. You don't know. So that means they have to stay grounded until they know and things like that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, can you share some, thoughts, observations, what it's like being an entrepreneur and building a, a weather business thoughts for aspiring founders in this industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you know, you guys got an idea of what it's like, because you've been asking me very good, challenging questions. And by the way, I do appreciate it, because, what we're really trying to do is very hard on a number of levels, right? You got the policy. Which I've worked on with FAA and ASTM to try to, you know, make it more favorable to bring in third party weather providers into the aviation industry. You've got the science and technology, which is all cutting edge. Everything we're doing is on the edge of technology and science. It hasn't been that this stuff hasn't existed before. It's been in the universities and labs a long time, but no one's ever pulled it together into a, you know, into a production system and make it into a business case that could work. And then you've got the culture in aviation, like, the questions you guys are asking. These are all good questions. They're all real problems. They're all real objections that I have to overcome. and that's hard. That takes a lot of energy, right? If I could have probably invented the pogo stick and it would have been a hell of a lot easier, right? But I like hard challenges because I've been in this industry so long, I've been fed up that we haven't been able to really change the aviation system, right? It's been the same system for years and it just doesn't make sense to me that we're kind of happy with it when it's so disruptive and costs so much. So, and then selling my investors. Right? So, this is not an easy sell. You have to find people that really get in and understand that it's really about the data. It's not about weather, right? It's about the data. It's about what the data can do. Why is it every other part of the industry says we need better data to make decisions, but weather, eh, we don't need better data. This will work fine. I mean, I just, it's so baffling to me. And I understand it. I think it's the culture. I think it's the way people have been brought up. I think it's just the system. And it's also, really difficult to understand what we're trying to do and understand why it will work. So I get all that. That's, what's been the hardest part. I mean, this, building the business, hard because you need money, hard because we need customers. What I am confident about right now is we will get them. So what's the second problem? The second problem is the pace by which this industry is actually growing. And I would tell people that are, trying to, build a business in this industry, not just weather, is you gotta have patience and you gotta have recognize it's never going to go as fast as you think it is. Don't dilute yourself thinking, that you're gonna, you know, do something different than everyone else, because you can't if the policy doesn't change, you can't if the FAA doesn't change the policy. And the other thing is these, all these other companies I work with, they're all doing new software too, which is what I love, by the way. And they all have their challenges. Like you said, Peter, they may not be ready to invest in weather, right? They may not be ready to invest in something else. So, I think, the key is, you have to know what you're getting into. You got to understand that it's a different animal. We're basically building an aircraft and flying at the same time in this industry writ large. It's not an established industry where you're trying to do something that's entrepreneurial and innovative, and it's challenging.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And as we wrap up, what's, one message that you would like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think, you know, again, I think this has been a great conversation.

It was good.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I hope it wasn't like that.

I do believe that what we're doing is the right thing I'm always more than happy to have more conversations about this. I want to you know, there's things I still have to learn There's people that probably can help me figure out how to crack the nut Right? So I don't want you to think that I have all the answers. what I'm just going to say though is weather imposes uncertainty. And uncertainty in anything costs money. And, the only way that you're going to resolve that is by having real data to fill in that uncertainty gap. And if the data can give you the ROI and you can demonstrate it, believe it. If I can show you this, believe it, right? The implementation part is hard because the companies we're working with have to bring their company along with this, right? Who, again, have a lot of people who would say, Oh, why are we doing this data? I get it from ForeFlight. I can see my weather, you know. So, this is a multi faceted problem, right? That's why you have to come in at the CFO level and in the COO and CEO level. Because, you really got to have a buy in by the company up and down to say, yeah, this is the direction we're going to go in because it makes sense. It's the future of weather. It's the future of, networked information and it's the future of analytics. So you want good weather data in there. Why are you going to spend a billion dollars on all these other systems that are going to give you perfect data and then you're going to use weather as your weakest link in the tent? It doesn't make sense to me. Why invest in all that if it's, this is your weakest link in your chain, right? So that's my takeaway.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we certainly enjoyed it as well, Don.

And inside that, we really said, where is our permission? Where can we move the needle? And we wanted to think big enough, but we wanted to think so big, it was ludicrous. And so in the space of full flight data and the space of maintenance records, we saw so many use cases that frankly got us very excited. When you contrast that to a technology company, who's looking at large addressable markets, they tend to look at retailers and banks and government agencies, and they get to our industry and we love our industry, but it's not the biggest industry. And so a company like Amazon, Microsoft, Google tends to not want to get down to that level of fidelity of what's aircraft data doing, what are these thousands of parameters I'm pulling from this aircraft, where they truly meet?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and a conversation with Andrew Coleman, the leader of GEs Aerospace' Software as a Service business. So this is another conversation with a more traditional Aviation business leader, like Uma, Paul, Eric, and Lorne and of course, previous guests who discuss the intersection of traditional aviation and advanced air mobility. This intersection is critical to understand for the viability of businesses on both ends of the aviation spectrum. The effective and smart use of data is heaven for us at The Vertical Space, so we were looking forward to our conversation with Andrew to hear how one of the capable blue bloods in aviation, GE mines, analyzes and provides data for meaningful use cases for their aviation customers. It's great to hear Andrew's comments, how airlines buy, who to target and the best way to approach and sell to airlines. This clearly applies to our advanced air mobility customers as well. We start with a discussion around the perception of the value of aviation data in the past 10 years or so. And how under Andrew's leadership GE has identified select areas to assist their core customers, commercial and business aviation. And towards the end of our discussion, you'll hear how some of the same value points may apply to advanced air mobility. You'll hear about what data is being always saved by aircraft, the original eventual use of that data. How it's analyzed and presented back to operators and their pilots, how it's evaluated and valued by airlines and business aviation and different use cases. With GE the use cases start with safety, but listen to how GE has taken that basic safety data and helped to shape and influence his airline sustainability and efficiency efforts, because this contributes to how airlines actually pay for the product. You may be a bit surprised that a company of the size success and prestige of GE is, as Andrew says, not starting with big, hairy, audacious goals, as it relates to addressing problems with data for airlines. But our targeting very specific use cases with well-defined data. Some may be disappointed in this non-sexy or loftier approach, but it's important for all to understand that such focus may be a good lesson for those trying to build a business in aviation. It's also no coincidence that some of the successful companies are those who have real value and applicability in both traditional and advanced aviation. So take it all in and we hope you enjoy our discussion with Andrew Coleman who demonstrates that success includes both people and profits as you innovate for today's and tomorrow's customers in The Vertical Space.

And yet when I look around the continuum of data we play in some cases. It's still viewed as paper, ironically, to be stored in a box somewhere in case a regulator needs it. To the other extreme, where data that maybe five years ago, 10 years ago, we thought, wow, there's a lot of value here, but there's no way we could get a regulator on board, or we could get a pilot's union comfortable with this. We've debunked that. And many of the use cases that people just said, no way, no how, and so I'm looking forward to unpacking that with you all, but in short, I just feel like this data asset that we've known is there for a long time, we're seeing a whole lot of value ranging from flight safety, something that's very top of mind for all of us right now, to sustainability to Asset Lifecycle Management, to even reliability, getting rid of that word delay and cancel when we go to the airport every day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Andrew, in some ways, if I am going to interpret your response properly, what you're saying is there's more value in the data than people realized. Is that right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Let me see if I can run across the continuum with you for a little bit. I'll start on the record side. Forever in a day, a typical aircraft will generate, believe it or not, about five to 30, 000 pieces of paper a year in the form of a maintenance record. We've all seen this when we're flying, sitting in the, in the Fuselage and then see the technician come on and the pilot's got to sign a couple pieces of paper before we take off. All that was historically thrown in a box somewhere and just kept in the unlikely event a regulator needed to see it, or we needed to pull it. And yet today, because we've digitized all those records and through the power of things like a large language model, we can start to glean a whole lot of insight about what's really going on with that aircraft. And oftentimes we can get rid of a cancel, we can get rid of a delay, we can prove airworthiness in a second. We can look at a bill of materials of what's inside of that airplane in real time. On the other end, forever and a day there was the view as snapshot. Think of it like an old school Polaroid of every flight was good enough. And yet, gosh, in the 60s, British Airways said, I think there's a whole lot more that can be done with this device, the Quick Access Recorder, grabbing a couple thousand parameters, and we today would say that what used to be the Polaroid of a flight, we're now getting a high definition movie of every flight, and when you get a high definition anything, I'll think about the first time I saw golf on television in high def versus the old school. I could see like dimples in the golf ball. I see the word Titleist. I could see the blades of grass and that definition. That's the kind of definition we can now see in a flight. And when you have that level of definition, you can get down to a runway with a certain weather condition. You can get down to a landing gear that we saw land hard three times today. You can get into an APU and potentially how it's being used at the gate or not being used at the gate. All that fidelity that I think maybe people gave up on is now there. And the third area that I point to is airspace. Something that forever in a day, when you look at over the course of a day, a week, a month, a year, all the approaches, all the takeoffs from an airfield, you can start to see a whole lot of inefficiency. And yet forever in a day, people said, oh, the regulators will never meet with us and actually look at how we can raise efficiency here. And I'm finding that myth is just that a myth. Whereas 10 years ago, it was hard. It did require a partnership between airlines and regulators. Today, people are showing a willingness. Let's go have that conversation. Let's go work on this together to not only make more efficiency coming in and out of airports, but frankly, reduce the carbon footprint around airports like we see this right now, we're being done at Kuala Lumpur.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, I like this description of this arc of digitization and, I wonder if we can spend a little bit more time on it. Because if I'm hearing you correctly, we as an industry have gone from having all these tens of thousands of pieces of paper that have been stored in multiple filing cabinets. And then you can probably describe the first attempt at digitization as merely scanning some of these and still having a quote, digital paper record, but not really having the full analytical power of this data. And so that if that's generation one of digitization, the second wave would probably be, making sense of it and doing some level of analytics. Are we still in that second phase? When did that start according to you? And what comes after?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think you nailed it, Luka. The first phase was how do I effectively create a Google search capability on my records? So instead of sending Luka or Andrew into the warehouse to look through boxes, I could just type into a search bar APU, Boeing, General Electric, whatever I wanted to pull up and then in a nanosecond basically get that record or that series of records. Step two then was we started looking at use cases. What kind of things occur today that are fairly manual and onerous that tomorrow could be fairly automated? And one of the first use cases we landed on was as more and more aircraft are not owned by an airline but owned by a lessor, just like when we lease a car, that lease comes to an end. And our industry, as we know, to transition from owner A to owner B and have the intermediary of the lessor, we've got to prove that aircraft is taken care of and it's airworthy. And so we work with the records and we work with both the airline and the lessor, and in many cases, the MRO, to do that very thing, to prove airworthiness so that we could take the aircraft from operator A over to operator B. And what was taking about nine months, believe it or not a quote from one of our customers was it now takes nine seconds. It's a workflow that's automated, and it was at nine seconds, but as you can imagine, it's a whole lot faster now, proving, yep, that aircraft is well taken care of. Here's all the records. It's ready to go. Operator B, take it, fly it. You're good.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you think comes next? And if this is now a digital repository of things where you can browse maintenance logs and prove the airworthiness of an aircraft. That still seems like a very rudimentary use of data. What's on the horizon? what are you excited about in terms of the next wave of digital?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Two things, Luka. Thanks to the power of optical character recognition, we're doing a lot of work with Microsoft. They've really invested here. We can take text, handwritten text that's in Mandarin. Handwritten text that's in German, handwritten text that's in English, as well as all the stuff in the quote unquote PDF. And we can start to look for things like, how does that match what's in the log page from the captain and the first officer? And then when that aircraft is reporting a problem, how could I quickly not three weeks later, but say three minutes later, get to a root cause of what the problem is based on all this new data I have available to me that before wasn't available to me. And so it's a pretty easy leap to say, all right, large language models were built with making sense out of text in mind. And again, when you start doing the math of how many aircraft are flying and each one of these aircrafts are generating anywhere from five to 30, 000 pieces of paper per year, we've got a lot of data to train these models very rapidly to start looking at when Andrew, me, I'm put in charge of air conditioning. Oh my gosh. When his fix goes back into production, you may want to double check it. When Luka's in charge of it, that thing's good to go and we never have a problem again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Could we just step back a little bit and GE has been involved with digital for a number of years, and there's been a lot of talk around the internet of things, many years ago, define digital aviation for us, Andrew, and from the big picture, what are the big hairy problems that digital aviation can address and which ones are they addressing today, just to give a good perspective to our listeners?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so in the ecosystem of aerospace, we've channeled our energy first to operators, next to lessors and third to MROs. And inside that, to your point, we really said, where is our permission? Where can we move the needle? And we wanted to think big enough, but we wanted to think so big, it was ludicrous. And so in the space of full flight data and the space of maintenance records, we saw so many use cases that frankly got us very excited. When you contrast that to a technology company, who's looking at large addressable markets, they tend to look at retailers and banks and government agencies, and they get to our industry and we love our industry, but it's not the biggest industry. And so a company like Amazon, Microsoft, Google tends to not want to get down to that level of fidelity of what's aircraft data doing, what are these thousands of parameters I'm pulling from this aircraft, where they truly meet? And so back to your question. One of my favorite things of our job is GE gives me full permission every day to help every one of our customers with the fleet they have today, operate it far more safely. Our number one use case is actually working with teams around the world called the FOQA team, the Flight Operations Quality Assurance Team. Today, 55 percent of the commercial fleet is trusting us to decode full flight data and help them find patterns, events, things that would lead to potential risks that doesn't need to exist in our aviation ecosystem. And that's far and away our number one use case. And again, the thing I love GE lets me do on our team is this isn't just for customers that bought a GE engine. Or customers just with a Boeing aircraft, it's no matter what fleet they have, we're going to serve them exactly with that fleet. So we're trusted with every airframe engine combination you can think of. The bigger GE bet is by serving customers every day, over time, when it is time to acquire more, customers like the people that are there every day, helping them with their problems versus customers that show up every three to five years for the big campaign or talk about the new cool technology inside of our engine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you mentioned the use case, you mentioned FOQA. How is that a use case more than it is a dataset that's being used traditionally for safety purposes, but what's the use case that the FOQA data is being used for today? And what problems is it solving for an airline?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So today we've, harnessed, worked about 55, 000 years of flight data. Every one of those flights we're analyzing through a series of events. I'll give a couple of basic ones. Unstable approach rapid taxi, runway exceedance. And so in each and every one of these flights, we're looking for any of the parameters we set up and these parameters evolve over time to be violated or miss, triggering a warning that we would then share with our customer. Hey, at this approach, at this time of day, with this kind of weather, we see a lot of crabbing of the aircraft coming in, a lot of unstable approaches. At this approach, we see a high risk of runway exceedance. With this aircraft, we're seeing this kind of risk in this kind of condition. Each airline that we can think of with any measurable size of tail. So I'd say over 10 tails today, and I'll make it very U. S. specific, has an apartment that in many ways looks like a group of actuaries at an insurance company. They're just looking at all these reams of data, trying to find needles, if you will, in the haystack. Of data patterns, things that would indicate, wow, we've got a potential unknown risk that because of this exceedance, because of this miss in this event, we need to change the way we do our training. We need to change the way we operate this aircraft. We'd change our standard operating procedure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you're taking the FOQA data. Historically, I know once the aircraft lands, they take the FOQA data and they try to process it, they try to find the relevant information. Is this something you're doing post flight? Are you extracting it in real time during the flight? And then number two how is that information going back to to the dispatcher. How is it going back to the air traffic coordinator? How is it going back to the pilot? In what form are they receiving the information so they can do something different?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So to work through your question, great question, where a wireless quick access recorder, you know, you call it a QAR, exists, we can get the data into the hands of whomever needs it 10 so it's not real time, but it's not really far off from real time, because a lot of aircraft still have a quick access recorder that requires a technician to actually go with a stick to the aircraft and pull the data. In some cases, we'll have that data a day, two days, three days, five days out. And so there's a range from, I'd say 10 minutes to about five days is what we typically see in the range of how often this data is being harnessed. To your point, where we've really seen the power is not just having this data sit inside of the FOQA department for them to analyze and share with the chief pilot or share with the head of flight ops, but it's to close that loop and put it in the hands of the actual pilot. So in 2017, Qantas had the bold vision, hey, let's go put this data right in the electronic flight bag. So that our pilots can see both post flight, how did I do across the series of safety dimensions, but now pre flight, based on my track record flying this mission, what are things I ought to be aware of? What are things our fleet's seen? What are things I've seen to really prepare for each and every mission based on a series of historical data? One of the powers we've then been able to tap into is every pilot that we work with tends to be very type A, very driven, and very serious about their profession. And so when they start to see not only how have I done over a series of time, but we layer on top in a de identified way, how all other pilots completing the same mission have performed. It drives interesting behavior characteristics where I want to be the best, and if I'm finding when I land at Hartsfield Jackson Airport, I'm coming in more unstable than others, it may lead to some time in the sim. It may lead into this questioning how I approach that airport in the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Andrew I think a part of your response, you were alluding to the things that Flight Pulse offers to the pilots on the dedicated app and I've taken a look because it, it sounded interesting and to your point, people can compare in a, post flight debrief type of scenario, how much fuel they used in landing, how much time to spend taxing in with an engine off what the touchdown distance was the pitch rates at takeoff, et cetera, et cetera. And so I can see the gamification aspect of it and how that would be engaging for a type A personality. But when you sell a piece of software like that to airlines, how does that customer quantify the value? How do they see and how do they realize that particular value.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would say for 9 out of 10 customers, it's just a commitment to continuing to raise the bar in flight safety and not having to put an ROI, just knowing by the amount of events we've seen and the reduction in events that this was raising the bar in flight safety is good enough. However, I will say, we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm from Qantas, this was actually in their sustainability report, but also from a lot of our European customers, saying, I'd also like to use the capability and the power of the tool to lower my carbon footprint. And so we've built a series of dimensions in Flight Pulse to help a pilot see where carbon is created and opportunities they have throughout the mission to lower their carbon footprint. And so by giving a sustainability score at the end of every mission and then seeing that across 10, 15, 25 dimensions, however many the operator wants to show, we're also seeing CO2 reduction, which is a good thing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And how can these improvements in metrics, whether this is in sustainability or safety, how can that be clearly attributed to an app like that, as opposed to, a dozen other initiatives that an airline might have?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what we're finding is I'll lean on research that came out actually from BYU about what a pedometer does. The second you put one of these things on your hands, whether it's an Apple watch or a Fitbit, science says you take about 500 more steps a day. Just having that visual reminder of how you did with real data. What we're finding with Flight Pulse is the same thing, by providing highly accurate personalized data in a very near real time way, because we think it's very important for pilots to see this within a week, not two months after I completed the mission. Here's how you did. And here's some of the things you could have done better. We do see pilots over time choosing to improve the way I taxi. A real basic example, performing a single engine taxi when appropriate. One of the powers of this high fidelity data is let's say there was a lot of rain on the taxi approach. That was not a safe time for a single engine taxi to occur. And so in that case, we're not going to punish the pilot for a bad sustainability score because they would have risked safety in doing so. And so that's the level of intelligence we put into the software.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are you sure that the data you're measuring can be connected directly to the overall end safety outcomes? If you measure a certain piece of data, and especially if you gamify it, isn't there a risk that pilots are going to fixate on maximizing performance against that data measure, but through that fixation, isn't there a risk that they're diverting their attention away from other aspects of the taxiing or the approach that might actually move you further away from ultimate safety? How do you know that you're measuring the right thing and that you're encouraging the right behavior?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We're up to about 30, 000 pilots using this technology now, so our sample size is getting pretty meaningful. And to your point, there was a season in our industry many decades ago where compensation was tied to fuel savings. We've intentionally done none of that in this work. And again, the decision tree is always safety events override any sustainability events. But as I shared, in our 30, 000 pilot sample size, I've not personally seen every one of these, but I've yet to see an example where that was risked or put in jeopardy. I feel like just the pilots we work with understand safety comes paramount to any kind of sustainability savings. And on the back end, I've not come across an airline yet that's saying, you've got to lower your carbon footprint at all costs. Every airline we work with is abundantly clear safety first.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The 30, 000 pilots.

And it's presented back to the pilots in some delayed form, a week, perhaps longer, in some de identified way, and in order to be able to help them fly a safer route. Is that largely the value proposition?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In their case as with about half the operators, they've been trusting us to do this for 5, 10, 15, 20 years already.

Scott's going to say, well, that sounds interesting. I would assume a CEO is going to very quickly say, what's the return on investment for me? And sometimes safety's a tough sell. Before we move off the opportunities that would come beyond the FOQA data on the airplane, what's the pitch for justifying the expense, Andrew? And give us any numbers on, what's the quantifiable value, tough to quantify safety, and then what's the dollar amounts these guys are potentially paying, and what objections would you get from a CEO of a major airline to this kind of capability? Right. So the beauty is you get a 3\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>for one special with this data. It does start with the FOQA team and the flight safety department. It then quickly plays into as more and more airlines really care about how I get to net zero and not just talk about it or do marketing around it. It does start to play a role one to two percent of your carbon emissions can be reduced when you apply this technology. We've seen that. Qantas has been very vocal as an example in their sustainability report. So this isn't magical make believe numbers. They're real numbers we've seen. We then take this same data, because it's such high fidelity data about every flight, and help the tech ops team gain a lot of clues about what's going on with their aircraft. So all of a sudden I can start to predict failures. In many cases, before they occur. Failure is as basic as the example I used before. I saw three hard landings this week. Probably time to check the landing gear. Things around pneumatics, hydraulics, air conditioning, APU. Just all the things that drive us as passengers nuts. All these things are being performed with the same data set. So you get a three for one. On the case of price point with pilots, so I won't get precise, it's less than Netflix per month per pilot. So it's a very affordable price point.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>27:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How much of the data that's being thrown off by the airplane? And I think you guys said by 2030 there could be six million terabytes of data that are being generated, how much of that data is coming in the form of the FOQA data? And then if it's not via FOQA, how else is it being generated by the aircraft? What other data is being generated above and beyond the FOQA data?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>27:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So your typical flight data recorder today, you're talking about tens of thousands of attributes. One of the challenges we have, we're starting to talk about the Internet of Things and the quote unquote edge, is the amount of time the aircraft's actually on the ground. And you start talking about downloading the terabytes you could download, just bandwidth is nowhere near there in that near real time fashion, so using a wireless recorder. It's absolutely there if you want to go take the technician and download the data that way. And so we have to be, part of our secret sauce, if you will, is to be very thoughtful about the couple thousand attributes we know Flight Ops and Tech Ops are going to badly want, we know is going to help the operator really understand the safety, the reliability of the aircraft. And so again, because we've been at this for a while, we know what attributes tend to lead to good prediction and good outcome and what attributes we leave alone. And then to your point, when do we go get those at another point in time or include those in another environment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, what exactly is the data that we've been talking about?

This is our customer's data, not our data. And so it's the operator, it's if the lesser owns the asset, it would be the lessor's data? but it's not our data. Again, we earn the right to work on it each and every day. And so this data Is the diagnostics, the health of the aircraft. One of the use cases that we are really proud to power is GE and CFM currently have 44, 000 engines flying all over the world each and every day. And so we provide as a service back to GE and CFM the ability to decode all of their engine data from the same spot, flight data, recorder. And then as a result, when we've got potentially an aircraft with a problem, we can quickly get to root cause on say a fuel nozzle and what's going on for that particular aircraft and that particular engine versus having to say, Oh my gosh, we've got a systemic problem across the entire system, across all of our engines. That power to get to root cause really quick. Our customers appreciate it. It keeps aircraft flying and allows us to keep our fleets of engines as reliable as possible. Well, also on the backend planning for maintenance. When we see things starting to wear down beyond cycles, we're able to plan for, all right, the shop visit, you're going to need these materials there in time. So the engine's not just waiting in the parking lot for all the materials to show up to be fixed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is that engine data, Andrew, traditionally within FOQA data, or are you getting data, because you're the manufacturer, are you getting data above and beyond what would be traditionally in FOQA data?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Historically the engine business prior to us and the advent of our digital business would just use ACARS snapshot data.

Where do you see the opportunity is for large established incumbent organizations like yours, as opposed to, young, nimble, very tech savvy innovative startups.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Love that question. Let me hit it from a couple fronts. My background was about 20 years in the tech industry before the last eight years here at GE. And I honestly, when I started here eight years ago, did not appreciate the amount of depth you need to have to understand how an airplane works. And while there are a lot of brilliant data scientists in Silicon Valley and Austin, Texas, where I live and other places like that, all the physics of an aircraft married with this data science slash digital and now AI knowledge is a real powerful edge. And so the profile we look for actually, when we hire and interview engineers, is about 80 percent of their strength comes from depth in our industry and 20 percent depth in technology and depth in emerging technology. Because we find the technology is getting easier and easier to work with, requiring less and less domain knowledge, whereas our industry just begs of that deep domain knowledge. To your question though emerging use case that's been very exciting for me to be a part of is a couple years ago we joined the Digital Alliance. Airbus took to market a platform called Skywise, where they made a very large bet saying we're going to make it very easy for our operators to have a single place to store data about their aircraft. And by the way, much like our stance, they're aircraft very agnostic. Whatever their fleet is, Skywise is ready to accommodate it. They then approached us and said, we feel like there's a domain knowledge you GE have about how aircraft work. And we also think there's a domain knowledge you Delta have about how a world class operator runs an airline with, probably the best completion factors on the planet. And so while never easy to get three companies of this size together, we did work through all the things that needed to happen to form not only a charter, but an alliance, and now we have 10 customers live benefiting from our predictive maintenance alerts. And so in many ways, while it would be maybe unthinkable for these size companies that nimble and fast and agile. We're actually doing that every day and customers like SAS, customers like EasyJet, customers like Allegiant have been very vocal about what it's meaning to their aircraft reliability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, there's two questions I want to ask. One is, what's the alternative? If you were speaking to the CEO of United Airlines, and I'm not sure if they're customers of the product, what will they be doing alternatively if they're not using your product?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More often than not, I would say it's what we started the podcast with Is just accepting the status quo and letting this data live in a department for a specific use case, not get into the hands, in the case of the pilots, the people that could really move the needle and impact the results in each and every flight. What we've found is the paradigm used to be you'd find an event in the FOQA department, you'd go to the chief pilot, and then over time it may make its way down to the line pilot. We flipped that model on its head because now pilots pre and post every flight are getting direct feedback on how I'm doing. And often times they're now going to their chief pilot, hey, this is what I've seen. My neighbor actually flies the A320 for Delta and he pulls me aside all the time. Hey, here's what I'm seeing and here's what I showed my first officer on my last mission, what we can do better. We're really excited about just changing this paradigm of an insight being lock baby in a department or just shared at the highest levels. Now it's at the front line with the people that can really move the needle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you, Andrew. Is there ever a gestalt here? Because you're working with 10 percent of the pilots, for example, and you're pulling all the data. I know you don't own it. But is there ever a greater value of working with the number of pilots you're working with? Can you aggregate it beyond the operator itself? And is there any insight that comes from the value of working with somebody one time, or are you just literally analyze the data from that one operator and the conclusions come from the operator, or are there any other greater conclusions because you're working with, arguably dozens of other operators. Can you use the data to bring about greater conclusions?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So because our industry has declared safety is just not an area we compete, we actually have user groups. I'm headed to Dubai in two weeks for our European Middle East one, have one later this year here in the Americas. Where we get together and do that very thing in a very informal way, but United to your example, we'll get up and show, here's what we learned this year. We want you all to understand and benefit from this, so our industry is safer. Beyond that the FAA has been a longtime customer of ours through the ASIAS program, which was created, gosh, over a decade ago to start sharing this data across operators so we could learn from each other. And so credit to the FAA to have this vision many years ago. We serve as the technology backbone for this, but they were the ones that said there's just benefit in bringing together all the data of our airspace, of our industry, and starting to find patterns beyond a single operator.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew can you tell a few stories from how the MROs are using data and how they're leveraging data to improve their operations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. And so, historically, an MRO would have a series of steps from induction to post inspection returning that asset, whether it be an engine, an aircraft, into the field. And yet, unfortunately, what we found, unlike a order you would place on FedEx or Amazon, where you could track every step of the visit, and you could pull at any point in time records for the parts being applied to this was done in a very ad hoc manual or paper based way. And so as a customer of the MRO, I had very little visibility into what was going on in my shop visit. It was more done with phone calls, or an email every once in a while, or a quick audit as to where things were. Now, just like the Pizza Tracker, just like the FedEx Tracker, I can go in Delta Tech Ops is one of our customers of this technology, and see at any point in the shop visit what's going on, what's been changed I can see a record to that, and I can see exactly when I'm going to get my aircraft, my engine back. And so again, it's just a level of visibility that didn't exist before. The ultimate use case or ROI point would be turnaround time. Instead of waiting and hoping and wondering when I'm going to get through, I see that turnaround time get fidelity and that turnaround time be honored.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Have there been any notable success stories or use cases where the value has been financially so massive and significant. Implicit in my question is an observation that we have been hearing about digitizing aviation and mining data for, a number of years. And yet it feels like it hasn't lived up to its promise yet. And I'd like to dissect this phenomena. Is it because of the difficulty in, grabbing, processing data? Negotiating data rights? Is it about somehow feedbacking that back into existing workflows. Is it about the rest of the ecosystem that might not be ready? Give us some more granular insight into why this aspect of technology and aviation hasn't really accelerated in the way that everybody hoped.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Luka, I think you nailed it. All of the above of what you just said, and I will point to a recent event that is a very unfortunate one, but it's forcing some very fortunate change. And that's the AOG Technics event, where there was a very bad actor putting bad parts into the aviation ecosystem. One of our customers, when that challenge confronted them, because they had gone through the process of digitizing all their records, and making them incredibly easy to retrieve, Within 60 seconds, they knew across their entire MRO network where their vulnerabilities were, and they were able to get the bad parts out of the system. When you contrast that, others that had not gone to that step, in some cases it took months and potentially just over provisioning, taking good parts out to be safe and be conservative. And so that event, while unfortunate, really did quickly prove digitized maintenance records.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>39:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm going to, I want to step back and we're talking to the CEO of a major airline and you gave them the value proposition, largely safety based.

And, we just had Lorne Cass on And he talked about choke points. He talked about, at the end of the day, in the United States, it comes down to New York and we want to be able to find ways to be able to improve the throughput of aircraft, let's say, in New York. Is there any possibility that you take the data that you have and you and in addition to being presented to the pilots via the EFB and the like, are there any other opportunities for operational improvements by using the data for other systems that are being used by the airline?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All the time. And so the airspace one is one we're very passionate about for some time now. We have had the Naverus business as part of our business, which goes way, way back looking at very efficient ways, not only to operate airspace, but to land in places that were historically very difficult or challenging to land. A lot of work many years ago with AirAsia allowed us to make the KOL or KL Kuala Lumpur Airport much more efficient, getting aircraft in and out more rapidly, but also cutting on the CO2 footprint. When you look at that airport, we tend to target a 90 percent efficiency rate. And I think not that long ago it was at 60, 63, something like that. That thinking we're applying to the state of Florida right now. We see some more challenge to what you mentioned in New York at many of the airports in Florida. We see some other airports here in the United States where there's an opportunity. actually just had a meeting this morning with a big operator in the Philippines and just seeing with the I believe it's 33 airports they have across all those islands, the tremendous amount of inefficiency that exists today and an opportunity to make that better.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And is that through this product, Andrew, or is it a different product?

It's called Airspace Insights It's interesting that you mentioned that at the end of the day, it's flight ops, it's tech ops that are paying for it through operational improvements, because that's how they have to pay for it. It's difficult to justify payments for safety only.

Progressive maintenance departments are dying to get their hands on this data to do a lot more work around fleet reliability. And so our more progressive operators have rolled up their sleeves and trained their teams on how to use this because it's a relational database. It was built with a belief you have to be fairly technical and know how to write standard query language, SQL, to retrieve data. Thanks to the power of what we're now seeing through our partnership with Microsoft, I see very quickly the ability, just like you ask Alexa at home, tell me the weather for me to tell our EMS environment, our measurement system, tell me about the last 10 flights into Jackson with A320s where we saw an unstable approach. And just that easy. Verbally say it. We just have to know how to write all that language and pull that data out. We think when that becomes reality, the amount of users in this environment goes from, our typical customer will see anywhere from 10 to 150 users, to potentially 300, 400 users. And not only those 400 users, but that data making its way to the head of flight ops, head of tech ops every day.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's FAA's perspective on the use of some of these AI tools, LLMs and other methods in touching, data that ultimately has real safety implications.

I think it'd be easy to say, slow down, let's lock it down and be very conservative. Part of that is the track record we've built. Being at this for over 20 years, there's a lot of credibility that comes with. We've not had, knock on wood, the big events you read about, newspapers, of data breaches, of lack of privacy, lack of security. We never take that for granted. However, because we've earned that permission, we find the FAA saying, we trust you, GE. You're not going to, in the software vernacular, fake it till you make it. When you bring us something, you're going to harden this, you're going to make sure it works, and it brings real value. But as you do, we're ready.

Let's say you're 20 times the size you are 10 years from now.

We really like without overhyping it, the eVTOL space, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity first to make sure that mode of transportation is very safe, but also over time they're going to need the same data to make sure that these aircraft are reliable and able to be dispatched the way they're being sold. And ubiquitous, almost like an Uber. We like the role we get to play in sustainability. We think we are sitting on just so many clues today: how to help an airline lower their carbon footprint, not a hundred percent, but gosh, if we can knock down one, two, three, four, 5 percent of the carbon created in this industry, that's a pretty big move in the right direction. We also like, frankly, the opportunity we see in the military side, something that's very early on, but we see a tremendous amount of opportunity for an aircraft to land. And let's just say within 15 minutes, the technician knows exactly what I need to fix on that aircraft for the next mission, not let me go look at a bunch of logs and diagnostics and then call the supplier and order some parts, and maybe it'll be ready next week.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You would think that maintenance piece would have a terrific return on investment as long as they're doing something different than they would otherwise do today. You would think that would have a good ROI. And let's talk a little bit about the eVTOL. Who is the customer? Is it the OEM? Is it the operator?

We're working with all the players you would expect. And a lot of them early on are asking the question, do we want to build this capability ourself, or do we want to lean on a GE who's done this in commercial aviation for quite a while, to be our partner? And we're finding about 80 percent want to lean on a trusted brand like a GE in the history we have, versus do it themselves. There's still a lot of smart technology people at these eVTOLs that want to do it themselves.

And while oftentimes it's hard to track the quote unquote value of safety, what we can show with a business jet is from the day they start with us to five years later, on average, 80 percent of their safety events are reduced. And so let's say in year one we see, I'll make this number up, 50 safety events, by year five we'll see 10. Just by again, harnessing this data, putting it back in the hands of a pilot to show when you fly into Teterboro, here's what we see going on these missions. And so I take that over to the eVTOL space, again I feel like, a critical point in adoption is going to be as a passenger knowing I'm getting on to something as safe as, or safer, than my car, my bus, my boat, any other mode of transportation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, in order to fully exploit data for better maintenance, whether this is better visibility, or more predictive and proactive maintenance, or, anything else for that matter, but what's the impact on, or disruption on the existing practices, on the existing processes, workforce, logistics, warehousing. In order for this technology to really reach its potential, it obviously cannot be done in isolation, so what's the impact of the larger ecosystem and how quickly do you think it can move to, to embrace this promise?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So ironically, a lot of the impact isn't for the future aircraft coming, although we're very excited about that. It's the reality, given all the challenges we know about, and I place an order for an aircraft today, it's a commercial example, I'm 20 30 something before I can take delivery. And so accepting that reality, I've got to take the aircraft I have and make sure they're flying longer than maybe I anticipated. And in doing that, it's begging of us. How do we find more and more clues to help through a summer schedule where I thought it was going to have brand new A320s and I'm actually going to fly a legacy model for a couple more years? And so we actually like this challenge a lot. How do we keep the fleets our customers have today knowing the life is going to be extended on them in the air longer? Doing a lot of projects right now with customers you would imagine even heading into this summer, knowing the fleets a little older was anticipated to be refreshed a little faster. How do we keep these fleets as reliable as possible as we see just unbelievable demand heading into the summer?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When we talked to Lorne Cass, former VP of the Integrated Operations Center of American, and we said, what's the greatest operational challenge you have to address? It was predictability. He needs to be able to better predict what's going to happen. And there's all kinds of things he can do with better predictability. The second one is just real time. What's going on. So Lorne, going back to that discussion said, surveillance is really important. I need to know where the planes are for a variety of reasons. The third element is. we'll call it, there's a POET tool out there, what is it? Post Operations Evaluation Tool, so POET. And people have said, listen, there's all kinds of value of historical post operations information in order to be able to better plan the operation in the future. How do you think an airline sizes up the value of those three elements. And where are you within, I assume you fall into the poet component to it, but how do you think they size up the value of the three? And do you see yourself moving into any one of the other two buckets?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the predictability one, we feel like we jumped in head first with our Digital Alliance. With Airbus and Delta for what you just described. And I'll quote David Thompson from Delta Tech Ops. I need to know, and I thought this was really profound. I need to know yesterday what I need to run my airline today. Not six months ago, because then I'll overstock and just do a lot of crazy things, but also not in real time. Oh my gosh, this part's falling apart. This problem's arising. I need to know yesterday what I'm going to do with my airline today. And so that was the problem. We've really been hovering around for the predictive maintenance work we're doing with the Alliance. But absolutely, to your point, while we live in that third leg of the stool today, we're going to absolutely need to live across all three if we're going to be the trusted holistic provider we're aiming to be and frankly, keep the seat we've been honored with. I think if we just stay in the last one, we're probably relegated at some point.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now let's, you know, for our listeners who have technology that may apply to advanced air mobility, it may apply to the airline. What advice would you give to our innovators on the podcast who have an interesting technology they think would apply to the airline, but they've never sold to an airline before. What advice would you give them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As much as you're taught to have a BHAG and to think gigantic, I would think small to go big. We tend to, in our world, think about a problem for I'll point to Qantas. They were very passionate putting data in the hands of pilots is going to help us raise flight safety. We had a strong hunch there was repeatability, but instead of day one, let's go sign up 50 operators and really go at it. We really stayed in stealth for about 24 months to make sure that thesis was true and to make sure we run the trust, not only of pilots, but also the pilots union and the leadership of Qantas. So what we were doing was good for the airline and not creating an environment where we saw unintended consequence or people trying to win on one metric to advance another metric. That's tough if you're in a VC world where you're asking for money from investors. But as you know, you've worked in this industry for a long time as well. The amount of credibility that is given to, you really move the needle at a Quantis, honestly and I don't want to diminish our sales team because I think the world of them, they do so much selling on our behalf post that experiment that I don't know that had we rushed to market and tried to go solve this for 50 airlines at once, we'd sit here today with 30, 000 pilots. As we talked about earlier, the addressable market in this industry is not as big as banking or telco or government or retail. And so that's why you don't see a lot of tech startups go pure play into the aviation space. We had the benefit because of who we are, GE Aerospace. This is the industry we care about. And so with that, I get a lot of freedom to just focus on this industry versus Andrew, could you be a transportation business and go help boats and help cars and help trucks and other things that move. Nope. We help the aviation industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew talking about other players who are in this space, do you know how active Palantir is in this area? And the reason I'm saying this is obviously their mission statement is to, and I'm paraphrasing here, but enabling better decision making by, analyzing data They've been very successful serving the government customers in this and increasingly so, corporates. And there have been initiatives between Palantir and Airbus with Skywise a number of years ago, but I haven't heard any PR or any good case studies coming out of Palantir that are discussing this problem and said, unless I missed it how active are they and how do you make sense of either outcome of this question?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yep, I was actually at their offices a couple weeks ago. We hosted our board meeting for the Digital Alliance at the Palantir office in New York and to your point they are the technology backbone for the Skywise platform the platform We're building all of our predictive maintenance capability against. So we've gotten to know them very well, and being very direct, one of the decisions we've all made is, we have deep domain knowledge in how aircraft work, and the problems of our industry, whereas Palantir has deep domain knowledge on how to build a platform that ingests data from a lot of different places using a framework, they'll talk about it as their data ontology, making it very easy to not only build that environment once, but keep that environment current and bring new data sources in. And so we feel like we're getting the best of all worlds the intellectual property, the thinking, the depth of a Palantir on the platform, married with our depth on the industry, our customers and the problems they care about. So very familiar and very integrated with the work of Palantir.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How quickly do you think a third party can get up the learning curve on that domain knowledge? And again, I'm thinking of Palantir and how they started with no pedigree of DoD, it was a startup, but they quickly got up that learning curve. And arguably, somebody like them could probably do the same for aviation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. We take it very serious and we're very humbled to that and very paranoid to that. But also as I've gone through growing, scaling, and hiring our business, as I shared before, the depth of knowing how aircraft works, and not just looking at parameters coming off of an airplane, I can't emphasize enough how much that served us in serving our customers. Early on, we did experiment with just pure data scientists that didn't know how the industry worked. And in many cases, it was just a bridge too far. Some cases they were nimble enough. They did learn the industry. And I'd say that about tech companies we do see. But it's not as easy as you would think.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I would assume when you're talking about managing FOQA data, having a trusted partner like GE who knows aviation would be a big deal. Now, if Palantir could augment what you're doing, all the better, but being GE I would think would be a big advantage.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And we see the same, I'll put it on plug for Microsoft, see the same thing with Microsoft. While they know optical character recognition incredibly well, they don't pretend to know what kind of things we're actually looking for, from a maintenance record. And so that's where we come together. We say, here's what we're trying to do. Can you unleash your brilliant engineers to help us do it a lot faster with a lot more languages? So we're finding the tech companies want to build platforms that scale across all industries, and then putting that domain knowledge of the industry on top is something we're enjoying doing, Airbus is enjoying doing, but we don't see a lot of tech companies wanting to go all the way to that end.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, are you exploring any use cases in the unmanned aviation domain and autonomy and perhaps leveraging data to inform the development arc of autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The short answer is yes. It's another reason we like the eVTOL space a lot because of the things they're trying to do over time without getting too precise. Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can you get more precise? Now this is interesting. So, let's say, Wisk from Boeing brings about, from Boeing, brings about an autonomous vehicle in the next five, ten years. How much of their bringing about that unmanned eVTOL will GE be a part of, and why?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's really OEM to OEM in this space. Some of them are asking, GE, we want you here every day. Help us with all of this. Some without naming any are saying, we got this. We don't need any help from anybody. We just want to do this all on our own because we think it's so unique, proprietary to our business model. I'm headed over to Europe this weekend to meet with one of the eVTOL companies early next week. That's been very much of the GE come in here and help us with all you got. But there's others that have said, nope, GE, we've got this. Thanks, but no thanks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How much smarter has your capability become? I loved your answer, by the way, to the, our innovators on the line of, how to approach the market. Go with one really deep and prove the value. Boy, if everybody could listen to that's great advice. But let's say you, you developed a capability with your product through Qantas. How much smarter did it become because now you worked with 20 other airlines? Or was the value proposition more or less the same as you went to each incremental airline?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The value proposition was effectively the same, but to your point, the argument could be, well, Qantas helped fund a lot of the innovation. What's unique about Qantas, and you guys know this, is they're incredibly proud of their safety record and what they've done to make our industry safer and safer. So in this case, frankly, it wasn't a concern of theirs. The other trade off is in tech speak, when you're an early adopter or part of private preview, so before a product is generally available you tend to get the best, the deepest, the richest engineering team possible because we want to get it right. And so the benefit they gain is they're getting our best, brightest, deepest, and get to drive a lot of the requirements for the product versus if you're in more of the mainstream or late adopters. You're getting something that's hardened that works great, but you're not able to influence the roadmap nearly as much.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Andrew, what's the most common criticism that you have received? One that is maybe, the fairest as it relates to your efforts around data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most common, and I thank GE for letting me be this proactive, is whose data is it? And very early on, we landed on, this is not our data. We are in the right to work on it each and every day. The second common criticism I get a lot is, why should I trust an OEM with all of my fleet data, not just their engines. And again, from day one, this data is our customer's data. This data is not shared in a secret way with our engine team. So we can see how the other engines are working, this sort of thing. And never for a second have we violated that and we never will. And so those tend to be the two biggest objections. And again, I'm just really proud of working for a company that said no, just serve the customer with the fleet they have and the tools you have to the best of your ability every day. And by demonstrating that over time, when it's time to grow and add, I think it puts us in a pretty unique place.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What innovations are on the critical path to making digital aviation, live up to its fullest potential. You mentioned better connectivity. What else?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I want data faster. I would like to widen the aperture to get more attributes off of the flight data recorder, because I think as more and more of these attributes are becoming available, while we may not find these things, I do believe in the power of artificial intelligence. The I believe with time, we'll be able to glean a whole lot more insights than we have historically. And so to me, it's getting the pipe bigger, making the latency lower, and then really leaning into our relationship at Microsoft as an example, and the work they're doing with not just occupational character recognition, OCR, but also AI.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When startups reach out to you for partnerships or, other commercial agreements, what are those conversations typically look like? What would you call out as, good or bad strategies?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We love working with startups, and I frankly spend a lot of my time working with emerging technology and four or five people with a really good idea. Where we tend to have a very grounded conversation is early on, they want us to put a GE logo on it, which implies a level of quality we're really proud of, and take it to every airline around the world. Back to our use case, our example before, we try to start with one customer. And one very discreet problem before we go promise or tell the world, Oh my gosh, look how neat this technology is, or overhype something. And so again, in the tech speak, we're probably too conservative. We're not hyping it enough. We're not faking it till we make it, but that's something we're proud of. And so that's the number one thing when we see a neat idea come our way is if there's a true interest to channel the use case to a single operator. Knowing there'll be repeatability down the line, we'll go for it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Excellent. And just to close it out, what's one point that you'd like to leave our audience with?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the biggest point I'd love to leave our audience is so many people join our industry with the passion for I want to be a pilot, and I love and respect pilots a tremendous amount. And then they get into a Embry Riddle or University of North Dakota, to universities that actually have our technology, not only to monitor their fleets, but teaching classes on it. And they start to fall in love with the data and analytical side of our industry and feel like they're at this crossroads. Do I want to go work in the digital world or do I want to go be a pilot or be a technician? And I think that decision doesn't have to be so acute anymore. I believe you can have an incredible career working in our industry, but working with the data, the insights that are just now starting to make themselves available. And so I would tell our audience, no matter where you are in your career, if this is something that raises your interest and raises your curiosity, give it a shot. I am surrounded by a team of wingmates that just feel like we have found our calling on this earth and I don't care what industry you're in, when you're that passionate about what you do and you see directly every plane I know that I see going over my home, more often than not, it's one of our customers and I take a level of pride knowing that landing's going to be a little safer and those passengers are going to get to where they're supposed to a little more reliably and we're having a hand in that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's great, Andrew.

Can you imagine the airline industry, if everybody was separating themselves, and the only way that they would, change the track as if they got a TCAS warning that says turn right and descend immediately. Same thing in the drone community. Wouldn't be very efficient if you were operating, let's say, drone delivery service and didn't know that somebody else was out there and you're altering your course, multiple times to avoid these other vehicles. I mean, at some point it would be, you'd stretch the system too far. But if the other guy knows there's somebody here and we can figure out a way to share better, I think that makes a lot of sense. This airspace is finite. It's big, but it's finite.

Lorne knows where aviation has been, where it is today and talks about how he believes we're going forward in aviation. You'll enjoy Lorne's overview of the aviation industry, airline operations, the challenges faced by airline operations, and few can tell you better about the opportunities available to our innovators facing not just tomorrow's challenges, but today's opportunities for near term operational optimization. Innovators and their investors should take note. There are so many opportunities for innovators from Lorne's discussion. Starting with where he believes few agree with them on, to the challenges, airlines and airports face today, to the requirements of today's and tomorrow's operators to the challenges and opportunities of air traffic optimization and to the requirements and opportunities for data sharing and coordination in our complex airspace. Something that would be fun to hear what some of today's leaders in traditionally aviation and advanced air mobility discovered from Lorne's discussion and from some of the other conversations with other guests we've had on the podcast that talk about today's aviation challenges and opportunities and how current conditions may or may not impact how drone, drone delivery, UTM and other advanced air mobility OEMs operators and investors think and plan for the future. So with all that said many thanks to Lorne for a terrific discussion and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our discussion with Lorne Cass as you innovate for today's and tomorrow's opportunities in The Vertical Space.

Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think as we talk about new entrants, there may be very few that agree with me that noise will be an issue. I think, generally speaking, there's a thought that the new entrant operations, AAMs, eVTOL, etc., believe that they're much quieter and the public won't have an issue with noise. But I've been in many, many public noise meetings in neighborhoods, and for sure, the mantra today is, If I see you, I hear you. So unless it's done right, the noise people can make it very difficult to grow the market. So I would say noise may be something that people don't really agree with me on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, now, isn't that something now me knowing you a little bit, I'm very well aware that your awareness of community noise and the impact of the community is critical. And most people don't think about it,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right.

We're seeing lots being done with the FAA and several of the new entrant operators, OEMs, and those that intend to operate. I think there are some areas where we've done a good job with communities. But let me just give you an example. I live out in the, in the Phoenix area and there's a particular homeowners association here that, took a vote about six months ago saying there'd be no drone deliveries in our neighborhood. Now, can they just shut that off? No, but when they go to the city council and the state government and eventually the federal government, they will be heard. So I think it's really important for new entrant operators and those that plan to operate in that public arena, to show the benefit and show that they will be a good neighbor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, a lot of OEMs and operators are thinking about noise and doing all they can on the design side, operation side, to minimize the noise footprint. So in what ways is your observation of this topic different in ways that people disagree with you?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I would say mine goes back, of course, to the, the traditional aviation. That's where I've mostly been in these public hearings where they're talking about noise and communities and so forth. But the noise community is strong. And I was at a meeting just two years ago, an FAA sponsored meeting on, The New World of Drones, AAM, and so forth. And there was, this was out in Long Island, and there was a woman there from this noise community association, and she was adamant that I don't want to see you anywhere near my neighborhood. I don't want to see you going overhead. You tell me you're going to be quieter than what I hear today. And she said, I get that. She said, but I don't want you there because if I see you, I'm going to hear you. And that's the first place I heard that. But I've heard it several times since then. I think it's a matter of working with the public to help them understand the value in the service and the product you intend to provide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was just about to ask you about the value and how the perception of value will influence this, conversation around noise. One of the most annoying sounds to me is the noise of the leaf blowers\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, me too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And they are constant, but we accept it because, we get good value out of it. So how do you bring value into the discussion around drone delivery, and especially given that this is something that will benefit everyone, not just, the 10 percent or the 5 percent of the population.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. I think you start with showing the value. So first of all, when I look at initial drone activity and drone value, I see it very much in the first responder arena, medical arena, et cetera. And I think if we can start that off and do it right, which I think there's a lot of good work going on there now. I think the public will start to accept it, and then you can expand into the neighborhood delivery and so forth. I'm sure there are some neighborhoods in the country that would have no issue whatever with drones flying up and down their street in lieu of FedEx or UPS vans doing the same thing. But I do believe it's going to take more outreach than maybe some realize through these local public entities to get people on board and to feel more comfortable with it. It's new and they'll just need to better understand it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, the other thing that I don't think a lot of people appreciate, but when you see the noise abatement offices in the airports around the country, and you see the focus that they have on addressing every single request that comes in.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh my,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I still remember talking to an FAA administrator just a couple years ago, former FAA administrator just a couple years ago. And, there was a question as to some, people in the Boston area objecting to a new procedure for NextGen. I think it was a new PBN or RNAV procedure. And this administrator said there were a couple of people who were complaining in the Boston area about this procedure and it didn't go through.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It doesn't take much.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I don't know if everybody can appreciate the effects of, even though 95 percent of the people think it's the greatest thing. If one or two people complain, a congressman gets a hold of that, it's possible it just won't happen. I mean, is this part of your reason why we have to pay so much attention to noise?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, most definitely. And I mean, there's a good emission story to be told in most cases. I think that's a good thing for the public, but, you've got to do the noise and do it right because it doesn't take much. I lived in Minneapolis for several years, as and the community there is very sensitive to noise. And a lot of things that, most airports should and could do, the Minneapolis airport was unable to do it because of the limitations around the community. And I can't tell you how many properties they had to end up buying in order to operate the airport. Other places? I lived in Dallas for several years. Didn't hear a whole lot of complaints around the airport there. And this is interesting too. The DFW airport specifically, as you recall, was built in the 70s. And it was built out in the middle of nowhere, directly in between Dallas and Fort Worth. There was nobody complaining about noise then. However, today, the communities are built right up to the boundary of the airport. And now they are starting to see noise complaints that they never had in the past. That's relatively new, but I think it, a lot depends on the public, who they are, where they are, what part of the country. this area, Phoenix is generally an area that is sensitive to noise also. The airport has gone through all kinds of gyrations to accommodate the public, in terms of how they fly airplanes in and out of there, and not very efficient routings, to be honest, and that is one thing they've had to live with for years in order to accommodate, the noise concerns of the community. Now, did the airlines pack up and leave and go away and say, nope, we're not flying there because they're all too concerned about noise? No. They did a lot of things, maybe they didn't want to do, maybe they weren't the most cost efficient, but they did it so the public would accept them. And not force them to do things they didn't want to do. So I think noise will be there and I'm not trying to say that's going to be the overriding issue, but I do think noise will be an issue in certain areas. Let me give you one example, by the way, and I would say, don't confuse the noise community and the emissions community, the CO2 emissions community, and I'll give you an example there in San Francisco, there's been a battle going on for many years to reroute departures out of San Francisco and Oakland late at night so that they fly out over the bay and then over the bridge out into the ocean. If they're going to go eastbound, let's say to New York, it adds about 60 or 70 additional flying miles. The noise community was thrilled because they've fought over this for years with the local congressional people in the room with them. Believe me, I was there. They finally implemented this or started the implementation a couple of years ago now. And what do you think happened? The emissions community said, what? You're flying an extra 60 or 70 miles? You know how many more missions that is per flight every day, every night? And so the battle is there. But the noise community was happy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you think that perceptions of noise change over, many years over a long duration of time? Like what was it like when automobiles were first introduced and where people, I'd love to see research on this. Were people complaining about the noise of automobiles because it was a new sound in the environment and that's why they noticed it and their brains didn't filter it out. But now automobiles are just part of the environment. They're part of the background. And. I don't think that we have a commensurate level of noise complaints there. So I wonder in the aviation landscape, have noise perceptions of large aircraft changed over the years will it be a different story with these smaller things like drones? Are we going to get accustomed to them? Is the long term arc of this one of how do we get through the introduction of this and see people, start to get accustomed to it and see how the noise response behavior changes over that time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:43\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's that. I think it will take time. I've been around a long time. I wasn't around when automobiles first showed up. But I was certainly around when there were a lot of noisy jets that were flying around, really noisy jets as compared to today. And people did complain, but it was all in the way you looked at it as well. Obviously, for those of you that ever been to a military, air facility, often you would see signs that said, it's the sound of freedom. I know we're noisy, but it's the sound of freedom. When I lived in Minneapolis, my neighbor would complain to me about all the noisy DC 9s flying over our house. And I would always say to him, tongue in cheek, that's the sound of my paycheck. I like it. So, I think it's definitely in the perception. I do believe that I'll just say the airline industry in general, heavy transport aircraft, have done a great job of reducing the noise, but the noise community, the serious noise community, is still out there and still complaining and just doesn't want anything near their house.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And can have an outsized impact on the FAA and different organizations with just a couple of complaints.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most definitely. And when you get, when you're at the FAA and you get letters from mostly from folks in Congress that are closer to their communities, they mean something. And I've been in two or three different meetings where the local congressional delegation or the congressman or congresswoman themselves were in the room and the FAA had to be responsive. And so did the airport authorities that were in the room as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What have you seen as most efficient strategies in the way that airlines dealt with community, on the topic of noise, that something that maybe the drone world can learn from?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think it was a combination of not just the operator, but it was also finding community leaders that recognize the value to the community and whether it was a, like I said, a first responder value or a value in terms of delivering goods and services more efficiently, there's questions about the roads. I mean, obviously traffic is not getting any better. So there are things like that I think that can be used, but in, in the airline world, in a lot of cases, it would be the airlines getting together with airport authorities, which are important and have a lot of community members in them, and working to see what's the best approach to the community, having meetings with the community are very round table noise meetings, and a lot of these airports are important. I think the, future operations to and from airports will already have a start in that area in terms of if you're going to fly a eVTOL or whatever, I think that's, you're going to have a good start because they're already going to have some mechanism for doing that. If you're going to fly to the, a vertiport that's downtown, whether it's on top of a building or someplace downtown or out in the sticks in an area that has not typically had, I'll put this in quotes, aircraft around it, I think you're going to have to go out, find the local community leaders, introduce yourself, and say, we want to be a good community member, participate and show the value of what we deliver. I think it's really important to get those people in the room as quickly as you can.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, terrific. all stemming from what those things that people don't agree with you on, Tell us a little bit about, you have years of experience in the airline industry. Give us an overview of the industry, based on your experience and also that the evolution of technology during that time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the technology has evolved quite a bit. I mean, when I started in the industry, the very first airline I worked for was a very small airline that operated DC 6s and Lockheed Electras. And that Electra was leap years ahead of the DC 6 in terms of how fast it could go, where it could go, and so forth. And of course now today we're flying much more modern transports. They get from A to B much quicker. They are much more reliable than it used to be. When you think of reciprocating, aircraft engines and the reliability, I mean, they were reliable, but they required tons and tons of maintenance. Lots of moving parts, literally. And so that has improved, dramatically. The aircraft themselves have improved dramatically. In terms of managing them from an ops control perspective, and operations for an airline, the technology has moved very much away from, literally teletype. Teletype was around in sending messages on aircraft movements in many places until just 10, maybe 15 years ago at the most. Still there. obviously when we were able to send messages more directly using computers and email and so forth, that changed it. The tracking mechanisms for the aircraft, it used to be when the aircraft took off, the pilot knew exactly where he was. The dispatcher was tracking him just like air traffic control in many cases did by manual position reports given by radio. Can you imagine that today? That still happens over some of the long transatlantic flights and so forth. So I would say, and something you've been involved with certainly Jim, is surveillance. When we first talked some many years ago, all I wanted from the product you had, I wanted to know where my airplanes were. It was important to me. It was important to me to be able to be more efficient in figuring out if the guy that was number 10 in holding, if I wanted to get him out of holding first by coordinating with ATC. But in the past, I wouldn't know and he wouldn't know. He wouldn't know if he was number one or number 21 in a holding stack, for example. So I think the knowing where the aircraft are and what they're doing, the data that are exchanged, is huge. The data that's exchanged in terms of the efficiency of the airspace operation is also huge. So almost 30 years ago now, the FAA and industry, airline industry, got together and talked about, well, what if we exchange data? So we better understand we have more accurate, more predictable times. So for example, if a, American flight 123 is scheduled to depart at 0800, but the airline knows because of a passenger connection issue or crew issue or whatever it is, it's really not going to depart till 0845, there was really no good way to pass that along. You had about this two hour window around your proposed time, but then came along collaborative decision making out of this where we started to exchange some of those things. So you can imagine, initially, when we, the airline community, were working with the FAA and there were three airlines that started this off, exchanging very basic data with the FAA, and they would in turn sort of exchange it with the other participants, so you'd have a better picture of what was going on at LaGuardia, what was going on at Minneapolis, what was going on in Dallas. And this collaborative decision making effort came out of that. Now, I can promise you, in the first few years of, it's called CDM, in the late 90s, going and telling my boss that we were going to share information, and I put that in quotes, with for example, our competitor United Airlines or Delta Airlines, that didn't go over very well. What? No, we're not. We're not sharing it. We're not telling them what we're doing. But when you work through it and understand if everybody, gives better information, more accurate information on what they're actually doing today and when they intend to operate. Whether this is an airline, by the way, or general aviation, business aviation primarily, it makes a huge difference for the entire, national airspace in terms of operating more efficiently. So, I would say today it's about, I'll call it surveillance for a loose term. where is my airplane right now? I also want to know where it's predicted to go. We can do that with some of these tools. But I also want to be able to exchange the appropriate data very quickly and very reliably, in order to improve the operation for everybody. And that's coming more and more.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you think about the introduction of the new vehicles, and you think about data sharing, what kind of advice would you give to them that, things that they're going to have to anticipate that they may not be thinking about today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think it's important to understand that. So I have heard a few new vehicle type operators, and I would say this is primarily among the drone community say things like, we'll just separate ourself. Okay. I think that's probably possible. However, once you start operating in airspace where there are other operators, and if they're also saying, well, we'll just separate ourselves, and there's a third operator, so we'll just separate ourselves, at some point, you're not going to be separating yourself. So there's really going to be a need to exchange that data, track data, intent data, and so forth, so we can all live together more efficiently. Can you imagine the airline industry, if everybody was separating themselves, and the only way that they would, change the track as if they got a TCAS warning that says turn right and descend immediately. Same thing in the drone community. Wouldn't be very efficient. If you were operating, let's say, drone delivery service and didn't know that somebody else was out there and you're altering your course, multiple times to avoid these other vehicles. I mean, at some point it would be, you'd stretch the system too far. So, but if the other guy knows there's somebody here and we can figure out a way to share better, I think that makes a lot of sense. This airspace is finite. It's big, but it's finite. And we have to figure out a way to share it with everybody in a much more flexible, much more dynamic way..\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So to that end, we want to talk about airline operations just a minute with your deep experience there. So we're obviously seeing a lot of growth, a lot of demand in the airline and the air travel area. How do we bring capacity to the system to account for that continued growth?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think first of all, there's a lot of fingers that are pointed at the FAA for not being quick enough to move forward. I think there is some truth to that. However, they have masters that work up on that big hill in DC and respectfully work for them. And a lot of times programs that they have underway are, interrupted. Not purposefully, but interrupted by deliberations on the Hill that could have nothing to do with that particular program, but affects the, I'll just say the stable flow of, the financing for the FAA. So I think the number one thing we have to do is make sure that the FAA stays as the, the entity it's been for years as the North Star for safety and efficiency for the world airspace, if you will. And I think a lot of that's going to really depend on finding a way to ensure they have a stable funding mechanisms. And I think you probably heard that from my good friend, Mr. Rinaldi, who you talked to a few months ago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Lorne, can you talk a little bit more, in some greater level of detail, when we look back at how technology helped accommodate increasing demand, on the national airspace system, how that was, how that achieved, whether through, greater surveillance or better management of the traffic, various technologies along the way. And then, projecting into the next couple of decades where people forecast the doubling of air traffic, how will that be accommodated? Any particular technologies that you're excited about or see the potential in?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think there are a lot of technologies that are coming to bear, just not quick enough. So for example, I'll the FAA's communication system between facilities and so forth is still today, largely a wired system and the facilities that the FAA uses in the U.S. I'm gonna use that as an example. If you think of the number of centers, there are about 20 centers in the United States, and they date back to the cold war. And when decentralized facilities was, seemed a very good thing, because if there was some sort of an attack in one place, not the other, you could still have these decentralized, these places that could sustain on their own without having to be connected to anything else, but the world has changed dramatically from then and the, the way data can move is moving and is moving towards is in a much different fashion. And the FAA is trying to move there, but it's not easy. And remember, they are very concerned about the reliability and redundancy of any system they deploy because, they're protecting airspace and they're protecting vehicles from running into each other and loss of life. So they're very keen on their number one goal, which is safety. Efficiency is secondary, but once we do a better job of exchanging these data and surveilling the airspace, and the surveillance has improved dramatically, when I started as an air traffic controller many years ago, there wasn't a digitized target. So when I saw a target on my radar, what I saw was a target, if you will, a blip as people like to say, but I saw a target. And I had to, in my head, know who that was. And I had to know what I was doing with the airplane, what its speed was, what altitude, and so forth. In the mid 70s, in the center environment, they came forward with digitized radar, which for the first time used multiple radar sites feeding into a digitizer, and actually created a target on a radar screen. And I could see the identity of the aircraft, destination, type of aircraft, speed, altitude, etc. That was a huge leap forward in surveillance. That same sort of surveillance is still there today. It's still overlaid, so all these systems overlay into one or another, so I can use four or five radar systems to get a much more accurate picture of where the aircraft is going. I can use GPS as well, So I, I have much, much better, much more accurate surveillance. Communication systems with the airplanes, from the ground to the airplane are slowly changing, and, the controller pilot data link system is coming on board now and it's, I would say, in the center environment, it'll be out there over the next five years or so. I think most of the centers will be in the CPDLC environment. Many of them are already there and moving there. And that will make a difference because that will help with, I'll call it, routine communications. So when you're passing from one center to another, rather than the controller saying, clean the mic and saying, Delta 126, contact New York Center on 12345. Have a nice day. And then the pilot coming back and saying, Delta 1 2 3, we'll do the same, see you, bye bye. it'll be sent digitized, like a text message. like they get, they've had for years with ACARS. ACARS from ARINC has been in airplane cockpits for many years. And airlines have been able to communicate with their aircraft using digital messaging. But air traffic control has not. So that type of thing is going to make a huge difference. As well as tools that, for the future, are going to do a much better job of not only saying here's where we are, but here's where things are going, and I'm talking about in real time. So more predictive information around tracks. We've already had, in the last 10 or 15 years, the ability for these conflict probes using this digitized radar to look out for a controller, let's say that's working in Denver Center, and say, hey, if you don't do something, United 123 and Delta 425 are going to have a problem up here in 20 miles or so. And the controller could then take some sort of corrective action to change the track or the altitude on one or the other. So those things are getting more and more efficient. I think in the future, and there's some of this already going on, we need to do a better job of collecting data every day, for every operation, whether it's a bad weather operation or it's a perfectly beautiful day, and pull that all in and analyze it. And then use what I see as a value of future AI in the future for air traffic control, for example, is then learning from the last event we had and make sure we don't do something that gave us a problem on the last event in the next event, and doing that fairly quickly. I'm a little bit, I hear some people talking about, AI should be, the first thing out there in terms of safety, but I think we need to wait until it proves itself before we have it being the primary safety tool. That's my own thought. So really, that's I hope that sort of answered your question. I think where we've come from is good. Where we're going is good. Getting there in between is difficult. When NextGen was first announced by Russ Chew back in, what, 2005 or so, One of the problems with NextGen is they got a name called NextGen and everybody expected on January 1st, 2020, everything was going to be fixed. It just doesn't work quite that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there lessons from the rollout of CPDLC that, help inform what our expectations should be for the rate of adoption of these other\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>things. Well, I can't speak to all the issues with CPDLC, but I can tell you, I'll give you an example. So the gent I just mentioned, Russ Chew, came from American Airlines before he went to the FAA, and American was very heavily involved in Miami Center, in testing CPDLC on a number of aircraft with the FAA. And he was a very strong supporter of CPDLC and what it did. He then was at the FAA and a couple of years later realized that the FAA simply did not have the funding available to roll out this capability. I think they were originally planning it three or four centers along the East Coast and he had to put, he didn't put the program on hold, but he had to stretch it out a lot farther. And again, that kind of goes back to, do they have a stable funding mechanism that allows them to react to these things and keep things moving forward rather than be sidelined for a while. The FAA many times on these programs when we have a government shutdowns or whatever, they have to stop everything they're doing. And imagine if they had a program that had two prime contractors and maybe 30 subcontractors. All of that work stops. So if I'm a little subcontractor with 10 people and my funding is stopped and I have no idea when it's coming back, I may in fact have to lay off people. And maybe some of those are really critical people. And when we start up again in three or four or five or six months. That person I let go that I really needed is working for somebody else or gone someplace else. So you can imagine how it, the, the pile on effect that occurs and CPDLC, I think was caught with that because it was very promising. And it's taken many years longer than originally thought to get it out there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, Let's talk a little bit about airline operations. Tell us, what's the goal? What's the impact on the airline, its financials? Tell us how an airline operation runs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So let's talk about what's important to the airline. First of all, they provide a customer service. And they're in business to make a profit, like any company that's in business. First of all, they have to develop a schedule. It's going to be a scheduled operation, which most of them are scheduled operations. And they have to be able to deliver safe and reliable service. And those are the key things. So if you think about an operations control center, they are in fact responsible for that day to day operation of the airline in real time. And things change in real time. And I would say to any new operator that plans to be out there in this world, that you can plan on something happening you never expected in a million years will happen. And you have to be prepared to react and prepare for it and so forth. But for an Ops Control Center, the most important thing is safe, efficient, reliable, and obviously financially sound operations. So what they're going to look at in most cases, their key metrics are completion factor. That means how many flights did I cancel or hopefully none. My departure performance, let's just call it on time performance. So departure performance for most airlines, they measure it from what they call D0. D0 simply means Departing on Schedule. My schedule said I was going to depart at 13. 05. I departed at 1305. Not 13. 07, not 13. 20. D0 performance. Then, obviously, arrival performance, because that's really important to the airline, as well as to that customer. The customer may be going to a meeting that day, may be going to visit, Aunt Sally, or may be trying to make a connection at that airport, so that arrival time is very important. And that's one of the metrics, of course, that's critically important to the DOT when they're providing overview. And then, of course, they need to look at their, what they call their block time performance. In other words, if they planned that this flight from Detroit to Denver was going to take two hours and one minute, how reliable are they? If that's what they planned in their schedule planning, how good are they at hitting that two hours and one minute? So they measure that in what they call block time performance. And You don't want your block time performance to be too high because you're paying everybody involved, that airplane crew and everything else, based on what you show as the planned block time or anything over that. So let's just say that if you plan two hours on that stretch and every day you are actually flying in an hour and a half, it's costing you that additional 30 minutes for just, let's just say the crew time, as well as over the course of a day, if your block time performance is too high, you are wasting an aircraft by the end of the day. So if it was 30 minutes on every leg and that airplane flew, let's say eight legs, you might've been able to fly another complete flight with that airplane. So how good did you plan the performance of that airplane? So the advanced planning, and then obviously the post ops analysis are critical for some of the reasons we mentioned earlier, let's look at what we did yesterday and see if we can do this better tomorrow. Does that make sense?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:43\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It does two things real quickly. One is, if you know it only takes 90 minutes to fly, why is your block just not 90 minutes every day?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think because there are some days where it might take you, if it's a two hour block, there might be some days where you take two hours and 14 minutes, or two hours and 22 minutes, particularly on a busy route that has a lot of, I'll just say, uncertainties around ATC or other issues. So you may pad that block because you know In order to get that A14, that you want, the on time arrival, you may need to pad that a little bit so that you can be more assured that you're going to hit that A14. Now, if you look at today, in my view, if I look at airline block times today, they are much higher, than they were, let's say 15, 20 years ago, because the system is not able to support some of the level of demand that's out there. And, airline CEOs are much more cognizant of the focus on airline cancellations and on time performance. So they, sometimes they'll pad that block, but it costs them money to pad it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now I understand that some level of, padding or sandbagging of this block time is necessary, but what would it take for the entire system to get more lean as it relates to block time? Is that even possible?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is it impossible? No. I think it just depends on where the focus is, and the focus seems to change now and again. I think as we get more efficient with using airspace and some of these new capabilities and technologies come along, I think, the block time will automatically start shrinking down to a more acceptable level. I can tell you that I worked for one boss at, at an airline, a large airline. Jim's familiar with it, that he wanted block time to be at somewhere around 65%. That's low. Today, when I look at block\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Explain 65\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in other words, 65 percent of the time is acceptable. in reaching that two hour block, if that's what I had planned, rather than 85 percent of the time, because it's cheaper. And again, I'm not a guy that builds block times and I'm not familiar with every single thing that goes into them, but a lot of it has to do with crew, aircraft, where's that airplane going to be, the lines of flying that they build, and so forth. Today, I would say I see several airlines that are at least 10 points above that, which is a lot. And some of them that are actually in the 80s, which means maybe they planned a day that they expected they were going to be, because of the time of year, the time of week or whatever it was, that there were going to be typically a lot of delays and none of them materialized. So all of a sudden their block performance goes up dramatically. A lot of the block padding has to do with, I think, in my humble opinion, and the inefficiencies in the operations today. Hopefully we can improve in the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if somebody comes and pitched you a better way of, predicting off block time or just broadly improving on time performance, how would you evaluate this technology? How big of a lift would it be to, include that in the entire, sausage making machine for lack of better analogy to actually make an impact at the end of the day?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I can tell you, I had a lot of people in my office over the years that had this great idea that was going to be, that was going to solve all my problems. Usually it was one thing that was going to fix everything. I'll say this first, what I found sometimes, many times is whomever and whatever they were trying to sell, they weren't asking me what I needed. They were telling me what they thought I needed. So, I think that's one thing that a lot of companies, and there are lots of good things going on out there today in order to improve the operation in real time and take shortcuts and routes and so forth. some of those are all good things. Any little minute or two you can save here and there is really important. Other things happen to be, can we do a better job of predicting weather? Many years ago, I had somebody from a very large company with a very large weather service that came in and told me they could give me 48 hours notice as to when a thunderstorm would impact one of my, the outer arrival fixes, let's say to this big airport. And I was pretty certain that was not possible. We did it a test for a summer. And it was not even close to possible. I said, if you can predict that four hours in advance, I'd be happy, much less 48 hours. So, I think that it's, it is about data. There is a lot of work going on today in terms of collecting data and then presenting it to an airline in a usable form. There are a couple of airlines, including one I'm quite familiar with that have done a lot of really good in house work and understanding and evaluating in real time what's going on with the operation and what's the best way to react to it. For example, if there's a big weather event that goes through, I'll just say DFW, and they have 70 diversions, all right, in the past, maybe it was just, okay, we got to get those airplanes back. There was not a lot of thought put to prioritizing getting those airplanes back, other than sort of from seat of the pants, this dispatcher or this ops coordinator knows that this particular flight's got 80 connections. And all that occurred, but that occurred in a manual fashion. Today, there are technologies that are pulling all those data together and then saying, here's how you should recover these diversions, if that makes sense to you, but that type of thing, we need to get better at doing that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>39:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned something very interesting that nobody really asked you what you needed. At the time, what are some of the things that you needed then? And importantly, what are some of the things that the industry needs today? What are some of the main frustrations when it comes to running airline operations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Predictability really is the number one thing. So whether it's an internal, first of all, you have to really understand the condition of the airline internally as an airline. What's going on with my aircraft, technical issues, airport issues, crew issues, spare aircraft issues, because all of those things ultimately are going to impact my customer. And at the end of the day, my customer is what impacts my bottom line. So those are the things internally I have to know. Externally, I have to have a much better idea, and much more predictability for what is happening today in this airspace system in which we're going to operate. Because once I get the wheels in the well of an airplane, it's out of my hands. There's a lot of other people involved. Obviously the crew are involved. I promise you that the dispatchers in these big airline ops centers, are coordinating with the crews and giving them updates, real time information for something that's going to occur three or four hundred miles in front of them. So there's a lot of good exchange of information that's going along. In terms of that, trying to pull all that together with all the operators that are out there that are, relying on this same airspace, this very finite airspace, we need to share as much information as possible so we can all use it most efficiently. And that includes, by the way, the military, who I have a great deal of respect for the military, and of course their missions are changing, but they have a tremendous amount of airspace that they use every day for training and so forth and sometimes it's available, but the FAA and operators, don't know it's available. So if you could imagine, if you're flying from Dallas to Los Angeles, you go right through New Mexico where the White Sands Missile Range is located. There's an airway that goes right through the middle of White Sands Missile Range, and it's usually closed because there's something going on in White Sands Missile Range that they don't want you flying directly over it. So that means you either have to go to the south, around the very south end of the White Sands Missile Range, which means you're over El Paso, or roughly over the north end, which means you're over Albuquerque. So that adds extra time and fuel and CO2 emissions that may not be necessary if you only knew that J65, was actually available and you could have flown through there. Now there's a lot of work in that area to make it more dynamic and predictable and improving the data exchange between DOD and FAA. So that they each know, they have a much better idea of when this airspace is going to be available, making it more flexible and usable. So others can use it, but we're still not there. Predicting what's going to happen is really important. So I can understand, like I said, from the very beginning, I can predict what is going to impact this particular flight, but I also need to understand what may be impacting the FAA and what may cause me an issue farther down the line. I also have to have a very close eye on my customers and what I'm doing or not doing that can impact them. But it's still at the top of the list would be give me data that I can use to make my operation more predictable. And predictable doesn't mean that I'm going to depart every day on my schedule at 0800. It means that I know that I'm going to have to factor in a delay of 23 minutes for that flight. As early as possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When it comes to dealing with unexpected circumstances, whether this is weather, rerouting, ground delays, or any number of things, and somewhere I've heard that about 15 percent of total fuel is wasted on these kinds of inefficiencies, but dealing with these inefficiencies, is that currently done mostly by human expertise, intuition, or to what extent is technology being used? And, certainly some things on the horizon that you're excited about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I would say, yes, it has been mostly done by human experience, intuition, and so forth. That has been changing, and it's a changing for the better. And as more information are available to these humans, more data are available, I think that's going to improve that efficiency. You are right about the amount of fuel that's carried. Let me give you an example. Go back to that military airspace. Let's say I was planning a flight from Dallas to Los Angeles, and I knew the J 65 would be open. I wouldn't have to put that additional fuel on that airplane which would allow it to fly around the corner on the north or south end, for example, of White Sands. Even if I'm in route already and carrying this additional fuel, I can save some. If they open it up while I'm flying, I can go through there. But, the reason it's important to know ahead of time, in that case, and there's where some of this technology today, and some of the data that our exchange are going to be exchanged in the future, I hope, between DoD and FAA, will allow me to plan that from the very start, because in some cases, if I'm on a route, let's just say around a weather area or military area, whatever it is, it's a long reroute around that area, and I have to put extra fuel on the airplane to do that, and then somehow when I'm, I get the wheels in while I'm flying, and the controller says, oh guess what, that area's opened up now, you can go direct to Miami. And I take a direct route, in some cases, I have to go into holding and dump, if I can, most airplanes can't these days, or burn off fuel to get down to the landing weight because I could actually be over my maximum landing weight because I have too much fuel on the airplane. So predictability there, again, is a key. If I knew that ahead of time, it wouldn't have been a problem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, you said something about the FAA, knowing about the intentions, the behavior of the FAA, what is it, why is that important and what kind of information do you need and what needs are there that potentially could be met by technology firms?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think there's already some technology firms that are helping them meet that and I think there are technology firms that are helping airlines and operators better understand what may or may not happen. It starts in many cases because weather is usually one of the biggest things that impacts the throughput in a given chunk of airspace. I think the forecasts are getting better and options are getting better. I think there are several small companies that are really good at pulling this together, aggregating all these data and presenting it in a way to an airline that they can better understand it, I think in some cases, and this is why the CDM is so good. Because. As I said, a lot of the dialogue around what we're going to do today in the NAS occurs every two hours with a phone call between airline operation centers, NBAA also has a desk that stays involved. AOPA has a desk to better understand, what's going on. But there's an exchange of information there as well. Some years ago, when I was at Northwest Airlines, Northwest had a very well known and well thought of meteorology department. Not everybody had one, but I'm just using them as an example because I was there. And often, our FAA colleagues at the FAA Command Center would ask the Northwest Airlines meteorologists for what their prediction was for weather in a certain area to compare that with what the FAA had received from NWS and then, try to pull those things together and come up with a good plan. And that's not just, I'm saying it wasn't just that airline, there's other airlines that have their own meteorologists, bigger airlines do that was an exchange of information. It was very good. But I think there are small companies, as I said, some of them that are looking out today and working with airlines, two or three airlines have contracts with some of these folks to help them better plan a route of flight based on what they know, at least at that time, prior to departure that they can plan a better route, and then when they're in route, to help them find a few shortcuts here and there. Save 10 miles here, 10 miles there, because some constraint that was there, be it weather or otherwise, traffic management initiative, for example, didn't materialize, and they can save a few minutes. Minutes is fuel is cost, and fuel burn is obviously emissions, which are critically I would say a lot of folks, by the way, and I've even suggested to some of these small companies, for years up until pretty recently, they would talk about fuel burn and fuel cost savings. And they're certainly there. But today you really need to work right into that first sentence when you're selling green. This is, it has an emissions benefit because it does, fewer emissions. If every minute you don't have that engine burning is obviously fewer emissions. So that's important.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, when thinking about, ways to improve throughput in the National Airspace System, spacing of aircraft comes to mind. Can you talk about, how spacing is done today, and what the main limiting factors are? And ways that can be improved in the future. One thing that comes to mind is voice based communication. The, throughput limits on that channel, and all of the limitations associated with it are compensated in, among other ways in spacing out aircraft, perhaps more than it might be possible. So to what extent is that limiting the spacing and how do you see technology improving that aspect of operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think technology, in my humble opinion, could have already improved some of that over time. So, I'll give you an example. I mentioned before that many years ago when the center environment went from these single site broadband radars that looked out 200 miles each, and the farther away you got from the antenna, the bigger the target got, and all those kind of things. So, in the in route environment, five miles separation between aircraft, was always the mantra. That was the requirement, 5 miles. Because of the fact that you could get so far away from the antenna, the target would actually grow in size the farther you got. When the digitized radar came along, all of a sudden you had a target that was always one uniform size, and it was fed by multiple radar sites. So it was a pretty accurate positioning of that target. There was a discussion at that time in reducing that separation to three miles, but it didn't happen. And, in the terminal area where there's a single radar site and it's looking out 40 miles and not 200 miles and turning at a much faster rate that three mile separation has also been there for some period of time. Now there, there is work going on today, not to reduce separation, but to use tools on the aircraft, for example, to do a better job of managing the spacing. So that if I'm looking at the airplane in front of me and I'm in the following aircraft and I can see who it is, where they are, what their speed is and so forth. And I'm needing to maintain separation there. I might be able to do that. I'm not separating myself. I'm managing the interval. And that's important because when you start saying to a controller or even to a pilot that you're going to, and I'll use these words loosely, self separate, that's not a good thing because then, it comes down to one of the things we'll talk about at some point, who's actually responsible if something goes wrong, responsible, who has the authority, who's going to be held accountable. But the good news about this interval management, which is being tested in two or three places, is very promising. This interval management may help us reduce the separation, and I'm talking now about longitudinal separation, obviously, between aircraft. Vertical separation, which is essentially 1, 000 feet between aircraft, until, I guess it's 20 years ago now, hard to believe, until reduced vertical separation minima came about. When you were above about 30, 000 feet, you had to be separated by 2, 000 foot intervals. Below that was a thousand, and that changed to a thousand feet, and there was a lot of concern about it at the time, but it worked very well, and that was that was based on better equipment in the aircraft, more accurate altimetry, and so forth. So I do think that this, interval management work that's going on is probably going to help us at some point get to reduced spacing between aircraft longitudinally.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, let's, I want to, in a few minutes, we want to start talking about, how you evaluate technology firms that come to you. Oh, you've already mentioned one is. first ask what the airline is looking for rather than just telling about your capabilities. But let's say you just, you gave us an overview of the airline, you gave us an overview of the airline operation. You talked about the complexities, you talked about the importance of predicting, What's going to happen, which runs a better operation. So let's now say we have 10 or 15 new entrants in the market 5 10 years from now. Let's say eVTOL. Let's say you have drone air delivery operations at, Dallas and a lot of different locations. And given your experience in operations, what are some of the things that excite you and what are some of the things that concern you and what advice would you give to somebody who is running those operations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First of all, I would say that, first and foremost, I would say that it's very important, that they understand the FAA role, and I think it's important that they understand that the FAA is, many different divisions and departments and so forth. and I know for example, at one point a CEO made a comment, to an individual that I know, that said, well, this is two years ago now by the way, it's not recent. Two years ago he said. Well, we talked to the FAA and they really like our concept, so we don't see any problem. And the question back to that CEO at the time was, which FAA did you talk to? And he was a little bit taken aback by that. And the comment was, look, Who, anyway, they talked through this and determined that it was somebody in the FAA certification office. And so he was told, well, the certification person is looking at your vehicle and saying, does it look like it can fly? And from what he or she saw, yeah, it looks like it'll fly. But there are many more steps, seven or eight more steps, to you actually are in a position where you have a vehicle and you have a paying customer on board that vehicle, most especially. So I think it's, I would say that's one thing to try to better understand the FAA and how they work and so forth. And I think there's some of the new entrants that are out there, I think are doing a pretty darn good job of that and are pretty well known in the FAA headquarters building and the FAA arena. Others probably could do a little more in that area, but I think they have to think about for the future, let's say eVTOL operator, or AAM operator. They have to think about, the vehicle, they have to think about its limitations. They have to think about, how do they track what it's doing? How do they operate it in real time? If it's a network they're operating, once they have two or three vehicles out there operating, and something happens with one of the vehicles where it can't operate, how are they going to, what are their contingencies for doing that? What are the, what kind of redundancy do they have built in? And I think there's a lot of that needs to, needs to occur with the new operators.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Lorne, when it comes to, technologies that people use in, airline operation centers and broadly in, those corner of airlines that are involved in running the operation, ensuring a smooth operation, how often do the technologies there get updated? And when we think about the innovators in our audience, the entrepreneurs, what are the best pathways for new technologies to get in there and be adopted?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think first of all, you have to visit and you have to see and understand what these airline operation centers do, how they work and so forth. I think that, they also need to understand the airline's customer. And I think they're, everybody's flown somewhere. So you know what it's like to be a passenger on an airplane, The airlines probably have some prioritization of customers. You're going to have certain customers that travel often expect something a little bit higher than others so I think understanding the airline customer will be good going and actually sitting in one of these airline operation centers. Don't go in and say, I have a great idea. go in there and say, I'd like to learn more about your business, because I think I have some ideas that might be helpful in the future, There needs to be a little more of a merging and not just at the commercial level, because a lot of the new operators are working with airlines in the commercial level, and that's really good. And I'm talking about in the chief commercial officer and that kind of arena, that's good. But if you're talking about actually operating your network, I think you need to make sure that you take that if you've got that connection and get it over so you can watch and see how an airline operates every day. And depending on what you plan to do in the future, if you may be operating under, say, Part 135, and you may be carrying four or six or whatever it is, passengers, the FAA is going to require you provide, I'll put it in quotes here, but it's important, operational control. of your aircraft and your network as you operate it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in your experience, how often is new technology introduced?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, that's a hard question. There's been a ton of new technology that's been introduced over the years. I can tell you that some of the technology, let me just use flight planning systems that airlines use, are only recently within the last two or three years, starting to update and do a better job and pull in more data, than they have in the past. So the foundational airline operating systems that have flight planning capabilities, probably go back to the late 70s. I mean, to the mainframe period. And again, I'm not somebody who built original ones, but I can tell you they, they work. They're reliable. They did not give me efficient flight plans. And a lot of times, dispatchers that work in airline operation centers, and dispatchers, by the way, are the ones that actually produce the plan for each individual flight. And with the captain they both have to sign off on that flight. They both go through the flight plan and they both agree, yep, this is a safe operation, we can do this, and they both sign it. So they have joint responsibility for operational control of that flight. The flight planning systems and the routes that are available today, in some cases, the flight planning systems of old can't really file the most efficient routes without a tremendous amount of manual intervention by a dispatcher to quote unquote build a route. Some of the newer systems, and there are a couple that, in this country and a couple from abroad, that do a much better job of smoothing that and finding a more efficient route and being able to flight plan that more efficient route. That the aircraft FMS can operate and understand. There are efficiencies that are out there today in the NAS and globally for more efficient routes that some flight planning systems simply can't do. So that's moving forward. The other thing is there are larger needs for the, I'll call it the, operation of the airline in real time, other things that tools have helped with, and I'm talking about with, for example, crew. Where are my crew? What are my limitations on my crew? Where are my airplanes? Okay, this airplane is flying six segments today, and it's going to have maintenance, so I'm going to have to plan that. All that in the past has been done. Sometime in the past, this is quite a while ago, that was plotted on a plot board, like you see on an aircraft carrier maybe or something. Those are now highly automated, or much more automated than they were in the past. They need to get a little bit better and those are the kinds of things that airlines, I promise you, are interested in. Some are, as I said, doing a lot of good work in house. Others are going to third parties to help them build these systems, but they're looking for a way to better understand. They want the whole picture, so they want to understand weather forecasts. They want to understand, what's the best planned departure time, even if my schedule says 0800. What kind of gate availability do I have? What kind of crew availability do I have? What kind of customer connections How about the ATC demand and capacity I see out there? What about IROPS recovery if I need it? And then how do I plan for the FAA's traffic management initiatives and getting the information in the right way? The FAA provides a warehouse called System Wide Information Management, where it's a data warehouse. that's available for airlines to use. Some airlines can't use it efficiently. They can only get a little information. So there are small companies that are coming out and helping the FAA to better use those data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, I, let's make a little bit of a shift to something you just brought up as it relates to demand and capacity and let's talk a little bit about the choke points. We've discussed it in some of our recent podcasts. Give a sense for where you see the choke points today in the world and what's being done about those choke points? So first, where are they? And two, what are we doing about it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mean other than New York?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is there anything other than New York, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, New York obviously is a very complex chunk of airspace. It has been, for many years now. You've got three major airports there that are all very busy in terms of commercial operations and then you have a couple or two or three of the, I'll call them smaller business or general aviation airports, but they are very busy. The airspace is compact and extremely complex. The people that work there in terms of the FAA and the controllers and so forth really deserve a pat on the back for what they do every single day because that is one tough nugget in terms of a complexity of the operation. So if you have a disruption, whether it's weather or a runway closure you didn't expect, or something else, I mean it backs up the system very quickly. I saw a depiction a few years ago that was done by MITRE, and it was of an airplane that flew from, I think it was flying from Chicago to Newark, and as it approached Newark, the runway closed, and it had to go into holding, and that meant the airplane behind that one, also had to go into holding. And that meant the next airplane had to go into holding. And then it backed up across from the New York Center into the Cleveland Center, where the New York Center controller says, hey, I can't take anymore, I got all these airplanes going into holding, because I had this runway issue. And so Cleveland Center starts holding airplanes. And then at a certain point, Cleveland Center backs up and says to Chicago Center, hey, you've got to hold airplanes. So before you knew it, holding, within about a 40 minute period, backed up from New York all the way to Minneapolis Center, and in fact, the runway closure, opened again in about, I think it was about 30 minutes, maybe a little bit less, but it caused that backup that quickly. So, it's a huge choke point, and there are so many airplanes in the airspace, there's only so many places you can go with them. The other thing is, because of the complexity of the airspace itself, the New York approach control, if you will, that, handles all the airports close in, has above it New York Center, which handles airplanes from say, let's say 18, 000 and above. And then to the north, you have Boston Center. To the west, you have Cleveland Center. To the south, you have Washington Center. All the movement of aircraft that have to move because of weather or whatever, it requires coordination with all those facilities. So imagine today, how many phone calls it takes between those facilities to coordinate just some of those simple moves. So I would say New York is still very complex and a hiccup can cause a lot of problems in a hurry and it's understandable. And the people that work there in those facilities, the controllers I'm talking about and at those airports, they have their hands full every day with a lot of traffic and a lot of things that one hiccup can really back up things quickly. Other choke points that I see today, of course, you've read about the Florida issues that are occurring. part of that has been blamed on, on controller staffing, particularly at the Jacksonville Center. I do think that is a factor. But I also think just the general demand into Florida, and the fact that it's a peninsula and offshore of Florida and to the Northeast and to the Northwest are big military training areas. And the fact you have Cuba right to the South. So it's really a limited chunk of airspace to move a lot of airplanes. And if you have any sort of hiccup, like thunderstorms do occur in Florida, it really backs things up very quickly. In the growth. In traffic, their growth of air carrier traffic, as well as general aviation and business traffic is pretty significant. And it just can't handle all the stuff that's going on. If there's any sort of a constraint on that given day, be it weather, or if it happens to be controller staffing. I think other places where there's just been so much growth that there are issues. I look out at Las Vegas. Las Vegas is very busy and getting busier. And the, the airport there, the main airport, of course, McCarran and that has been, swamped on many days. It's got a lot of limitations. It's got crossing runway issues, close parallels. So, I think those, issues. Those are what I think of as the main choke points. You also have the kind of the more traditional long range choke points, which would be some of the oceanic stuff, particularly in the North Atlantic, but that's, I think, maybe operating better than it used to. And then you have the old traditional places like Chicago, which just has volume of airplanes and, and has issues with different airports there. I mean, Midway in the and the big airport at O'Hare operate close to each other. There's a lot of other airports. Atlanta kind of sits by itself, but it has a ton of airplanes. DFW, the Dallas Fort Worth area is growing dramatically. So you will see from time to time issues down there. They usually run pretty well. I would say if there's anything that happens to them, it's thunderstorms, particularly those that, evolve in the spring and early summer that come off of the planes and meet with all that nice moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. So those are the main choke point areas\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what are we doing about them? What's the technology that's being deployed and will be deployed\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, right now, I think, that the airlines have been asked to pull back their schedule a little bit in the New York area because of the demand, because of some of the issues that they have going on there, they have just recently announced that finally, after about, gosh, it's been about a three year effort, they're moving, I'll just call it the Newark sectors. Out of the New York TRACON, which is known as N90. They're moving that over to the Philadelphia Approach Control. So the Philadelphia TRACON is going to take over the airspace that controls arrivals and departures out of Newark. There's a lot of pushback on that. A lot of it was from controllers that didn't want to relocate. There were some technology issues initially, but those were solved. These are, these is new equipment and it'll play very well. I know this will shock you, but there were also some political issues there, with moving the facility but it sounds like now they're moving in that direction very quickly and they finally made a decision that the move would be completed by the end of June, but this has taken about two years, so nothing happens quickly. All of those airports in New York, as you know, Jim, I'll say surface management there. I'm going to go to that cause I know that area very well, has been a work in progress since what, 2007, 2008. And, what we saw in New York was often flights would taxi out and sit in queues. I have a picture that I still have today. It got my attention because it was at Kennedy Airport and because there had been a runway closure and they were down to a single runway operation and because the system still operated at the time, still does for the most part, on a first come first serve basis, you push back because you don't want to get left behind. You want to first come first serve. There are 63 airplanes in a single taxi queue for the departure runway and because of other issues, many of them sat out there for hours, literally. In some cases, I know of at least one flight, sat out there in the taxi queue for departure, long enough to serve the dinner meal on the aircraft. And that just seemed to be crazy. So, with that, first of all came surface surveillance to know who was out there, to really better understand what was going on. And then, I'll call it, virtual taxi queues, metering aircraft off of the gate. And Kennedy was one of the very first airports to do that. And it was in conjunction with the FAA, the airlines, and the port authority. And what that meant was you would tell the port and the FAA, what time you plan to push back. You provide a pushback time estimate, and then they would give you an actual time that you had to be not, they didn't tell you that you have to push back at this time. They would tell you what time you had to be what the FAA calls is the movement area of the airport. In other words, off of the ramp. Wanting to get onto the taxiway. And they were able to very quickly, within months, dramatically improve taxi times and delays and so forth. And, most important, improve predictability. Because in a pure first come, first served environment, not very predictable. You just go out there and get in a long queue and sit there. There was some work that was planned at LaGuardia. Back in 10 years ago, that didn't happen then. It is starting to happen now through the FAA's Terminal Flight Data Manager program, which is basically surface management, including surveillance and, times, much more accurate We\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>lorne-cass_2_03-29-2024_134854:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>timing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>TFDM is important. I was very much involved in that in my return to the FAA some years ago. Unfortunately, the program, which was, I would say envisioned in the 2005, 2006 area, and actually signed off on the concept was signed off in 2011 2012, because again of these interruptions in budget, where it was originally planned to be pretty much rolled out and ready by the early 20s. Several airports around the country, a long list of them, quite honestly, now is probably going to be 10 years delayed, and I worry about that because I worry about some of the technology in this program, it will probably be obsolete by the time the program is rolled out, but it will still make a difference compared to not having it. That's for certain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the quantifiable value of TFDM surface management is so significant. The return on investment was so high. But, Luka was asking one of our guests recently about the role of, gates and the role of surface. And so, there was some, I remember once at an investor conference and the CEO said, I don't have an air traffic problem. I have a gate problem. What did he mean by that? I As it relates to increasing the throughput of his, the number of passengers going into an airport.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, if you operate on time and at some airports, let's say you own gates, let's say and pick an airline and I own 10 gates at an airport. I'm responsible for those gates. So if I have a disruption, let's say I've got a flight that has a maintenance issue and is not going to depart the gate at two o'clock is scheduled. It's not going to be able to leave until three or later, but I have an arrival that needs a gate or that gate. I've got to figure out what I'm going to do. Am I going to move that aircraft off the gate? Am I going to try to arrange for another gate? How do I handle that? But I own it, so I can make those decisions. In some cases, I may have an airport where I'm leasing gates from the airport authority. Let's say I have those same ten gates, they're leased, and those are the gates I have to use. I may be able to use another gate that is suitable for my aircraft on another terminal or maybe down the road from where I am, down the terminal from where I am, and maybe I won't be able to do that. So gates are huge and understanding for the airline using some of the data that we have started to collect, for example, through TFDM with this, I'll call it the virtual taxi queuing, estimated off blocks times, for example, maybe have a better idea how my gate availability is going to occur. But I have to plan that for, and there's a whole bunch of reasons. It can't just take any gate sometime because maybe any gate doesn't work well for me in handling the aircraft when it's on the ground. Maybe it doesn't work well for my customers that have close connections. I don't want to be over in Terminal D when my customers have close connections in Terminal A. So I've got to be able to manage that. So gates are critical. Some of the newer technologies that are out there, including a couple that have been developed in house, take the gate availability into the mix of the overall schedule and overall irregular ops recoveries and so forth. And that's a huge deal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's so important for people to understand this level of complexity in the air, on the surface, and at the gate, and the number of different technologies that are used. The information sharing that takes place, and actually, frankly, the role of some really small companies that are making great innovations in this area. So for those that are listening, you're hearing an industry expert talk about great opportunities for optimization and improvement, and some are doing a good job today, but there's a lot of opportunity for technology deployment here, isn't there, Lorne?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, there is. and there is a lot of it being deployed. And I would say those that have the expertise, there's a lot of opportunity out there. And I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in the new world of AAMs. If you think about, what they're going to need to do. And if you think about a VertiPort operation, that's going to have to be another one of those things, because I know it's hard to believe, but, your operation is not going to be operating exactly as you planned every day. Some days it'll work really well and other days it won't. And you may end up showing up at the VertiPort when there's no, no place for you to park. So all those things have to be factored in.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lorne, you were known in the industry as somebody who, if you want to bring new technology to an airline, see Lorne first. And then what advice would you give to our entrepreneurs? There's billions here to be saved and to be optimized with more efficient operations. And then you can imagine the opportunities with Advanced Air Mobility coming online. What advice would you give to, to an organization that they think they have a pretty good technology and they've been told to go see Lorne Cass to see, how should I really bring this to market? What advice would you give them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, call me and I'll tell them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:28\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, right, right,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Okay. Okay. Fair enough. again, going back to, they've got to develop a relationship with the operator of this particular vehicle and learn from what they're doing. And when you're talking about to the new entrant operators, you need to use some of the things that have been learned in the airline world and the airline world is still learning and has a lot to learn yet, like many other businesses, but it is done much better at using available capacity that it has control of. And I put that's important, but it needs to have a better understanding of the stuff I can control as the operator and things I can't control, like I said, as soon as my vehicle moves, everything is, think of it this way, the airline industry is deregulated. I put that in, in, in quotes. And the AAM operator, for example, eVTOL operator is also going to be quote unquote deregulated. But the fact is as soon as you put that vehicle into the airspace, you are in a highly regulated environment and anything that you can help the operator learn about different constraints that are going to impact the operation that will allow him to operate more efficiently in that highly regulated environment from takeoff to touchdown is going to be very important. In addition to that, you need to pull in all the things around that airport operation or vertiport operation, whatever it is, but go to them. And first of all, as I said, listen, ask them what they think they need. Ask them how they use tools today that they might be able to use in this new AAM world. I'm talking about if you go talk to the airlines, but I think it's going to be an important place to go and understand how they manage this and you're going to have to help them because, there's going to be a need for clear rules of responsibility and lines of authority and accountability. You have to help them with those things and I can't repeat that enough. Remember, responsibility, authority and accountability is going to be required by not only the FAA, but by your customers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:15:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the common frustrations that we hear from people who are trying to push new technology into the airline industry even for things that are relatively easy to fix, the lower hanging fruit around air traffic management, everybody broadly recognizes that there is, maybe an opportunity to improve the efficiency of the overall system by 10, 15 percent perhaps. But the common frustration is that you're dealing with so many different stakeholders, different nations, integration with IT systems that are very fragmented, that are very old, very fragile, and hence you're talking to an audience that doesn't really have the appetite to, change things. In fear of risking potentially even a worse outcome. What strategies, what kind of advice would you have for those people to circumvent some of those issues?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:16:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, those are big issues and I do think that, the new operator, the AAM, if you will. I think that they're going to start off, in my opinion, the starting role for them is going to be in serving, I think, high value customers of a given airline or airlines. And I think that's going to mean more of the stuff that's going to be fairly close in, pretty well defined, in the longer term, when you get to the vehicles with a higher capacity and range, then I think, some of that regional operation makes sense as well. So, I think the, and I heard Mr. Rinaldi say the same thing and I agree with him. I think now some of the operators those that are getting closer to operating, recognize that you're going to have to go in and use the ATC system as it exists today to start. That means you're going to be flying things like helicopter routes and so forth. As you prove your operation on those routes to yourself to your, local airport, vertiport, whatever it is, to the FAA and to your customer and show that you can operate those reliably, then I think there'll be an opportunity to expand. There's airspace today that, that could be utilized. The other thing I think that I do believe has to be looked at is at the airport itself, if you're operating to or from an airport or a vertiport, you have to fully understand what it's going to take to turn the vehicle. You also have to understand irregular operations. And so, for example, if your vehicle carries four people and has a payload of, a thousand pounds, you're going to be right at max, pretty much and then most of these vehicles are electric. so range is important, and I see some that advertise a range of X number of miles. But I look at them and think, gee, what kind of reserves do I have? Because the operation is not running the way I thought it was going to run and I'm delayed, I'm behind, or I have to divert because of some issue. what can I recover this vehicle if I divert to some other place? How does that work? So I think there are a lot of things, the operators themselves, the OEMs and the operators, in many cases, it'd be one and the same initially from what I can see. I think they have to take all that into account. And maybe they are and maybe they're not. But I, there's things I worry for example, about icing. I hear many operators say, we won't fly into icing. My response is, yes, you will. And you have to be prepared for that and understand how your vehicle's gonna deal with it. And there's just other things for customers and so forth. I thought, Jim, that the gent you had on that was talking about the G Force as an elevator design, how that might impact the eVTOL world. And I thought that those are the types of things that have to be thought of.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:19:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's terrific.

So, I think it's important to these new operators to get involved as they can in the world of CDM, in the world of standards, be in the room and many of them are, but get in the room and work on things like standards are going to be very important. And standards are not good standards unless they're built by consensus and collaboration. And I think that there are several different standards organizations that you should go out and get involved with. because I think that will help you. And when you go into those meetings, by the way, whether you're in a standards organization or you're at a CDM meeting or something similar, or even going and sitting in on one of the Advanced Aviation Advisory Committee meetings in the audience, you're going to learn, you're going to learn from other people in the room, and realize that you don't know everything and go listen to some others that have some experience in the arena or have been there before\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And you're going to be seen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Lorne:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And you're going to be seen.

Part 135/ Part 380 was deliberately designed by the FAA and DOT together to allow for a semi-scheduled service under 30 people. That was deliberately done that way. If you look at all the safety inputs there, they are as safe as, if not better than, Part 121 air carriers. And the whole system is under attack now, because lo and behold, the Part 121 regulation was designed to favor the incumbent, and to really keep out innovation in this space. And so I think the next 18 months are going to determine whether this is it for commercial air travel in the U.S. or whether we're going to still have space for novel ideas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Welcome back to The Vertical Space. In today's episode was sit down with Uma Subramanian, a seasoned aviation expert with a wealth of experience in industry. Having known Uma for many years, we've been really eager to bring her insights to our audience. From her time as an engineer, working on F-18s to doing corporate development and strategy at Rolls Royce, to leading the urban air mobility network Voom, an Airbus company to being the founding CEO of Aero, an airline catering to premium passengers from March 2019 to September 2023, Uma truly brings a unique perspective to the table. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics from the genesis of Aero and the economics of running an airline to the challenges and opportunities in the ever evolving aviation industry. One particularly contentious topic that we explore is the ongoing debates surrounding Part 135 and Part 380 regulations sparked by the success and recent public discourse around JSX. Throughout our discussion, we delve into the intricacies of airline operations, exploring questions, such as the right strategies for profitable growth, the role of labor in shaping airline policies and the regulatory structures that either hinder or foster innovation in air travel. We also touch upon the exciting developments in electric aviation, and the potential for regional air services in the U.S. shedding light on the future of aviation and the path forward for industry innovation. Uma is the managing director of Surya Ventures, a mobility advisory firm. From 2019 through 2023, Uma was the CEO of Aero Technologies, a next generation air carrier for the experience economy. Prior to launching Aero, Uma was the founding CEO of Voom.Flights an Airbus company, which ran on demand air taxi services in Sao Paulo and Mexico City. Uma holds an undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan and an MBA from Harvard Business School. Uma is passionate about flight and has spent the majority of her career working in aerospace and aviation. Uma believes that this is an extraordinary time in the industry and looks forward to building the future of flight. So join us as we unpack the complexities of starting and running an airline, navigate the economics of air travel and explore the fascinating intersection of innovation and regulation in aviation, right after a brief sponsor message.

And I believe that it is possible to do something radically different. And I believe it's possible to do something radically different while building a profitable business. But you have to be really deliberate in what you do, in order to radically change the paradigm.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Uma, how did you end up starting an airline? what drove you into that direction?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you, Jim, for the question. So, my history and passion for aviation go way back. I went to space camp when I was nine and became obsessed with all things aviation and aerospace. I have an undergrad degree in aerospace engineering, and right outta college, worked on the F 18 program doing stress engineering in the aft fuselage, which if you know me is not a good career choice. I am, not the engineer's engineer, so quite quickly I pivoted, and managed to finagle my way onto what was then Project Constellation, which was, the US' Moon Mars program. And I spent three sort of very happy years building or articulating a future for space travel, that, that was very exciting. It was about how does, how do we tend to send people to the moon? How do we send people to Mars? What is the right crew mix look like? And so had a really deep and intrinsic look at the space industry. And what I concluded there was that, space is really amazing, but things take a really long time. So I went to business school, and had some exposure into how do you make, how do people make decisions about what businesses to start and why. and found myself realizing that if ever I wanted to do something that moved at pace in the aerospace sector, it would have to be in aviation. And aviation is at the cutting edge, and very real to customers today. So I worked for Rolls Royce, in the military engine business and then, After a few kind of loops went and worked at Airbus where I started Airbus's first urban air mobility business, which was a network business that moved people in helicopters as a precursor to the urban air mobility revolution and learned in that process about how do you make money in the aviation space. And so when you were talking about the aviation space and, it becomes quite clear that you must be the operator to make money in aviation. there is very little margin for a network player. And so in March of 2019, I met Garrett Camp, who is the founder of Uber. And Garrett said to me, I want to do something in aviation. I believe fundamentally that the commercial air travel experience sucks and private's unaffordable. and I wanna start something. now Garrett had the experience of Uber, and was very interested in doing something asset light. And having had the experience at Airbus of running an asset light helicopter network, I made the point to him that you must be the operator in order for any of these models to work because the value accrues to the operator. And so with that as a thesis, we started, we built a super premium semi private brand, called Aero, that was about delivering a radically better passenger experience with economics that made sense. So we took Embraer Regional Jets, which had fallen out of favor with the commercial carriers, stripped them down to 16 seats, and started operating on, on routes, both in the US and in Europe. Now in, in aviation timing is everything. so we launched an airline six months before COVID and Brexit and financial crisis. so I genuinely believe that we managed to build something, despite the sort of really strong headwinds. and there is a very interesting model here because what we discovered is that there is a segment of people that really do care about the air travel experience, and there is an opportunity to build something that is radically better but you have to be really deliberate in how you do that, and what routes you choose, and how you go to market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you looked at space and you looked at aerospace overall, and you saw that aviation is where the excitement is and where you wanted to spend your time. And then you started looking at aviation and then you saw that being the operator is the way to be able to make the money. Can you talk a little bit about the economics of that? Why the operator and how did you reach that conclusion?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And even before that, Uma, if you don't mind clarifying what exactly you mean by running a network as opposed to being an operator.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>you, Luka.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so, there is a popular thesis that percolates around Silicon Valley every five or ten years, where if you go and look at any small regional airport, there's a lot of jets sitting on the ground. And what is a thesis that just keeps popping up is, Hey, I see a lot of excess capacity and I can make that capacity available in a way that allows, so I will build a network, right? So this was the Jetspotter model and operate other people's airplanes and allow them to operate profitably. This is the Blade model where they work with operators to run their network.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>and The challenge with that is that the economics in that don't really make sense, right? So the cost per hour to operate an aircraft comes down the more hours you fly. And so as the operator, you are, and this is why airlines sweat their assets, right? so an average airline will operate its asset between 3600 and 4000, hours a year per asset. But Charter operators only fly 400 to 800 hours, which is why charter flights are so expensive on a per hour basis, because they're covering their costs. And the thesis around, like, putting those charter operators in service more through a network play, basically implies that you can build a cost structure that's more efficient. But time and time again, what people have found is is that's actually really difficult to do because there is a, there's a ceiling on willingness to pay on a per hour basis that makes the economics not quite sort out. Does that answer the question?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So that answered the question a little bit of the operator versus the network, I guess, but I'm also assuming you're saying vis a vis the OEM as well, you're saying that this is where the money is versus being an OEM is my guess, is what you're saying. Is that right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, those are radically different businesses. and so being an OEM, so I'm talking purely about the air operations space. So how do you make money with assets once you already have them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, great. So, and can you just talk a little more detail about the economics of being the operator that brought you to your conclusion?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so, an operator, has classic fixed and variable costs, right? And the fixed costs are the depreciation of the aircraft, labor is often a fixed cost, insurance is a fixed cost on a per aircraft basis. and so you, you go through the stack bar build up on the fixed costs, and then the variable costs are really important. So there's also variable labor. there is fuel, which is a big one, and on a per flight hour basis, and then there's a maintenance reserve, which you carry on a per flight hour basis. So when you have many more hours over which to spread your fixed cost, your cost on a per hour basis can weigh out. And so if you don't operate your asset that much, you have to cover those fixed costs on, over 400 hours, right? And that tends to be the biggest driver.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so when you were running VOOM, as that, first experience with an operator, was VOOM exclusively operating its own aircraft or were you running a network and had some other operators on that network or was it a hybrid approach?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>VOOM was exclusively just the network. So that's a great example. So, the VOOM cost stack shook out as, on a 100 ticket. So say a passenger pays, we operated in Sao Paulo, Mexico City. So say a passenger were to pay 100 to fly from Guadalupe Airport to Itaim. So, Seventy five of those dollars went to the operator. Fifteen dollars went to the helipads at either side. About another five dollars went to air traffic control in Sao Paulo. And then the last five dollars is the margin that the network has. And a lot of times that margin is even less. So if you look at the cases of like JetSmarter, or, or some of the bigger network plays that didn't work out, BlackJet, DayJet. When I started Aero I had a long list of like dead players in this space. Often times there wasn't margin for the network, which is why that model doesn't work.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, what were the key learnings you took from the VOOM experience that proved the most helpful and relevant as you, were building Aero?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Steve Jobs had that phrase, you can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking back. When I look back, I couldn't have done Aero without having done Voom, because I didn't know how to build an operation, right? And going through the VOOM experience and working with operators and really, like, learning about the pieces that needed to come together, taught me how to go build an air operation, right? Like, I knew that I needed to go out and get a Part 135 ticket. I know I needed to go out and file for Part 380 in order to have commercial authority to fly in the U. S. What post holders you need and how to actually go do that. How do you procure an aircraft and like, do go through all those things. And that's what I learned getting to this, getting to the point where we started Aero.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you started out with Aero, did you have one vision for, how it would grow profitably and what would be the right strategy? and did the experience, slightly change that or change that in some big ways as you got deeper into it and began operations with Aero? What came out of that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So, so Aero is still running. It is, serving passengers between Los Angeles and Cabo and Aspen, profitably. And when we started out, we had a huge vision to bring Semi private premium air travel to both Europe and the U. S. and they always say like if you had a do over, what would you do? And I think I would do less. I think what I learned building Aero is that it's really important to focus and like really nail it in one geography, and go from there. But you know, we got a lot of things right. We built a wonderful product. We had, we had five airplanes with 16 seats in them. That was a beautiful experience. and we found some routes that had a lot of traction. in hindsight, there's some routes that make a lot of sense, like New York, South Florida is a route that is a really compelling premium travel route. There's a lot of opportunities, sort of Canada, South Florida, up and down the eastern seaboard is really compelling. The West Coast has different travel patterns, and oftentimes you need longer range, so I probably would have started on the East Coast, with the airplanes that I had. But there's very clearly a market for the premium traveler that needs to be addressed in a different way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So your conclusions from your earlier work led you to believe that there's an opportunity in aviation, there's an opportunity to be the operator, and, your next professional Step forward was you're trying to prove out this opportunity. Let me ask you, who today is taking advantage of what you see as the greater opportunities in the market? What kind of operators?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I think that, so JSX is doing a really nice job on, the, the, Medium premium market, right? So not the wealthy end of the market, but the sort of large bell curve around like the middle class, with discretionary income traveler, right? and it's doing a really nice job of delivering to that person a radically better experience. At the premium end, Aero's product offering is beautiful. We have very kind of reliable customers, that fly us really regularly. And then, at a global scale, Vista has a semi private offering that's also quite a good offering. but I don't think anyone has really nailed it. Like I think there's really an opportunity here, to do something different, but you'd have to do it, you'd have to pick the right launch markets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Talk about that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so I think, one of the, one of the things is, So we set out with a thesis that we were serving leisure travelers primarily, instead of going after really high density markets. but high density markets are where travelers feel the most pain around the travel experience, right? So the New York, Florida commuters are the ones that have to suffer through the airport and often will choose to fly private instead. So you can pick off that as an opportunity. the other market that I feel is a really compelling place to start something like this is in Europe, where I don't know if any of you have been through Heathrow lately, but last time I was flying to Frankfurt, it was two and a half hour queues, in the mornings. And so the beauty of the European market is because most of the airports are within three hours of, well I'll use the London example, three hours of London a product like the one that we built, with the reconfigured ERJs would be optimal for that market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Uma, when you say, you're not going to have LHR, you're flying out of Gatwick or you're flying and is it the airport and is it potentially the FBO that's changing the dynamics of the experience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so when we were in Europe, we flew out of Farnborough, which was the, private airport. So we ran, scheduled charter, out of Farnborough. And that was a dramatically different experience because you show up to fly internationally 20 to 45 minutes before the flight, and it's a dramatically better experience. and there's no kind of complications of Interestingly enough, in Europe, they have airport security because you're going on an international flight. So you still have to clear security, but it's a very sort of seamless, painless kind of process.

S. market again, there are two ways to characterize the gap in the market, between existing commercial air service and flying private. one of them is, as you've pointed out, there is a less painful, somewhat more premium. service offering that sits between the quality level of the commercial airline experience and flying private. the other one that I'd love to get your thoughts on is the regional airline, air service opportunity, which, 50 years ago in this country, that was a viable business model and, it fell away. It was no longer economic, but commercial air transport today, serves a relatively small fraction of the airports in the country. And when you look at that opportunity, that may not be a, a premium type of service, but is there a window, the way the industry is structured and the way the requirements are structured, for offering that type of service again, in your opinion?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's probably worth delving into why that model went away. so if we think back kind of 20 years ago, right, we had. Continental and U. S. Air, and Northwest Airlines and, before that, Eastern and, Piedmont and all sorts of other kind of air carriers, that were operating in a tightly regulated market, right? And then the airlines went towards deregulation and the sort of hub and spoke model evolved. But what is really complex, and this is controversial, is that the airlines are really beholden to labor. and labor costs keep going up, right? And big structural changes like, ALPA forcing first officers to have a minimum of 1, 500 hours drives labor costs for the airlines way, way up. And if you look at kind of recent transactions in the aviation space, right? Like typically airlines trade a two to three X revenue. But there's an example of a transaction going through now, the Alaska Airlines buying out Hawaiian, where Hawaiian's revenue last year was 3. 2 billion, and they're selling for less than one times revenue, inclusive of debt, right? And that's bananas. That basically says that airlines are inherently, like, value destroying, right? Because you don't even trade at 1x revenue, it's just crazy. And if you look at what their cost drivers are, their fixed costs are extremely high. They, they've got, Part 121 drives you to carry a lot of, surplus, like, very redundant, Kind of very high employee levels, really high fixed costs, and then your variable costs are extremely high, because, on a per hour basis, you're having to spread your pilot costs, and it's just, it's prohibitively expensive to run an airline at scale, right? And so, what we saw in the U. S. happen was, lots and lots of consolidation. And so you've ended up with six transcontinental carriers that operate on razor thin margins. And it's a fundamental kind of structural question, right? and this is, I would argue that the root cause of all of this is, entirely labor. We are beholden to the demands, of labor. And if you look at, at the big carriers are having to pay 600 grand a year for a long haul captain. That kind of cost structure just makes it prohibitively expensive across the airline to operate really efficiently. So you asked the question about can regional travel come back. It depends, right? So right now for the FAA, it has not been a priority to serve these lower cost markets, right? In principle, Part 380 and Part 135 were very deliberately designed to continue to allow access to these markets. So Part 135 carriers are allowed to have, first officers with 500 flight hours, right? That brings the whole cost of the system down. And so you can actually have Regional Carriers, and there's a lot of misinformation circulating about the safety of these things where they're, they've lumped in all Part 135 carriers, not just those carriers operating under Part 380. And if you look at the safety records of the Part 135 carriers operating under Part 380, what you'll find is that they are oftentimes better than the Part 121 carriers. Like, there's been a series in the last few weeks of very high profile incidents with big Part 121 carriers that you don't see with Part 135 carriers. It's, it's noteworthy, in that ALPA and, the big airlines that are going after Part 380 are using safety as a use case when it's a bit, it's a pot calling the kettle black.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Why is it over these years that labor has gained such leverage over the airlines? I mean, clearly you point out that they have and, I, I think we can see that, beyond just that immediate leverage over the airline itself, they're able to use that to, exert influence over the structure of the industry and over the constraints by which, other models like Part 135 with Part 380 are able to operate.

I think some of this is driven by, like, the FAA, as has come out lately, right, is quite significantly understaffed. and so they are not able to, really ask the more nuanced questions about, like, what happens if I strip these things back.

But the autonomy, is a great solve for this problem, right? Pilots are getting older. There is a dearth of pilots in the pipeline, which is how they're able to extract, materially higher labor costs. There's far fewer pilots coming out of the military, which used to be a source of, of pilots for the US air carriers. And, I think autonomy will definitely move us forward in that space. So I think you're starting to see, a clear definition of the path, right? So it will never go to full autonomy right off the gate. You'll probably go for, potentially single pilot with a remote kind of override, and then eventually over time might move in that direction. But, But autonomy is definitely kind of part of the long term equation here. But in the short term, I think, we're really stuck, right? We're stuck with sort of six, behemoths, in the U. S. anyway, right? Six behemoths, that are offering transcon service., And then lots of people have started small airlines. So, so the best one, is Andrew Levy's Avelo right now. And he posted recently that they turned a profit. That's a brand new, low cost carrier that's going after these secondary markets. and, the, the thesis there, so he was at Allegiant before that. and the thesis there is like, run, run your airplanes full, offering low cost service to tier two and tier three cities, which is also what Breeze is doing. and then the premium customer, like both of these offerings, no one is solving for the premium customer, right? This is what we were trying to solve for, which is offer a better product at a more premium price to serve, the premium customer in a better way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, Avelo was right down the road from us in New Haven. Boy, those things are packed. I mean, it's a nice service they're providing that's relatively affordable to great cities. So, I can understand why they're being successful. Hey, can I ask a quick question? So, let's line up your airline operation next to the 121 and talk about the main cost differences. Why are you able to be a more profitable operation from the cost side and from a revenue side? Your pilot costs are different because you don't have the same requirements. Also talk about the airside and the landside costs. Because I would assume being out of an FBO, you're providing, well, you're definitely providing a better experience. What's the cost difference?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the theory here, Jim, is that, operating, under part 135 allows you to go into smaller airports, right. You can go into airports that are not part 139 airports that are often less expensive to serve. and so you're going in as a charter operator, right, into these airports. and those airports are materially cheaper to operate to and from. so that's one big cost driver. you have, pilots that are on Certified flight instructors, who are working their way, up the ladder, accruing hours and so there's a delta on pilot costs. You're nominally operating out of FBOs, which are expensive, so that's probably a wash relative to operating out of airports. But the two main drivers are, you've got efficiencies on the airports that you go in and out of, so like the airport landing fees are lower, and you're really driving, in the JSX example, for instance, you're really, working with high caliber, pilots that are not yet, part 121 certified.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>27:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And you're able to charge a premium for what reasons?

But more importantly, it was really about service. So, I don't know if any of you have tried to get an airline on the phone lately. it's like nearly impossible to actually talk to a live human. Whereas at Aero, we answered every phone call. And that, in and of itself, right, that's not to do with the flight experience. But that Just having real time customer service gives it a look and feel of a premium carrier.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think there's something really valuable that the customers recognize is that it's a more civilized experience. It's quieter in the terminal, it's quieter when you're flying, you aren't just overwhelmed with all of the boilerplate announcements that they're making. You don't have the same sort of treatment in terms of, getting through security. those little things I think add up to a really different experience on the part of the passenger and a different sort of emotional approach to, even undertaking air travel in that case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's no longer a chore. So what we found is like people love flying with us. So we flew a lot of really high profile folks that, for whatever reason can't fly, commercial. And their choice that they were making was to trade down from private and fly aero, because they were getting functionally the same experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When we, look at the opportunity in the market for offering this premium service, and we see that there's a gap in today's air transportation options, looking at the inputs to this, whether there's new technology that's going to be brought to bear or not. From a structural standpoint, do you see that, looking at the way the regulations are structured under, with Part 121 versus Part 135 operating, in Part 380, do you see a big window for businesses to come into this segment of the market? Or is it really a constrained sort of tiny little knothole that they have to get through in order to make this work. What's your sense from the experience you've had?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's a great question, Pete. I think, Part 135 and the Part 135, Part 380 structure is under attack, and I would argue very unfairly. Part 135, Part 380 was deliberately designed by the FAA and DOT together to allow for, a a semi-scheduled service under 30 people. That was deliberately done that way. if you look at, all the safety inputs there, they are as safe as, if not better than, Part 121 air carriers. And the whole system is under attack now, because lo and behold, the Part 121 regulation was designed to favor the incumbent And to really keep out innovation in this space. And so the next 18 months are going to be super critical for the future of U. S. Aviation. We're in trouble on the OEM side because the structure of the industry allowed for basically only one OEM at scale, right? Because, if you look back 50 years, right, on the aircraft manufacturing side, we had Lockheed and Grumman and McDonnell and Douglas and Boeing, everyone was building passenger aircraft. But as the safety requirements ramped up and as the certification got more and more onerous, as the cost went through the roof to actually bring a product to market, very few companies could sustain that cost. And so, so they were allowed to kind of all merge together and you ended up in the problems that you've got now with Boeing. It is becoming like that in the commercial aviation space. Like, there are these six carriers, and then you've got Avalo and Breeze that have just started, that are competing. And there is not a will, both politically and in the industry, to allow innovation in this space. And so I think the next 18 months are going to determine whether this is it for commercial air travel in the U.S or whether we're going to still have space, for novel ideas and for people to come and serve this premium traffic in a different way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's say that you have the opportunity that even though there's an onslaught right now, let's say that it's a positive outcome. What's the size of the market? Is it a sliver of what the commercial aviation market is today? What percentage is this market the commercial market today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>32:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good question. So when we went through the exercise of sizing the market, we said that commercial air travel was in 2019, a 900 billion market, right? So that included all the airlines globally, plus the charter operators that were, that were, that published results. And that did not include like people that own their own aircraft. So if you assume it's 900 billion, right? And you assume that a third of that is leisure travel, right? So we were specifically targeting premium leisure travelers. one third of that is leisure travelers. And of that. One another third are premium leisure travelers. You ended up with a market size of about a hundred billion dollars globally. So it's not a tiny market. it's a large enough market. So it is fair to say that 30 percent of all air travelers are premium air travelers. So if you look at the kind of total market globally, you're talking about 900. If you remove the sort of leisure filter, you're talking about a 300 billion market. It's a big market. These are people that pay for business class fares.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Uma If the premium travel segment is where the opportunity exists today, do you think that the maturation of technologies enabling electric aircraft is a lever strong enough to create the opportunity for all of the other non-premium travel segments as well?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, so I think, we should look at the evolution of electric aviation. So, so best in class batteries today are about 240 watt hours a kilogram, right? So with batteries that are not super power dense, all of the aircraft configurations that we're looking at today are for small, kind of four, four pax max airplanes. And we need, so at Airbus, we looked at a lot of different scenarios and universally concluded that to have aviation, regional scale aviation, which is the point at which this starts to make sense, you need 800 to 1000 watt hours a kilogram on power density, right? So you have to have radically better batteries. That's the point at which electric aviation becomes material, where you can have regional scale electric aviation. And, so I don't know, like, there's a lot of people working on very small, very lightweight, electric airplanes. And that's fine for sort of the city commute or the suburban commute. But to have regional aviation at scale, we're a long way off. So then you ask the question, what happens, if you have, airplanes that have regional scale range, you still end up in this problem around the operator, right, because, the operating rules determine where you'll be able to operate those aircraft, right? So if the resolution around Part 135 is favorable and it says, hey, you can continue to operate up to 30 seats. Then all of a sudden, it's a really interesting game, right? So, so there is a, a technology maturation. So in 10 years, right, when batteries get materially better and you can have an aircraft that gives you regional scale range, if Part 135, Part 380 are still alive, then you have a framework for potentially new electric aviation air carriers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. And Uma, we're circling around this part 135, 121, 380 discussion. Do you mind taking us a layer deeper into, what's currently the hot topic discussion and maybe a little bit more, on the privileges for each of those.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so it's probably worth backing up a second. So, so Part 121 is the FAA denomination for the operating license, right? So Part 121 carriers are airlines that have to operate out of Part 139 airports that, have to go through TSA and are what we think of as an airline. Part 135 are air charter operators, that operate with DOT Part 380 economic authority that allows them to run on a semi schedule, right? So you can basically run flights, and the goal here is to serve city payers multiple times a day. So you get a Part 135 air carrier, that's your authority to operate. And then you get DOT Part 380, which is your economic authority. And then you get what's called commuter authority on top of that from the DOT, which allows you to operate multiple, like more than four and a half times a week between any city pair. So that's what we're talking about. So this structure was designed very deliberately about 25 years ago during this period of consolidation that Peter talked about earlier. And the goal there was to create a mechanism that would allow service continuity to smaller regional airports, right? And with the goal being that these places don't lose service as you, as the airline industry consolidates. So, so recognizing that those airports have different economics than the kind of major cities. So, so that's the macro structure. And so what's currently under threat is that the Part 380 structure and Part 135 carriers operating on a semi schedule, has proven really popular with consumers. People are choosing to fly, JSX is the biggest one, but services like JSX and Contour and Aero, and are flying under Part 380, on a sort of semi schedule, and people love the service, because they get to fly out of private terminals, and it's a much more sort of seamless experience. And right now, that structure is, is under threat because these services have proved wildly successful. And, and my personal view is that this is, again, the airlines monopolizing to ward off competition. and using the guise of safety to do that. So they're basically claiming that these services are less safe because, first officers only have 500 hours, which as we know is just nonsense. and if you actually look at the data being presented, the data is being skewed in a way that is not accurate. So they are lumping all operators together. And there is a very different, it is a, there's a very, there's a dramatic difference between operators whose livelihoods depend on really delivering a safe and reliable operation with some volume and other operators that, operate one aircraft on a, on an inconsistent basis. And so if you look at, if you look at, at what's happening now, so there's really an interest in trying to get, both the FAA and the DOT to reverse their position vis a vis Part 380 and Part 135 right now. And there's a lot of pressure on the industry to do so. but So, it's not fully clear how this is going to shake out because on one side you have JSX and other operators like, like Contour, and supporting them, you've got United and JetBlue, and then on the other side, opposing them and when viewed with an anti competitive lens, you've got Alpa and American Airlines and Southwest. So this is really going to be a philosophical issue that the FAA is going to need to resolve about whether it wants to allow for, for competition in this space and for new novel experiences that radically benefit the customer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you addressed their safety argument, as they attack this, I've also read that they're using security as another, vector for attacking the model.

So the carriers in general, do explosive swabbing on luggage, but the beauty of the Part 135 structure, right, is that the cockpit door is locked and because these, at least those services that are currently in existence, don't have overhead bins, you don't, you're not able to carry a lot of, of hand luggage on board.

Essentially, nobody builds airplanes that are fewer than 60 seats anymore. And this is because we've had massive consolidation in the number of airlines, and airlines want bigger aircraft that they run fewer times between the same O and D pairs, right? So they're solving for bigger airplanes. So, Embraer stopped making the ERJ in like 2012, and then Bombardier has basically stopped making the CRJ. And so there are no aircraft that are under really 50 seats anymore that are coming to market except for these electric airplanes. So Heart Aerospace has an aircraft that they're purporting will be, 30 seats, and people are looking at smaller electric airplanes. But one big kind of question for us is, like, where will we get capacity for smaller aircraft, right? So, this is where taking kind of old private jets and converting them. so you basically, you take out the existing seat configuration. Maybe you take out the D VAN and put in more seats, is the most likely path.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Uma, how does an airline differentiate other than routes, the customer experience?

You buy, like, other than being loyal. So I was a very loyal one world, traveler when I worked for Airbus, because I accrued so many miles that it didn't make sense to fly anything other than one world. Mileage programs are the single biggest source of competitive advantage for any of the carriers. Once you're, once you have a customer and they're very loyal with you, that's the way. But our thesis with Aero, we didn't have a loyalty program. We sold a lot of tickets because we offered a radically better product. And our customers repeated a lot, right? So people, even without a loyalty program, our average passenger has flown Aero three or four times. And that's, and like, and we had served very few routes, right, between Aspen and Cabo, so depending on how often you need to go to Aspen and Cabo. But you can imagine as we build out those routes that passengers love the product, and they love the service, and they would rather fly a better product than, than fly with a carrier that they may have miles with.

So, there is a huge opportunity on getting parts where they need to be when they need to be there. and There's an enormous opportunity around 3D printing that I think is interesting. So, there's PMA parts that are, parts that are form, fit, and function equivalent to OEM parts that are made by third party vendors. Equally, imagine a 3D printing Opportunity, around creating PMA parts, that I think is really interesting. I think if you are going to be an entrepreneur that starts an air carrier of any kind, you need to start with an inordinate amount of capital up front, right? We're talking about at least a couple hundred million dollars up front because starting an airline is very expensive. You have to build an airline before you start operating. And so you need a lot of capital and a lot of resilience because in aviation when anything breaks or anything goes awry, it's hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix, right? And so, raising capital for an airline, like a tech company, is a very hard thing to do. So, if you decide that you want to be an air carrier, plan to start with a lot of cash up front.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you think about, ideas of creating on demand airlines with nine passengers or less that use, optimization algorithms to match supply and demand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is, this kind of goes back to where we started this conversation, which is about being the operator. Truly on demand services, right? You have to look at the only company that did this well, was ExoJet. And under Brad Stewart's leadership, they built a very robust algorithm that would allow Brad to like predictively assess where demand was going to come from for the 50th airplane 60 days from now, right? But that was based on a really robust dataset. Fundamentally, you have to cover your operating costs, every leg, right? And this is why on demand is really hard. Like, on demand, so, so for the, so, why on demand has never really worked before, right? So, say Peter needs to go from San Francisco to Reno, but the jet is in Long Beach, and the jet lives in Long Beach. So the jet has to fly empty Long Beach to San Francisco. Peter flies San Francisco to Reno, and the jet goes back from Reno to Long Beach. Why on demand? That's two deadhead legs for every revenue leg, and you have to cover the cost of those things, right? So the deadhead leg is functionally the same cost as the revenue leg. Right, so you have to be able to charge three times the price of what it would actually like cost you if that airplane was like already on the ground. This is why the on demand problem is so hard to solve. It's because the costs just don't make sense unless you have sufficient capacity and then you're paying for all these airplanes that are just sitting on the ground.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How is the on demand problem cracked though? Do you have any ideas? Is it a matter of, technology? Is it a matter of, I mean, obviously lower operating costs, but, put that aside. Is it about choosing the routes or the areas that you're serving wisely,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I, frankly, I think on, I just don't believe in on demand. Like, I have not yet seen a model that allows you to crack that because you come back to the fundamental problem with aviation, right? So, The reason that asset-light doesn't work is because, let's back it all the way up, OEMs spend billions of dollars certifying a platform. So, whether it's, Bombardier, or whether it's, Cessna. Anyone that's building a new, PJ platform, they are spending billions of dollars certifying a new platform, right? And then they sell a few hundred airplanes. The OEM has to recover all that cost. So where do they make it up? They make some of it up on the sale of the OE, but most of it up on the aftermarket. So your aftermarket parts are very expensive. Like if you break the windscreen of a Dassault Falcon, it's 250 grand to replace, right? And so the air carrier is carrying a huge maintenance reserve for these things. And fundamentally, right, the problem with on demand is that even if you can get better at predicting where the demand comes from, you have to have a fleet that's big enough to actually satisfy that demand, right? This is like the example of Uber paying its drivers in the early days before it had built up the network to such a scale. And then you get to the problem where how many people can actually afford that super premium leg that has to cost three times the three. This is why, aviation tends to end up on a schedule in order to actually make money. Because having the supply in the right place at the right time is very difficult. So, so, Voom when we first started, for about 15 days, we were on demand. And then extremely quickly, we built a schedule where the helicopters left the helipads every half an hour. Because you can't, like, the economics just are not, you don't have the supply base that you have on the ground to actually enable you to do on demand at scale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It really points towards the, the only format where on demand would work is if you had mass produced, small, inexpensive aircraft and or that were extremely cheap to operate deadhead.

Right. Now, the Uber model benefits from the fact that you get dual use out of all the privately owned automobiles. so they have an advantage there, but what this points towards are the very small, electric or, they're not constrained to that propulsion model, but, of the aircraft that are under development, it's going to be at that end of the spectrum that can be mass produced, where you can drive the cost down, you can amortize the certification cost, that have a glimmer of a hope of realizing this model. but it's a big leap to get there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. And I think from like, what we know, right, is anyone literally anyone can build a flying prototype, but to actually industrialize that prototype is a radically different exercise, right? So to build and get type certificate for an airplane and to certify the design processes, there is zero tolerance anymore for, things to be unsafe. And so the safety standards are only going to get harder to satisfy. And so the delta between a flying prototype and a production vehicle. is huge. So you, So, this is why I think the whole model is very difficult. So even the electric VTOL, right? the only sort of short haul regional airline that's ever made money was New York Airways, which was helicopters every 30 minutes from the top of the Pan Am building to any airport. That's the only one that ever made money and it ran for like 20 years and the reason it made money was because it ran on a schedule. Every 30 minutes from the top of the building you could go to any of these airports. And on-demand is such a difficult problem to solve because the underlying asset is very expensive, the operating cost of that asset is very high, and you have to be able to pool demand in a way that's really difficult.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As you look at advanced air mobility, eVTOLs, drone delivery, military drones, where do you see the best opportunities for the entrepreneur?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Uma:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>um, I've met an entrepreneur recently who is working on a 1, 000 watt hour per kilogram battery.

There's the urban commute use case. There's a suburban use case. There's the airport to wherever use case, right? And all of those things are interesting and merit different technical solutions.

Andrew talks about what major steps must be taken with UAS traffic management and U-Space, and that radical steps have to be taken to integrate the airspace. And if we're going to get the high density operations we need an airspace where all aircraft are going to fly together. And if we don't do it, UAS is unlikely to be economically viable. He extensively discusses U-Space. How it started. Where it stands today, the requirements for setting up U-Space, why it's taken so long to implement and how it'll evolve in the future. Something really revealing about Andrew, in my opinion, is his comment early in our discussion, as he says, we wanted to see from the beginning where we wanted to get to in the end. Where in other parts of the world, UTM is being deployed in a slow iterative process, perhaps the most convenient steps, but not the best steps. Andrew wants to design the system from the beginning and the way he envisions it, looking in the end. And that the expedient and the convenient, we'll never get to where we want to eventually be. That was a really good discussion. Another good section is on drone detection. He refers to the categories of the careless, the clueless and the criminal, and how detection has to account for each. He discusses radar acoustic optical radio-based systems and others, and the challenges of detecting noncooperative aircraft. He mentioned that detect and avoid is not a focus of U-Space today. And how U-Space plans do safely separate vehicles. And to that end, we have a great discussion around tactical and strategic deconfliction. He explains that so much as strategic today because he believes they currently don't have any confidence in this surveillance. And then in order to do tactical maneuvers, you need to know where the aircraft are. Listen how Andrew believes manned and unmanned aircraft will be managed in the same traffic management system. And what will become an automatic traffic management system. Yes I agree with Andrew this is certainly where people tend to get a bit anxious, including some who've been on our podcast. We admire his bold albeit controversial approach to the future of traffic management. He talks a lot about commercial organizations or service providers who are providing or plan to provide traffic management functions. Who they are and where they're based and their commercial and business opportunities. He discusses that these are very tough times to be in the service provider business. Because there's not enough flying yet. He says we suffered from a bootstrap problem in this domain that until there's traffic management there won't be flying and until there's flying, there won't be traffic management. So somebody has to get it started and these companies are all hoping it starts soon. It was an absolute delight to speak with Andrew. He's so informed, he's been doing this for a long time, he's extraordinarily articulate and he has a realistic, balanced, yet optimistic view of how UAS and UTM operations will come together and has some clear areas where UAS operations have real and unique value today. Andrew, thanks for joining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our conversation with Andrew Hatley as you innovate and The Vertical Space.

I am from a research background, and I have been looking at this, UTM, U-Space stuff, and I've been thinking from the beginning, where do we want to go eventually? And I see that there are some radical steps that we need to take. And I have had some disagreements with some people, even some quite notable people on Is it worth taking these steps? Are these steps going to be too costly or too difficult? But I would say that if we are going to get to high density of operations, we're going to get to, electric vehicles carrying passengers, then we need to have, an airspace where all of the aircraft can fly together. And that's going to take a revision of flight rules, which might influence the airspace categorization classes, and I think these steps are a bit scary for some people. Some people look at the current situation and say, how do we get there? So, there are a few people in the industry who disagree with me on taking radical steps, and are these steps justified? But I would say if you look at the alternative, we will just never get to the situation where UAS are economically viable if we don't take these steps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is the disagreement due to the fact that people don't necessarily see the additional value prop or is the disagreement in terms of the complexity, both technical and organizational, to pull something like that off?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the disagreement is mostly about how do we make the step. For example, would it involve retraining people or would it involve modifying aircraft and things like that? And there's always this resistance because the initial impact will be so large. And so that, that's why people tend to disagree with me, but I would always argue that not doing this, the impact will be even larger. So at a certain point we have to grasp the nettle and take a difficult decision. So. I know I recently had a disagreement with Maria from EASA about whether or not we could have a UTM system, a U space system, ultimately controlling manned aircraft. And she felt that was perhaps going to be such a difficult step that there wouldn't be support for it in the industry and so on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Maybe it's important to highlight the difference in the definitions between the U. S. and, Europe. Because I'm guessing in the context that you're referring to, UTM is, increasing automation in managing air traffic, as opposed to traffic management of unmanned aerial systems. Is that correct?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So when we started, the term UTM was being used as a general term. Now, the specific implementation in America has quite a defined scope and is a lot less general than the way that we were using the term in the research community. The European version, USPACE, we started to look at that from a research point of view as being ultimately something that would go on to control these eVTOLs and similar things like that. UTM as it has been implemented in the USA is very much about supporting current operations, supporting VLOS flights, and allowing VLOS flights to occur in an airspace where there are possibly VFR flights going on and things like that. I will tend to use the term UTM more in the general sense, meaning any traffic management of unmanned aerial systems. And typically we are looking at this being completely unmanned traffic management or, as unmanned as we can make it, there will always be a need for escalation to a human for obscure corner cases. We've seen this in many forms of automation, but the general operation we expect will be automatic and it will be providing a service. Because it's automatic, it'll be providing a service which is scalable to a very large amount of traffic, and it'll be providing that service very cheaply. So the scope of USPACE is much broader than the current term UTM is used in the U. S., which is really focusing on the current operations of VLOS flights in the most part. I would imagine as, this part 108, is published for consultation in the summer. it may be that the term UTM begins to take on a broader meaning in the USA. Because I think part 108 will push the envelope a bit and push it towards some of the decisions which have already been made in Europe. do you want me to contrast the USPACE and UTM? Would that be helpful?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Great.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So in, in Europe, USPACE is something which is proposed by the regulator and the USPACE service provider has certain obligations towards the regulator. In the USA, the UTM system, all of the responsibility rests with the aircraft operator and the UTM service provider is a subcontractor of the aircraft operator, but all of the liability still rests with the aircraft operator at all times. So the aircraft operator is seeking support, but that's all he gets from the UTM service provider. Whereas in USPACE, the USPACE service provider is something a little bit like an air navigation service provider in that they have their own responsibilities and they are meeting these towards the regulator rather than only towards the aircraft operator.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, if you could, I think there's subtleties to how people disagree with you. Explain a little bit more about, why you are not at the same sheet. So for example, so many people may say there's going to be an iterative approach to UTM or to U space where you may be feeling, I want to go further faster. Others may be also saying, and I'm now I'm cheating a little bit because we talked a little bit about this in advance, you see the ATC piece being integrated much faster into UTM than others would say, and that's clearly getting into a controversial area. So could you dispel it a little bit more?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it comes from, how we started. the group I was working in started looking at, UTM and USPACE. We wanted to see from the beginning where we wanted to get to at the end. Although it will be an iterative process, we didn't want it to be a process in which each step was going to be the most convenient step to take right now, without a view of where the path would lead. And we wanted to see clearly what's the goal, and then work back how do we get there. And if the goal as I see it, is that we end up more or less integrating UTM and current air traffic control then we need to accomplish a number of steps, which are going to be quite difficult. And so I have the tendency to draw attention to these difficult steps right now, when people say we might do these later, or hopefully maybe do these never because they're difficult. And I, I feel if we take that approach. We will have never reached the goal and the benefit that we really would like. So I tend to argue against the expedient and the convenient. And I'm pushing towards difficult steps and for some of these, so for some of my colleagues, these steps really are tough. If we want to qualify, an automatic system as being an ANSP, then we need to learn a lot about how we qualify these systems, what the expectations are. Today, if you look at, an Air Navigation Service Provider, we certify these with reference to the responsibilities of people, with reference to the responsibilities of management, and it's much harder to take that and say, well, how could we implement all of this stuff as software? What's the algorithmic basis on which you could provide these services without a human there? And it, I think there's a lot of worries in the minds of people who have to actually practically do this, which Perhaps they're not pressing on me so hard as I'm in the research domain. it's much easier for me to be a visionary because, well, I won't be alone in trying to implement this for one thing,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you're also advocating, listening carefully. There are people who are beating up their phones right now, I think, listening to what you just said. So you're also advocating some form of automated air traffic control here, which would have less human involvement. So I would assume this is another controversial part of what you're saying, but you may not be saying that, so please explain in more detail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that's where we get to, but it doesn't start like that. So it starts with, we want to fly UAS in the lower airspace. And we would like to do this as cheaply as possible. So we would like to provide, traffic management services mostly on the basis of software. Probably with a human supervisor for these unusual corner cases for escalation in case of an emergency. But for the general running, Software based. Once we have a software based traffic management system, we have the question about what do we do when a manned aircraft wanders in there for whatever reason. If it's a manned aircraft which is expected, for example some helicopter emergency medical service flight, or a manned aircraft which is unexpected, some light aircraft which has had an engine failure, how do we deal with that? And the current approach which What is proposed is to deal with this as an exception, and we will have the UAS move out of the way and the manned aircraft will be treated as an emergency case. But in the longer term, if we're going to do this in a scalable manner, that manned aircraft has to be treated as a routine process. So eventually, we would like the manned aircraft to participate in the traffic management system, which is providing a service for the UAS. So the, I would like that the manned aircraft is filing a plan, and then is being given an authorization, and then is being monitored that it's following its plan. And once we start to do that, we see that we have a system which can be scaled upwards. These, electrically powered, taxi flights, these eVTOLs, passenger carrying operations, which many operators would like to do without a pilot on board, will probably be managed by a similar, UAS traffic management system. In Europe, we expect USPACE to manage these, but they'll be flying a bit higher than the bottom level, 500 feet. They'll be flying up to a few thousand feet. So now we have a situation where this is an airspace where manned aircraft might fly more than just in case of emergency. And again, I would propose that the logical way to do this in a scalable manner would be to integrate the manned and the unmanned aircraft so that they're controlled by the same system, and so that they are able to interact in a safe but integrated way, and that requires that we have an automatic system which is now giving instructions to manned aircraft, not as an exception, and then we need a qualified automatic system, which is capable of safety of life operations and is good enough to do this. I think that's where people begin to get a bit anxious and begin to disagree with me. I want to go too fast. I'm not sure if I do want to go too fast, but I have a clear view of where I want to get to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Andrew, if this is what success looks like ultimately with UTM, can you go in a bit more detail to describe the milestones that will lead to this success? Both on the, technical side, implementation, cultural, organizational. what are all the stakeholders who have a say in this progression?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, so there's quite a few people involved there. So, The first is that we need to be confident that we can do it. So we need the industry, which is producing the systems, to be able to demonstrate that these systems are good enough and have a high enough quality and a high enough, availability and resilience that they are capable of being trusted to do this. The second step is we need to understand how it will be done. And one of the key problems here, which I would like to spend more time working on, is the flight rule. We do not today fly small UAS following either visual flight rules or instrument flight rules. And if you look at the way that ICAO describes airspace classes, they're all described in terms of these two flight rules. So what we need to do is identify a flight rule for the small UAS, and then understand how it can safely interoperate with the existing ones or the existing manned traffic. One option would be that there's a new flight rule that all of the traffic follows, both manned and unmanned. Another option is that we would find a third flight rule which is compatible with the other two in some way. If you look at the descriptions of how, flights are supposed to occur, it is possible to mix visual flight rules and instrument flight rules today. If we had a third flight rule, perhaps we could find a way to mix that. So, we need to understand the operational basis on which the traffic is mixed together. We need to understand the technical basis on which it's done. What are the procedures? Are the systems capable of providing them? We need to convince the regulator that this is going to be safe enough. It should meet the target level of safety. and we need to convince the existing aviation community this approach is going to be acceptable to them. That they are going to certainly not be inconvenienced and hopefully will benefit from this approach. And we're a little bit optimistic on this basis because, studies have shown that current visual flight rules are not really as safe as people believe they might be, and particularly, tests about visual acquisition of the target show that it's quite common that a pilot of a VFR flight doesn't see everything that they, should. So we are hoping that by providing some support, which is being originated to allow, remotely operated aircraft to fly, that we can enhance the experience of pilot onboard aircraft and that way we can get acceptance for these kinds of what would otherwise be really fairly radical changes to the way that the airspace is structured.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the primary benefit of increasing automation in the air traffic management function? Is there mostly a safety argument? Would you say that this is the primary problem that the industry is facing, or is it more about productivity, being able to accommodate greater traffic density, because part of it, and I'd love your thoughts on it as well, the way traffic management is done in Europe is not the same, obviously, as it's done in the U S organizationally, but at the same time, it feels like there is more inefficiencies and please correct me if I'm wrong in Europe because of the fragmented market, and every nation wanting to have that function internally, as opposed to perhaps sharing it among multiple countries. A couple of questions in there, and I know there's a lot to unpack there, but, what comes to mind?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So there, there are several points there, which I'll need to unpack. Yes. The European air traffic management system is quite fragmented and complicated because air traffic management is the, responsibility of sovereign nations. And in the European Union, we have 27. In, in Eurocontrol, we have 41 member states. So each of these is able to operate its airspace as it wishes, but we work together, and you probably know that Europe has a single integrated traffic management system operated by Eurocontrol, the network manager, and we in the network manager, we ensure that each air traffic control center, well, ensure, we aim that each air traffic control center does not suffer from more traffic than it's able to manage. So there is a process, a rolling process every day where the air traffic control centers look at what kinds of effects might influence their ability to manage traffic, weather effects. I mean, weather is a dominant phenomenon in American air traffic management. it's more prevalent here only in the height of summer and winter. But still weather takes a role. You also have, more subtle effects like important football matches or other things like that which cause, increases in the flow of traffic. All of this is discussed every day in a rolling program and then in the network management system we implement delayed takeoff to avoid that there is, too much traffic in the air, more traffic than can be safely managed. So this goes back to the start of the question where you said, is this a, an issue of safety or is it an issue of capacity? Safety is never compromised, but the result is that when we hit a hard capacity limit, the demand cannot be accommodated at the time it would like to be. So, in Europe, we have these take off slots, which are issued for traffic management reasons, and that is quite evident. In the summer months in Europe, quite a number of sectors of the European sky are at the limit. The traffic cannot be increased without quite some evolution in how we manage the traffic. Certainly among the most busy airspaces in Europe is the region above Belgium, which is a crossing point for traffic coming off the Atlantic Ocean, heading to various European airports, and also traffic flying from Scandinavia towards Spain, and so it's a bit of a crossroads there. And in, in the Belgian sectors, the, Maastricht Air, Upper Air Traffic Control Center really is often pushing towards what it can deal with. And the result, unfortunately, is that the aircraft takeoffs have to be delayed. So, continuously in, in European ATM research, we're looking at how can we improve the capacity without compromising the safety. Many of these kinds of questions can be addressed by some of the techniques that we're looking at to use for UAS traffic management. One of the kind of the most basic principles is we've divided the air traffic management world into sectors. Each sector has normally a pair of air traffic controllers, one of them is talking on the radio to the aircraft, he's the executive, the other air traffic controller is coordinating with other sectors, and the limit to how much work they can do is the mental capacity of these two Air Traffic Controllers to think about the number of aircraft in their sector. For a sector where the traffic mostly fly in straight lines, that capacity can be very high. For a sector where the traffic have to be steered towards an airport or something like that, the capacity is much lower. But it's a mental limit. If the system is completely automated, a computer has no mental limit. We can just buy a faster and faster processor or scale it among multiple computers. So the limits become other than mental capacity. And that way we can, develop techniques in UAS traffic management, which will be re applicable in manned traffic management and promise to increase capacity and possibly reduce costs also. And those aims I think will be in the interest of all airspace users, all air traffic is looking for these kinds of benefits. So there's a great deal of interest from the air traffic management world in what we're doing in the UAS traffic management. But also, as a primary job, we would like to enable UAS traffic. The European Commission and the European, Parliament have identified that operation of small UAS will provide economic stimulus. There will be jobs resulting from these kinds of activities. So they're keen for this to happen as an end in itself. But the benefit that we can accrue from that, we can also apply to air traffic in general.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>27:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Andrew, in that vision that you lay out for the transition to automated handling of, that air traffic, is there agreement on the roadmap for how that information would be communicated to the aircraft themselves and how we move from where we are today to have a different way of communicating that information that its own pipeline is much, much higher capacity than voice over VHF that we have today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, we're at the beginning of this. So, we have a vision of this today. We are not even close to implementation. So the roadmap to get there will start by, let's understand the problem and solve it for the small UAS. And that's going to take us several years. it'll be 2050 or later, before we're beginning to apply this stuff to all upper air traffic. So in, In beginning to attempt to answer these questions, yes, we are looking at what's called, Controller Pilot Data Link, CPDLC, which is being used today in Europe for what you might call low priority communication between the air traffic controller and the pilot. So effectively, they're sending text messages to each other. The use of this I anticipate will increase, and in order to increase, it will require that we have low latency communications. When CPDLC started, there was a lot of worry about the latency, the messages might take a long time. But as we get used to using them, then yes, this could be a way forward. This could be a way to allow further automation of the air traffic control system and then conveying the, information to the aircraft in a more speedy and timely manner.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are people also looking at what that workflow looks like for pilots and controllers where you might have mixed usage of voice over VHF and then the rollout of a data based link and how do people who are in flow, who are, working the traffic, how do they bridge across both of those modalities?

I've been involved in, simulation to do with researching this at least nearly 20 years ago, and the early use of CPDLC has been, well over 15 years. It is an ongoing activity and it's also used in the US and elsewhere. The crucial step is to trust it to be speedy enough to use for the kind of separation clearances. Today we're using it for the, lower speed stuff, the, uh, change the radio frequency and contact the other sector type instructions. But, for data link to be, the only means of communication, we need to get a bit more confidence about how well it works and how speedily it works.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, let's talk a little bit about Air Risk Mitigation. Let's bring it back to drone air traffic management. How is EASA approaching Air Risk Mitigation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, today the U space regulations describe a thing called a U space airspace. So the state will declare a U-Space airspace, and that's where these services will be provided and where there will be used. So this process of declaring a U-Space airspace, it's a kind of little reserved area which is dedicated towards flying, UAS BVLOS flights, and so the state has to, or the competent authority as it's called, it's often the Civil Aviation Authority or the National Safety Agency, but it's an agency which is interested in air traffic, will have to look at the region where they want to create this thing, and they will have to create what they call a concept of operation, what they expect the UAS to do, how they expect them to fly, the processes they want to follow, the expected performance, what is the, navigation performance they expect from the aircraft, what speeds are expected, what's the latency that they expect. So once they have this concept of operations and they have to make a kind of estimate of the traffic, they will then do this airspace, risk assessment in which they will balance all of these factors and they will come up with a, A description of how this USPACE airspace can be operated safely or meeting the target level of safety which has been put forward for the area. So that is in the bubble of the USPACE airspace. So EASA today is segregating the UAS into these little regions. For a flight outside these regions, EASA has described an open category of flight, which is visual line of sight, which is done, in a manner where basically the UAS has to get out of the way when something is coming. And the other option is certified operations, which at the moment, there's not really much said by EASA. That would be something that would need to be worked out between the aircraft operator and the Civil Aviation Authority, probably with some kind of specific agreement about how it would be done. Maybe with a danger area created or, temporarily segregated area created for the flight to occur. So these are the, three means of operating today. And this is how, air risk is being handled. In the U-Space regulation, you find two other aspects which relate to air risk. There's this idea of dynamic airspace reconfiguration, and in this process, if necessary, U Space airspace will be temporarily closed to allow a manned aircraft to pass. And this is considered to be done when the airspace was previously controlled airspace, and this process would allow it to revert to being controlled airspace. So, air traffic control could decide to close the used space to allow an aircraft to fly through safely. The third method, is this electronic conspicuity where a manned aircraft could enter the U space airspace so long as it was visible to U space. And this is, in my personal opinion, the least well described. I could imagine this working as an exceptional process, but I'm not so happy with it being a regular thing, because effectively the manned aircraft comes along and all of the U-Space traffic has to get out of the way, and in doing so may encounter their own problems. So, this is the current approach to air risk. It has to be said that the current European, regulations anticipate quite low density of traffic, and we would be looking forward to a revision of the regulations, as the density of traffic is rising, and we start to see a need for more subtle, air traffic management for the UAS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can we be a bit more specific and maybe run through a scenario of a drone operator who wants to fly a commercial drone delivery service or any commercial drone beyond visual line of sight in a, suburban slash rural area. And let's put the ground risk aside and just focus on the air risk. The challenge that exists today, and again, correct me if I'm wrong, but if one looks at the SORA air risk matrix, essentially any time that you're flying below 500 feet above ground, unless you are flying in uncontrolled airspace over rural areas, you pretty much immediately fall in, in the Air Risk Charlie class, which automatically classifies the operation as SAIL 4. The problem, though, is there's no tactical, TMPRs the tactical mitigations for the residual air risk that are approved for, medium and high integrity levels. So the challenge for these drone operators becomes; how can we somehow reduce the air risk class by either flying in U space, which is automatically class Bravo, or I shouldn't be using class Bravo because that confuses with traditional airspace, but ARC B, or they go and run an analysis of the actual air traffic, and show that the risk of encountering, manned traffic is actually lower than what the original SORA matrix would suggest, and therefore they get that class reduction. So talk about this challenge that operators today face. What are the levers that they usually pull on? Is this description correct?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Your description is perfect, and I'm very impressed with your knowledge of the domain. Yes, this is exactly what's going on. And if you look at, and I must say it's not something I'm particularly expert on, but if you look at the operations today, which are occurring, you have Manna operating in Ireland. You have Wing operating in Finland, you have soon Amazon operating Italy. They are typically having to deal with the fact that there's not yet uSpace available, but uSpace is coming soon. And as you correctly described, one of the things that they have to do is they have to make an argument about is the air risk acceptable? Is the risk of manned traffic coming by low enough? And typically that can be mitigated by asking for a restriction. and in Finland, you find, occasional restrictions are placed with the word Wing in the title, so you know who's operating there, but, either a restriction or, as you say, an analysis of the traffic, but that analysis, which you're talking about is the first small iteration towards this air risk assessment. Air risk assessment is a more thorough and long term version of this analysis. And so setting up a U-Space airspace is a logical extension of the process that, an exceptional operation would need to go through. So today, these operations are not in U-Space airspace, but the hope is that very soon they will be, we're expecting 2024 to see the first U-Space airspace is declared and it clearly makes sense to put them where people are currently wanting to fly. So, I would hope to see their emergence, in and around some of these areas where these operations are occurring.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:28\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the requirements for setting up U-Space? Is there a threshold in terms of the traffic density that an area needs to have in order to warrant U-Space implementation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, there's nothing like that. It's a a choice to be made by the competent authority in each state. So we may see, U-Space airspaces which are set up in result of a demand from an Aircraft operator. We may see them being set up as a result of a demand from a service provider. We have seen a lot of interest in flying in harbors, for example, and there the harbor operator might be the one who would be, pushing for, a U-Space airspace to, to be declared. Or we might see states who want to set up U-Space airspaces because they have an expectation that once one exists that flying will begin. It's hard to predict at the moment because we're in a special period at the moment. Everybody is feeling their way and learning how to do this. I think once we have one or two U-Space airspaces declared, I think we will, then gain more experience about how to create them, more experience about how they can be used, and we'll see a period of fine tuning, but also a period when more and more are created as the states master the process and are more confident about declaring these things. And it must be said that there is quite a lot of work to do in the airspace risk assessment, because at a certain point there needs to be a link made between, for example, separation and the performance of the various systems, the performance of the aircraft, the performance of the traffic management system, the performance of the surveillance as it is. So, this is why the states are going quite slowly at the moment, but I think once it's been done a few times, I think the states will gain confidence, and it will become something which is done more readily. And then I would see in Europe that it would be, not unreasonable that a request from an aircraft operator, certainly if it's going to be more than just a few flights, might result in the work being done to, to set up a U-Space airspace.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Talk more, Andrew, about why it's taken so long to implement U-Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's really been a learning process. The U-Space regulation was published, in 2021, and then it took us quite a long time to develop the acceptable means of compliance. And I would say this initial acceptable means of compliance will probably be amended as we learn more. But it still has a number of gaps. There's still quite a lot to learn about, what standards to apply, how to make the implementation, how to certify the service providers. What the, Airspace Risk Assessment comes out at. What is the minimum required performance for the aircraft in order to achieve a separation which is fine enough to make the U-Space airspace have a capacity that makes it worth operating? We can achieve safety by restricting the flights a great deal, but that's not the aim of U-Space U-Space should allow BVLOS flight to be approved relatively quickly and often that the expectation is that the aircraft operator will put in a plan and generally that plan will be approved. We are hoping to avoid that, that planning results in rejection and conflict detection as a, a frequent occurrence. It should be a rare occurrence. We're hoping to promote the use of the UAS by, creating these U-Space airspaces. So the, airspace risk assessment should hopefully, produce a separation requirement which allows a reasonable capacity. And the state, or the competent authority which is making the airspace risk assessment needs to be convinced that the performance of the aircraft, the navigation performance, its ability to fly, the surveillance system, the satellite navigation and so on. All produce a situation where this separation can be achieved and produce a convincing story that it can be achieved repeatedly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, where and when do you see U-Space being deployed in Europe in what countries and why?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have a reasonable expectation that we'll see something in 2024, probably Spain, Switzerland, and I'm hoping in Antwerp, there's a project called BIRDI, a European funded research project, which is trying to create, U-Space airspace over Antwerp harbour and I think they have a good chance. They, have a lot of resources and they're working hard towards this. But at the same time, there's a kind of unofficial race going on. I think Zurich are doing well and, I think we'll see one in Spain certainly in 2024, if at all possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Drone Detection, how are they handling it in the U-Space? What are the different ways they're addressing it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So drone detection has not been considered part of U-Space so far. And this is perhaps, it's worth noting that, security matters are the domain of the state. And, EASA, European Aviation Safety Authority, tends not to, get too much involved in saying things about what states should do. So, the U-Space regulation doesn't talk about drone detection, but we have a lot of interest in drone detection in Europe, and we're seeing quite a lot of activity, often driven by, state security organizations, often relating to airports, but other areas as well. And, the drone detection really is aiming at three different groups, referred to as the careless, the clueless and the criminal. And for the careless and the clueless, we can do quite a lot because we may require fit of equipment to the aircraft, which makes them detectable. The criminal are the third group and we're in an arms race with them. It's always going to be, what can we do and what can they avoid us doing? So, I think progress is being made in this field. Initially there was a lot of interest in primary radar, but that's very difficult. The aircraft presents a very small target for radar. The reflection is quite weak. The, small UAS move around at similar speeds to cars in some cases, or to birds. So it's easy to get, false positives from other things. So it's a difficult radar target, but there are methods that can be used. Other techniques which can be used include listening out for the command and control link radio signals. But again, in the case that somebody really doesn't want their drone to be observed, they can find ways around this. There has been some interesting work about drone detection in terms of one aircraft detecting another based on listening. There was a project called PercEvite, which was working on a hear and avoid, mechanism. And, that looked quite promising. And there's been a number of projects have been looking at see and avoid based on cameras and image recognition, sometimes stereoscopic, sometimes, with a single camera, these have in the kind of prototypes required quite a lot of electricity to be put into the, computing process to do the image recognition. But perhaps with a bit of refinement, these could become practical. It's not something that we're particularly concerned about in U-Space yet, because in U-Space we consider detect and avoid to be a safety net rather than the primary means of separation. So we are not at the moment requiring detect and avoid to be something fitted to aircraft in U-Space. Instead, we will separate the aircraft very widely so we feel that the residual risk is low enough that the detect and avoid is not necessitated. It will probably become something more significant when we go to higher risk operations, either because the density increases or because we start to have passenger carrying or things like that. So, there the risk might push us towards requiring, a safety net in terms of a collision avoidance system on the aircraft. And there, there is a lot of work being done. But at the moment, U-Space is not mandating any particular implementation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the U-Spaces that you expect to come online this year, the DAA function, as you say, will just be, assured in terms of making sure that the airplanes and drones never come close to each other or the drones themselves right. Is there a difference in how you are thinking about separating drones from manned aviation as opposed to drones versus drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the current functioning of U-Space, the drones are separated by means of the planning. So any drone flying in U-Space must have a plan. It's called a flight authorization request. And these flight authorization requests are de conflicted. So the idea is that we de conflict the plans. If the plans are followed, then we've de conflicted the flights. We can't do this with manned aircraft that wander in. So instead we have this requirement that the manned aircraft are electronically conspicuous. The electronic conspicuity is handled by the U-Space service provider, so it becomes part of the traffic information which is shown to the pilot of the drone. Now the traffic information which is shown to the pilot of the drone differentiates between nearby aircraft which are conforming to their plan, which are, the pilot would be aware of but not concerned by. And nearby aircraft which are not conforming to their plan, which are potentially a threat. These manned aircraft, which are electronically conspicuous, will definitely be in the threat category. So, the, requirement in U-Space is that the drone takes appropriate action, which will be to get out of the way. So that means that this, handling of the manned aircraft, it, it should be safe, but it is going to be an exceptional process. It is going to require that the drone deviates from its plan. I await experience to see how this works, how well we can accommodate manned aircraft, I would not be very comfortable if this was a frequent occurrence, but certainly as it's been described, it is intended to be an infrequent occurrence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in those cases where multiple drone operators are flying in the same area, how will drones be de conflicted and separated from each other?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's done by this planning. The drones will all need to plan. The plans will all be de conflicted. Even if they're using different U-Space service providers, the U-Space service providers between themselves will arrange that the plans are all de conflicted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So these service providers are commercial organizations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. So, the, approach which has been, encapsulated in the U-Space regulation is that the provision of services is a competitive commercial activity. So, we expect multiple service providers, or we hope for multiple service providers and that they will compete, they will innovate, they will offer added value to their customers. The U-Space regulation describes six services which they should provide, four of which are always required. The other two may be required depending on what the, Competent Authority says about the U-Space airspace and we expect that these commercial operators will offer their customers a service which fits the customer's need. If the aircraft operator has a need for, high precision, high efficiency, they're probably willing to pay for that, and they will be paying for tools which allow the kind of things they want to do. If the aircraft operator has lower requirements, they may be able to get by with a cheaper offering. So we expect these U-Space service providers to occupy niches, have particular specializations and to innovate in the area. So EASA, and the aim of the European Union was to create hopefully a single European market for U-Space service provision. So we would see the emergence of U-Space service providers who could operate in multiple European countries. We would get economies of scale and we would quite quickly arrive at innovation high performance and, hopefully the lowest possible price.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew, this four dimensional flight path de confliction strategic planning issue, there's been some research that showed that you really can't be very confident looking more than, several minutes, into the future because things happen in real life. There's weather, there's contingencies, there's all kinds of things. How well do you think that this approach will, handle the real world?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's a continuous trade off. The, plan that the aircraft operator is asked to submit is not a line, but a series of boxes. And we asked the aircraft operator to plan these boxes, as large as they need to be that the aircraft operator has a confidence of 95 percent that they can follow this plan. So, it's not clearly spelled out, but if an aircraft operator is consistently planning too small, they will deviate very often and they will often end up in a contingency situation and they will have to invoke a contingency plan because they're unable to follow the plan that they've submitted. The other option is that the aircraft operator is very conservative and, submits enormous boxes. They say, like, all of the city for all of the afternoon, and they will simply find that they're in conflict with everybody else. So, there should be a natural pressure that the aircraft operator begins to master their uncertainties, that they begin to understand what weather will bring, and they will plan in function of their ability to fly. We, would anticipate that they would hopefully get better at this. We would hope that they could vary their speed, for example, they wouldn't always fly as fast as possible. So they have a bit of margin to deal with unexpected gusts of winds and so on. So we would hope that, in a mature U-Space, the aircraft operators are able to plan in a manner, which is sufficiently sized so that they can conform to the plan, but sufficiently small that they don't simply conflict with everybody else.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is it likely that their uncertainty will increase the more minutes into the future that they're planning? You know, they might be able to be quite precise four minutes, five minutes, seven minutes into the future in terms of where the aircraft is going to be in the plan, but if it was a very long flight, would that change towards the end of the flight or is that something that people are mitigating?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We, that, that model is generally true, but there has been work in manned aviation with what's called, trajectory based operations, where we can essentially have the idea of a kind of four dimensional contract where the aircraft will speed up and slow down in order to be within the agreed performance. The question is really a trade off. How much is the aircraft operator prepared to sacrifice in terms of flying at the most efficient speed and the straightest line compared with flying in order to be able to get their plan approved. So we would imagine there'll be a bit of give and take there, a bit of trade off, and I would imagine that once a U-Space airspace is running, the aircraft operator would be, well, complaining, would be reporting to the competent authority if the planning constraints were holding back their business. There is likely to be a requirement that the, competent authority would revisit the airspace risk assessment. And one input into that is the expected traffic. And I would expect that the aircraft operators would probably take the opportunity to express their desire for a different compromise on separation should they find it too constraining.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do people discuss things like, you know, afternoon thunderstorms that come up that might throw the entire plan out the window in this type of an architecture?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They do, but certainly, bad weather is probably less of an issue in Europe than in the US.

Yeah, absolutely. Now, the trigger, surprisingly, might not be the density, because, eventually, when we can't master the uncertainties at the strategic phase, we have to try and master the uncertainties at the tactical phase. And then we would be required to do tactical conflict resolution. Once we have tactical conflict resolution, we can allow more residual risk to remain after the strategic. But one of the big drivers of uncertainty are passengers. So I could quite imagine that the introduction of passenger operations, these eVTOLs carrying passengers around, would quite quickly push towards the need for tactical services. The passenger typically is going to have an impact on the take off time predictability. If the person has to get into the vehicle, might be their first flight, might feel a bit unsure, might feel a bit frightened or unwell. I could quite, imagine that relating to a, it takes longer than expected to close the door and then they miss the takeoff time. So I could quite imagine that we would have to go to a process where the aircraft are not de conflicted strategically, but are subject to a demand capacity balancing process and then are being de conflicted tactically. And I would say that's going to be the big push, but once we have Tactical Deconfliction, we can use it to increase the capacity of U-Space airspaces as needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I mean, this entire conversation around strategic planning, just evokes the famous Mike Tyson quote that everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. So, and, so, why especially among aviation professionals that know that things happen in the real world. It never goes according to plan. It's weather, it's, all kinds of different things, right? And so, why is there so little emphasis on tactical means is it because the technology is not there?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So why is it all strategic? Well, because we currently don't have any confidence in the surveillance. In order to do tactical maneuvers, you need to know where the aircraft are. You need to know with a known level of uncertainty where the aircraft are. And we don't today know what that level of uncertainty is. You will notice in the U-Space regulation that conformance monitoring is optional today. That's because conformance monitoring also requires that we have confidence in and have characterized the level of the surveillance that we can locate the aircraft during flight. And we don't today have that level of confidence. So the initial use of U-Space will be almost completely based on this strategic de confliction, and because of that, the margins for all of these uncertainties will have to be very large, so the aircraft will be very far apart. Once we begin to see flights, and we begin to get some experience, we can begin to characterize how well does the surveillance work. And in the U-Space regulation, there's this thing called Network Remote Identification, where the aircraft is sending to the U-Space service provider its position and the time and its identity. We will observe that for quite a while before we begin to rely on that. There may be opportunities to confirm how well that system is working. Interestingly enough, one of the users of U-Space is Israel, and in Israel, for security reasons, they have been doing a lot of monitoring the position of these aircraft by other means, and have been able to determine reasonably well how well this network remote ID is working. And certainly they have now scaled their separation minima in function of their confidence in this network remote ID. In the rest of the U-Space community, we still lack that experience, and I would expect most competent authorities would want to see traffic in their own cities, in their own U-Space airspace, and understand how well the surveillance is working before they begin to rely on it. So this is why we will have essentially have to have a time delay before we can get to any kind of tactical service. The first tactical service would be conformance monitoring. Conformance monitoring would allow, these margins for uncertainty to be reduced. They would allow the separation to be reduced a bit. And then, once we're really confident we would be able to introduce tactical services where we're giving instructions to de conflict the aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is the rough timeline for this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I, optimistically, we'll see this stuff experimentally very short term but to have it rolled out generally, it could be another 10 years before everybody is really confident about this and it becomes routine, widespread.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned a little bit, different ways of, detecting. Acoustic, Optical, et cetera. Can you spend a bit more time, and perhaps broaden that list, including Radar and some of the others and comment the pros and cons, of each and what you believe is the most attractive option.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To detect a non cooperative target, the problem with radar is that you illuminate the target with your own radio. So the amount of power that needs to be pushed out in order to get an echo back is enormous. The power falls off in proportion to the fourth power of the distance. So, you can be transmitting thousands of Watts and get microWatts back. So it's a very difficult job to do. And as I said, there are similar targets which will give clutter. There are cars and birds and things like that. Typically, we're seeing radar reserved for situations where the high cost, can be justified despite the low range and the not fantastic performance of these systems, but still it's better than nothing. Much more interesting to use optical where the illumination comes from the sun and you only have to capture the reflection. There is work going on there. I haven't been so involved in using optical, processes to detect drones for example, surveillance, but in terms of, collision avoidance, there's been quite a lot of research done in universities about this. And I think we're potentially seeing, this leading to practical systems in the reasonably short term. Hear and avoid is in the very early days, but it potentially, has quite some benefit. It's very good at detecting light aircraft, for example, or helicopters, which are especially noisy. Then we get onto collaborative means. If the other aircraft would like to be detected, radio based systems are obviously one option. The problem there, though, is finding radio frequencies which are available. Proposals for the electronic conspicuity which are coming from EASA include, one of these industrial scientific and medical radio frequencies, which is all very well, but it may suffer from interference. Another option would be, acoustic or, optical broadcasting, so, some kind of flashing light or ultrasound or something like that. And I think work is going on all of these, but, Yeah, I haven't been involved particularly in any research project which is looking at that. My, my main interest so far has been traffic management rather than on vehicle systems. Our colleagues over, at, Johns Hopkins are looking at a, there is a, some work going on developing a replacement for TCAS. TCAS in the generic term is referred to in the industry as ACAS, and the project which was developing a replacement for that was ACASX. ACASX spawned some variants, one of which was ACAS XU, which was for unmanned. Quite some work has been done on that. And, Josh Silbermann at Johns Hopkins was leading a project called ACAS SXU for small unmanned. And that was pretty promising. I've not been involved in that for a year or more, but it looked like it was going to go somewhere. So that was looking at using a system which would be compatible with manned aircraft. So, I think if that comes to, fruition, it's quite likely that standard would be adopted quite widely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Has there been any research on the potential for detecting the RF energy that's being emitted by the drone's propulsion system, perhaps the speed controllers or other sources of, what most of us would refer to as EMI, but detecting that in a useful way.

Projects which I've been aware of have more focused on the command and control link, which, is easier to detect and also easier to interrupt. There have been some, different approaches with that, because certainly, you can buy this box from DJI, this aeroscope to listen in on their communications. It makes it more obvious about what to jam if you want to jam the thing, and also you can listen on the telemetry. You can find out where the aircraft is, where the aircraft operator is, and things like that from listening into the command and control. So it's very beneficial to do that. The problem is if somebody doesn't want to be seen, they will encrypt that or they will use other methods. If they're already criminal in the way that they operate the aircraft, they can be criminal in the way they use the radio spectrum. So it is a harder task to detect and stop somebody who doesn't want to be detected and stopped.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's talk a little bit more about the service organizations you've talked about, Andrew. What's the barrier to entry for some of these organizations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The barrier to entry is probably, not enormous, but it's certainly there are fewer companies pitching into the service provision area than we saw emerge trying to build aircraft. So maybe it's not such fun. But if you look at the ones who are active today, I would single out the team at Wing as having put a lot of energy into developing standards and trying to create an environment, for U-Space for UTM. But Wing are a bit unusual in that they have no particular desire to be a service provider. They are, they see service provision as being just a necessary step so that they can become an aircraft operator. Amazon have also been active in that area. Again, Amazon, I believe, will only be their own service provider, but they've certainly contributed to the standards which are being evolved, and they've taken, quite some role in, in driving the industry. So those two are combined aircraft operator service providers. In terms of who else is in the service provision? You have a few companies who are pure service providers. I would, mention Dronic in Germany and, D Flight in Italy. and each of those kind of emerged before the U-Space regulation was published. And at that time, there was a slight expectation that they would become the kind of the appointed national service provider. But they are purely service providers. Behind them, there are companies writing software for service providers, and there are more of those, and I would mention. ANRA is one, which is operating in Europe and the USA. Unifly is based in Belgium. They've done well, supplying software to different, operating companies. OneSky, another, American company, which is seen in Europe. Drone Radar in Poland. and some of these, although they are primarily aiming at being software suppliers, some of them are in the process of becoming certified as service providers to prove themselves and also to make up for the fact that other service providers are not stepping forward. I know that ANRA are in the process of being certified at the moment, and we might see them offering services possibly in Switzerland, I don't know, but, they may see that as a necessary step. There are some of the larger ATM companies involved in the business, like Collins, Frequentis, Indra, and Thales, and all of these are looking at parts of the business, Frequentis is probably more looking at the other end. In the European model, there is the U-Space service provider, which, delivers services to the UAS operator. And then there's another body called The Common Information Service Provider. And Frequentis are looking at supplying software to those. The Common Information Service Provider is, a role which the state may appoint one or may decide not to and that role is involved in distributing information to everybody. And so Frequentis are looking at that, Indra are looking at that. So there are different larger companies looking at joining this market. I've met most of these companies through participation in European research projects. So when we've been, looking at, doing research, I've particularly been involved in research projects, looking at really fundamental questions at low maturity. I've worked with many of these companies, in these research projects, trying to answer very basic questions. How should things work? How do we solve these simple questions. What does a flight plan look like? And how do we deal with it? And so on. So, that's where I've met them. I've, I could mention even more. There's, Airbus UTM, who were previously known as Altiscope. They have a simulator. I'm working with them, they have a reference implementation of UTM in their simulator. There's a strong team there, they're very active in the development of standards, they're very active in the, work that's being done at ICAO, looking out how we can, integrate, this UAS stuff into the ICAO annexes and documents. We also have other smaller companies, the Technological Institute of Galicia has developed some UTM system, which has been adopted by Boeing. Boeing have a team in Madrid who are really expert at simulation of aerodynamics. And so Boeing have developed a simulator for, UAS which uses the ITG system to offer a complete package. There's a company called Open Skies operating. It's a very small company, but they've developed an open source, implementation of a kind of uTM system, which although it doesn't, isn't fully functional or it's partly functional, it is very compliant with the available standards. And because of the standards, compliance, their tool, Flight Blender, is widely being used for testing, often in combination with the, automatic testing mechanism of the, inter USS, which is an implementation of the, Discovery and Synchronization Service. Inter USS is also open source and it's a reference implementation of the DSS and includes within it a testing function. People are using that to test their system and they're using FlightBlender as a reference to compare their system against.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The big outstanding question is how do these companies make money, right? What's the willingness to pay?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a question I simply can't answer. These are very tough times to be in this business, because there's not enough flying yet. We suffer a bootstrap problem in this domain that until there's traffic management, there won't be flying. Until there's flying, there won't be traffic management. So somebody has to get it started, and these companies are all hoping it starts soon. Because without flying, there won't be a revenue stream for many of them. I still wonder how many, the market has room for. I have good friends in all these companies. I wish them all very well, but honestly, it's a tough business. I don't envy their position.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew talk about the origin of U-Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So U-Space, we started with, an idea that there would be traffic management and in the research domain, we looked to the end goal from the beginning. And the end goal was that we would be able to control all traffic, including passenger carrying operations. The other thing that happened quite quickly in Europe was, the European Commission identified that UAS was going to be an area of important commercial activity. So, they wanted to promote U-Space. So, top down, Europe got to work on regulations. Regulations are valuable in Europe because we are 27 European Union member states. It would be quite likely that without a top down European regulation, we would have 27 completely different implementations. So the view of the European Union was that they would like to promote a single market. They wanted a harmonized environment where an operator, an aircraft operator or a U-Space service provider operating in one European country could move to a neighboring European country without difficulty. So this is why in Europe there was a rush to produce a U-Space regulation. This U-Space regulation has described how to fly beyond visual line of sight and it's described an airspace in which this is possible called a U-Space airspace. Now in America you have a totally different set of problems and you have a totally different environment. The Federal Aviation Authority is both the regulator and the service provider. And it was quite clear that Congress wasn't excited about the FAA becoming a service provider to drones. So I would say that the momentum in the USA was held back. It wasn't being driven by the FAA. Industry was driving this, wanted to do some stuff. The FAA was following on, making it possible, but observing, and we now see the gestation of this part 108. It will hopefully be available for comment this year. I think I slightly envy the position the FAA are in, in that they will be able to write Part 108, taking into account experience and observation of flying, which is, which has taken place, without their regulation. And so I think, the rest of us will look at the American regulation. I mean, Some people might say, Oh, it's behind, but. It won't be behind. I think we're all moving at the same speed. The American regulation will benefit from having been written, having taken into account the experience that's being gained, for example, at the moment in Fort Worth, with seven different operators flying, seven different service providers supporting them. And so the learnings from that experience can be fed back into regulation. Yes, there are big differences in the current situation, but I think in general, we're pretty similar in what's driving this, that the drones are there and we need to take care of them. They may pose a risk to the other aviation. They may pose a risk to the public. In general, the Aviation Safety Authority is tasked with dealing with that. So drone regulation is a natural outcome. And the second is that in, in both the US and in Europe, there is a political imperative to enable this stuff. So the regulation is not purely restrictive. It is trying to let this stuff occur. So I, I think, we are following slightly different paths, but we're going to the same place quite quickly. And, in my domain, in the research domain, we have a healthy cooperation with both NASA and the FAA. We meet, we compare notes, we discuss. So there is not any fundamental difference in outlook or opinion. But there are some. Some differences in just, like, the way things have ended up. Our regulation came first. Our regulation particularly pushed this idea that service provision would be a competitive market. It could be, that in some states they're not bothered about that. They might want to simply appoint a single service provider, as is often done for, manned aviation. So you know, that's a choice that Europe has made so it's not necessarily the only choice, but it's the one that, in which I'm working. And, it's a similar choice that has been made in the USA. FAA doesn't want to be the service provider, so there'll be a market for service provision.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:18:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What notable differences exist in the way that the FAA and EASA think about strategic and tactical deconfliction?

So the work that's been done in the USA, on the passenger carrying operations started with this question. Is it when, well, it started with the question, what is it? And then they might discover that it was similar to, managing small UAS. In Europe, we started with the question, can we extend the system, which is designed to manage small UAS? can we extend that system to manage passenger operations? So in America, you'll hear these terms like pSU, Provider of Services to, I don't know what the U is, UAM. and we have discovered from the work done at NASA that it's very similar. One of the key differences is in the world of the passenger carrying operations, the PSU will not do strategic conflict resolution. The PSU will make, with a demand capacity balance, they will limit the number of aircraft entering the airspace to the level that the tactical processes can safely deal with, and then the separation will be tactically achieved by, well, by means which are, still under discussion, actually, because, one of the interesting things about this work on, urban air mobility in the U. S. A. is this idea that there will be these community based rules, and these community based rules are still being worked out. We in Europe are being a bit more top down, we are saying it's going to be the similar approach which was, is being used for small UAS. So we're, at the moment, we're talking about strategic followed by tactical. It may be in future that we might drop the strategic. I don't know. It depends. That's the subject at the moment for research. But, the model that we're working on today would be a strategic with a certain residual risk and then tactical to deal with that residual risk.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Andrew, paint a picture of what the next five or so years looks like in relation to U-Space drone operations in Europe and potentially beyond.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Andrew:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:20:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think, I would really seriously hope that within five years we see, operations of a commercial nature in Europe. I would expect to see a revision of the acceptable means of compliance of the U-Space Regulation. I would expect to see the American Part 108 has been published and is in use. I hope, but I'm not expecting a revision of the U-Space Regulation itself. Regulations are hard things to change. I would like to see, commercial operations. I would expect that they would probably be focused on niche areas where there's an obvious business case. And one of the most interesting areas that we're seeing in Europe is harbours and port areas. A lot of processes in harbours and port areas require somebody to get into a boat, or if you were going to do an aerial observation, It's very expensive with a helicopter. So there are many things that people want to do that they cannot. And so I would imagine, as we're already seeing in Rotterdam, Antwerp, and in, Hamburg Harbor, we will see a growth of use of, drones and, implementation of, U-Space or U-Space like currently, but hopefully official U-Space in Harbor areas. This is, I believe, commercially viable today. The other area, which, is a pressing area of interest is delivery, but delivery today in Europe is tending towards suburban, so it's not really an urban activity. And I would imagine that, the kind of pilot projects that we see in Ireland, in Finland, in Norway, we're working with a company called Aviant, which is delivering around Trondheim in a rural area. We would see these increase in number and we would see them being enclosed inside U-Space airspaces. And we will see these U-Space airspaces popping up like, like mushrooms on a lawn. We will probably be a, not obvious why they're there, but then you go and look and you find there's, here in this place, there's a niche where commercial operations are viable. I would say that the, my least expectation is that it becomes focused on urban, in each case. I would say that probably suburban or harbor will be my initial one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:23:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew you've been doing this for a while.

If you, hear some of the stories which are being told about, what people want to do, I would say, is it really realistic to try and compete with ground transport? And you may recall, an experimental project that was done by Airbus, pre COVID, a thing called VOOM, where they set up a kind of on demand helicopter flight service in San Paolo. San Paolo has the benefit of having a large number of helipads, has a quite a large population of helicopters, many of which are sitting idle most of the day, and it also has terrible traffic problems. So there was a willingness among the public, or some members of the public, to pay quite a lot for a short flight and that made this VOOM thing viable. I would say if you're going to come into this business, you need to understand what is the specific set of circumstances where your business will work. And if you come in with a general approach, we're going to deliver cups of coffee. I would say, like really, how can that be better than the man on the bicycle or whatever the alternative is today, you really have to understand what is your value added and where is the niche where that value added is appreciated. And yeah, I wouldn't today be looking at trying to replace or compete with the metro or even taxis in many cities. I'm sorry if I disappoint my colleagues in the taxi business, but really you have to be pretty good to do better than public transport in most European cities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:24:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andrew this has been a great conversation.

There's an opportunity now to have a new, fresh approach to say, if I'm the customer, the traveler, I want to travel, what is the natural experience for me? And just build something like that for me, rather than here is the system we've built for travel agent 50 years ago, figure out a way to follow the right sequence, to find the right seat and the right destination and the right connection and all of that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:28\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey everyone. Welcome back to The Vertical Space for a conversation with Eric Leopold a long time veteran of IATA, the International Air Transport Association. We start the conversation, talking about the state of the airline industry and its current priorities such as the post COVID recovery, digital transformation and sustainability. As most of, you know, there are large regional differences in the maturity of the industry and therefore priorities, but we generalize the discussion on bottlenecks that airlines and airports face as the demand for air travel grows and potentially doubles over the next 15 to 20 years. Here we touched on capacity, ground infrastructure, workforce, the IT infrastructure and how advanced air mobility can solve some of these bottlenecks. We also discuss whether the hub and spoke network model continues to be prevalent in the future. Another key theme in the conversation is digital transformation. What are the opportunities on the business side and on the operational side. And how airline and airport CIOs are thinking about prioritizing their budgets across projects. Part of the discussion is the role of generative AI in the travel experience. For instance, Instead of going to an online travel agent to buy your ticket, Eric suggests we might be able to buy our flight in a supermarket or a bank or any other retail location for that matter. Or we might use generative AI and a voice interface to guide us through the travel booking process, one that is more personalized and more in tune with our individual preferences. If you're looking for an expert and pragmatic opinion of the challenges and opportunities that aviation is facing you're in the right place. As mentioned, Eric is a veteran of the airline industry. At IATA he held numerous roles in strategy, digital transformation and standard development over the span of 15 years. His last role was director industry strategy, focusing on the restart of the air travel industry after the COVID 19 pandemic. Prior to this role, Eric was the director transformation for financial distribution and data services. His team led the transformation agenda for the air travel industry, including change programs and industry standards, such as the new distribution capability(NDC). Eric championed the digital airline vision, enabling airlines to become digital retailers and efficient financial organizations. Eric is now the founder of Threedot a consulting firm, providing services to the travel and tourism industries. Threedot advisers, all companies, including airlines, airports, travel agencies, travel tech investors on their strategy for innovation, growth and transformation. Eric holds a master's of science in electrical engineering from central Supelec. A master of science in computer science from Georgia tech. And MBA from ESEC. And a diploma of the advanced management program in air transport from Nanyang university. Eric is married, has two daughters and lives in Geneva, Switzerland. I enjoyed the conversation with Eric after a brief sponsor message. Eric, welcome to The Vertical Space, it's a real pleasure to have you on the show.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you, good to be here.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is there anything that few in the airline industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's interesting. Lately, I would say, when we're talking your future of travel, some people, most people now are quite pessimistic saying that, sustainability, we have to reduce flights, etc. And I think that there's going to be a breakthrough, that will make air travel sustainable. It reminds me when, for cars, you need a Tesla that says, we can do electric vehicles or for COVID you had, you need a Moderna or another one that says, we can have a vaccine in one year and not 10. So you need a breakthrough. So I think we'll see a breakthrough in the coming years, but unless it happens, I understand most people are pessimistic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What breakthrough do you see happening and how is that different from what most people in the industry think?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, most people see, that, to make aviation sustainable, so that people can travel in the next generation, we've been using the last two generations, is that unless, you have, sustainable fuels, so two thirds of the fuel will be replaced by what's called SAF sustainable fuel. The rest may be hydrogen or electric for short haul. That to me does not take into account, this scenario doesn't take into account, like a major breakthrough, like conversion of, sun and solar energy into, fuel creation or something that is impossible today. And I think what people are missing is the same people who said solar impulse is impossible. Flying around the world, with a solar plane, everybody said it's impossible. And there was a few crazy people like, like the ones of Solar Impulse, Bertrand Piccard, who said, I think we can do it. And that was the breakthrough. So I think it will come.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is your breakthrough, Eric, is it going to enable more sustainable flying? So there are people who question, obviously electric, electric is not going to happen with anything close to wide body for 20, 30 years, and, many question hydrogen for a variety of reasons, and sustainable aviation fuel, although a good idea, it's going to take a long time to get what we need. Is your breakthrough going to enable sustainable flight, or is your breakthrough in that area that, if you agree with you on, enabling some other part of air travel transportation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But first, I'm not sure what the breakthrough will be, so I know there's many people doing lots of research in many different places, and I don't know which one, will come, but if I look at electric engines and what I studied, 30 years ago, and what I still see today mostly, I don't see major progress. But now with all the attention that you have around those electric engines, I would expect, much progress in the coming years, same thing on batteries and so that's one part. Also on creating new fuels, we had decades of, fuel production one way. And now that we put much more research on that I would expect breakthrough there. So I don't know which one will be, the first one to happen. I just think if you meet again, and we speak again in five or 10 years, we will say, Hey, look what happened. I've been like, post Tesla, post Moderna, it's, or even, the, all the Uber and the, Uber was crazy before it was invented. You would never you put your kids in the car with somebody you don't know, and now it's maybe the safest way to, drive around. So it takes 5 10 years to, shift those mindsets, or to have a breakthrough. So I don't know, what exactly what will be, but there must be something happening in the next 5 10 years that will change the way we look at sustainability in air travel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's interesting that you compare this to the vaccine production. Do you feel like the question of sustainable air travel has the same level of urgency in the population? I mean, clearly it doesn't. so the question is, humanity put their brains together when there was an existential threat, which in this case, is probably not at that magnitude.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, you're right. The, RNA and all the things existed before, but there was no, appetite politically to try to take any risk and fast track adoption. And of course, COVID accelerated that. So there's probably not the same sense of urgency. for, sustainability in air travel. That being said, there's, big diversity, and differences, around the world. There's regions of the world where sustainability is clearly not the priority. Everybody understands what is happening, climate change, global warming, etc. But it's a matter of priority. And I think it's in the regions of the world where sustainability is on top of the agenda. That's where you will see, most of the funding and research, et cetera, going into, that area. Because when they look at the benefits and costs of aviation, benefits are huge, but costs, environmental costs are huge as well. And unless we mitigate that, the cost will be higher than the benefits. And it's true in some parts of the there may be decisions to say, aviation is too costly. so we should, decrease it or stop it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm sure we'll come back to that in a moment, but before we do, let's, just frame the conversation with your assessment of the state of the market for airlines and airports, if you would.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The state, of course, the big topic, in our, I call that sector, if you want, of aviation, is the post COVID recovery, and, that's the big topic. Demand is back, back at, end of 2019 levels. So that's the big topic. what has changed, I think, there's some safety incidents that are happening and that are quite worrying for, I think, people who are watching this closely, but even for the general public. There's, I think, a growing and bigger focus on sustainability, as we just discussed. I think even before COVID, we were still, talking about greenwashing, lip service, due to that. I think now it's, we've moved into real, planned roadmaps, etc. Also the regulatory side, government side, funding, production of staff, etc. So that I see like a real topic now. What's common with other sectors I see is digitization, right? What happened in, during COVID, many people went online and, remote work and all of that. Everything has been digital. We see that also in the airlines and airports, and that's accelerating. There are still parts that are very archaic, but a lot of progress. And the last thing I would say top of my mind is what I just mentioned as well, geographical, differences. You see really, different gaps, for example, between developing countries where, you're building new airports or you're building new runways in the airport or new passenger terminals at the airport. So a lot of still building at infrastructure because, aviation infrastructure builds so much benefits to those, regions and markets. And that's the contrast with the more developed countries where the market is mature, infrastructure is there, it's efficient, reliable, etc. And there's no way you can build a new airport or terminal or a runway or anything else. And, and passenger volumes, you cannot grow anymore. And so you're more like thriving and, Yeah, it's a totally different approach. Last 80 years, I would say, post Second World War, was about, growth of the infrastructure. But it's true in some parts of the world, you've reached the maturity. And so you need to think about what's the next phase of, of aviation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, boy, a lot of good areas to break down and evaluate there. Talk a little bit about the digital innovations and what part of aviation, do you see it on the revenue side, on the ops side? You probably see it everywhere, but what were two or three areas of digital, optimization that, that have occurred or will occur, and how do you think it's going to affect, profitability, and how do you think it's going to affect the traveler?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All, of the above. that, that's what's, interesting is that it's cutting across. I would say, on commercial side, the way airlines are, selling the product or simply, making them available, until today, you still need to go to a travel agency or a dedicated shop to buy your flights and things because it's traditionally being sophisticated and complicated. You can imagine that in the near future, maybe you can buy your flights in a box in the supermarket or you can buy them in any other sites, banks, anybody can sell your flights because it's easier to sell, to connect, to package, all that. The other thing that is interesting, I see evolution around, Gen AI and those new interfaces, these Rabbits that, It's like a phone with no apps and you just, speak with your little Rabbit and you say you know, take me there and you don't even know, what app will be used. If it's a travel agent, if it's an airline, et cetera, it's an AI, an agent will do that for you and we'll get you where you need to be, et cetera. So you don't even need to think where do I find the flights? How do I buy it? That's right. It's, it will happen with those AI agents working for you. So that, that's, big changes and this can happen, fast in five, 10 years. you can say today, if you want to buy a flight, you go to an airline or a travel agent, and maybe in 5 10 years, this has, completely, maybe not disappeared, but completely, changed. That's on the commercial side, and many other, changes. On the operational side, I think one big topic is the access to data, data from, of course, your aircraft, your engines, your et cetera, and being able to process that and use also the same tools, around AI to, to make, forecast, anticipate maintenance, detect, potential issues, all of that, but also a topic I like as well is, modernization of the atmosphere, anticipating, of course, weather, turbulences, et cetera. So that's, that's fascinating. and yeah, many other topics. Yeah, I don't know how much time we have.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Got a lot of time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. it's fascinating, areas, digitization. We were just scratching the surface. We are beginning of it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Two things, one on the commercial side, the, AI, let's say I I want to fly from one place to another, and you're saying that could be automated. Who will win and who will lose, for example, how will the global distribution, companies, is it possible that they as middle people could be vulnerable if that kind of AI revolution may occur? It's a great value to the user, who wins and who loses there?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. that's certainly the right questions to ask. I think we cannot have, simple answers like, the middleman will lose cause we've seen, many cases, you have suppliers on one side, customers on the other side, and suddenly you've got an Amazon in the middle or Uber in the middle. Whoever will facilitate supply and demand, becomes a marketplace, et cetera. But still there's this idea that if you've got those smart agents, know, AI type things, that knows what you like, how you like to travel, so it knows about you, and know about all the travel suppliers, hotels, airlines, but also, rail, railways. The distribution system today, they are limited to the data that's been, filed and provided to them. And now you have AI that is, not limited by that. They could find an itinerary. Maybe you should tell them I'm not in a hurry. Maybe I have a stopover you in city. I found a nice hotel. You don't know. So I'm just curious to see how will develop and what will be the new experience. Once have some use cases, then you can see, and it could be business travel, be others. Because you see the pain when you travel for business. You see the pain, in booking the flights, in changing the flights, finding the hotel, all of that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, Eric, been looking at the rabbit too. The booking is pretty steep hill to climb you that it could are a You It's All those things, you know, I just feel like I'm sitting there in the airport, I'm fighting with my phone, trying to navigate through these ever changing, menus and app pages. And if the rabbit could step in and just do it for me, I'd get my head out of my phone. That would be a huge win and, that's it's like first base, right? It's an easier hurdle to get over and, get people accustomed to the AI and allow the technology to be exercised and matured. So, I'm with you in that. I think that there are hopefully going to be a lot of these little steps, a lot of these little points of friction that get taken out by it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You're saying, Peter, as opposed to using the rabbit for the actual booking, where you might want to actually see and put eyes on the different options or pictures of hotels and whatnot.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. the actual booking, I mean, that's such a multidimensional sort of decision that people make, and there's a lot of stuff that the rabbit wouldn't know. It wouldn't have, it wouldn't have that contextual awareness of everything that goes into selecting the flight. But there are these other things that are so painful, and so tedious with the phone, if the rabbit could just step in and do it, that would be awesome.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, what do you think about using a voice interface for the actual booking part of the travel planning?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. if I take one example here, SeatGuru, SeatGuru, it's nice. You just need either the app or know how to use it and again, input your flight details and look at different configuration. All of that is painful. Now, either you have a travel agent who knows all that stuff. Fine, good luck, some do, or I say, call it Rabbit, call it Siri, call it any of those AI. And if you train them well, so they will be like, I remember, speaking with the guys at Alexa, they said, I don't remember how they call it, like a skill, there will be a skill in Alexa that understands, travel experience. It's trained and it will go through SeatGuru, it will go through all of that, it will learn your preference, etc. And it will help when you're doing the booking, and maybe some people will say, I still want to do my booking, and see the seats, and see options, and see, fine. But maybe while you're doing that, if you have like voice over, you can also use additional assistants that will do all the, as you say, tedious things to improve it. This I don't see like major breakthrough, like you have a new energy or new, other things, but it will evolve, the behaviors and preference of the travelers. And, today everybody thinks it's normal to go on an OTA and put, three letter code origin, three letter code destination, all of that. Yeah, the way we've been doing for the last 40 years, and the reason we do that is because the airline system that were built for travel agents, 50 years ago, suddenly, 20 years ago, somebody puts this layer of booking engine on top, and consumers had to use the same interface that travel agents were using, but it's never been designed for that. So that's why I say there's an opportunity now to have a new, fresh approach to say, if I'm the customer, the traveler, I want to travel, what is the natural experience for me? And just build something like that for me, rather than here is the system we've built for travel agent 50 years ago, figure out a way to follow the right sequence, to find the right seat and the right destination and the right connection and all of that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I heard, Eric Schmidt speak a couple of years ago, and he was talking about, when I wake up in the morning. I can say, where I want to be able to go. It'll know the delays. It'll know the traffic it'll automate the entire process. So let me ask you this. Who is most likely to develop this, and then who's most likely to be harmed from it? You've already said you're not sure, but let's face it. There's a lot of organizations that make money from that friction. There's a lot of organizations that might make money as you step of the way. If we don't want to talk about who will be harmed, who's most likely to make that innovation do you think?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's the Apple and Google of the world, who've got the maps, they've got access to data, they've got all of that. I think that's it. The only reason you know, most people would give you that answer to come back to your first question. Maybe I have a different answer. I think those, Google and Apple, they focus for the right reasons on more generic approach, they give you a map, they give you something generic, but I've never seen them really focusing on travel, the travel experience, all of that, because It's a niche, if you want, and it's complex, and it's etc. I still see an opportunity for, a new brand, a bit like an Uber, Airbnb, if you want, that would come. And the opportunity you have, something I believe since I was working at IATA, it's a digital identity. When you travel, long distance, road, cross border, your identity is key if you want, because you need to identify yourself at the airport with the airline through immigration all the time. So that's the one thing you need with you. If you, if this, key, this identity that, could be, what is going to be what everybody has when they travel, and if you find, could be again an agent, AI agent, managing your identity, from there you can build on that. You say, now I know who's traveling, and I know your, how to contact you, and I know your trips. Then I can start anticipating disruptions. I can anticipate all of that by connecting to, all the parties. And I centralize. Remember App in the Air? that was that type of disruptive app. The App in the Air could have been that. and there's others, apps like that, that could be the breakthrough I'm talking about. Like suddenly all international travelers, they say, hey, that's the key to have a smooth travel experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, do you think that this is necessarily going to be a new entrant in the industry that brings this technology to market?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My guess, based on my experience, is that it's easier for new entrants to innovate and go across what they do. I see airlines, it's very difficult within an airline to rethink different You know, activities on an airline, whereas if you're, even if you're Apple, you say, you know, I make computers, but tomorrow you can make, you know, movies, or if you're Amazon, you can make whatever you want. You're not limiting yourself, in, in one sector, whereas airlines, apart from AirAsia, tend to say, I'm an airline, so I'm in the business of flying, Metal Tubes. And except AirAsia who says, yeah, I can deliver food as well, I can be a bank, so that's why I say I don't see airlines doing it. Digital companies, even the innovative ones, again, Apple, Google, they are, it's not because, Google want to do social media that they are good at it. So, you know, Again, they are at their limit. So, I think the best way is to, find a few innovative people put some capital behind and build something scalable. That's how I see, again, all the examples we know. I mentioned Tesla or SpaceX. You know, AirBnB and Uber. We have, in the last two decades, we have lots of good examples of you start from scratch, you build the thing that people need and want. And in one or two decades you bring it to maturity. So that's what I see coming. That's what I call the breakthrough. And we've seen a lot in the last, 10, 20 years enabled by technology. There will be a lot. And like all the eVTOLs, all those new electric aircraft vertical takeoff landing, maybe it's going to be, Airbus, Boeing or NASA, but again, they've got lots of other issues. So I guess we will see one of the new entrants. One of the new players, having a breakthrough and building the one that has, good batteries, good efficiency, low noise, good range, all of that. And you say, wow, that's good. whether they will acquired by somebody else that I don't know. There's not many who say I go from zero to 1 trillion all the way. But that is, I think, innovation usually tends to come from innovative companies that don't have all the bureaucracy and burdens of all the big companies.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, when we think about the growth of the industry, are there any drivers of this growth in the post COVID era that are new to the industry as opposed to what we have observed in the past? I mean, Traditionally, it's been the growth of the middle income class. It's been urbanization, and it has followed roughly GDP growth. Is there anything different, outside, let's park the decarbonization, new drivers that are impacting the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, the short answer is that the usual drivers, you mentioned GDP, the reasons why people travel, and why it's convenient to travel by air. Those fundamentals, don't change because of COVID. I would just maybe give one example where it's changing. Is, the relation of people to work and work has been, something you do in one place, more or less. And, with remote work, and we need to see where remote work goes. But with all technology that enables you to work, from anywhere. This may have a significant impact, and even on, most importantly on business travel. Because sometimes you don't need to travel for business as much, et cetera. But then there are some people, because they don't see each other as often, maybe they travel, for meetings differently. So again, maybe it's too early to say the shift in business travel. That would be something that's different post COVID, because the relationship to to work where you work remote work, has changed. But for the rest, I think, fundamentals have not dramatically changed to covid, I mean not, not impacting the growth. What is impacting the growth, as I said before, is that I think we've reached in some, markets, not completely, but at least the infrastructure that was growing. population is not growing anymore, why grow the capacity if GDP is not growing as fast as before? And the population is not growing, et cetera. And it's, aviation is moving people in goods. That's it so it's growing in the regions where you still have that GDP growth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. But arguably people in those other regions want to come and visit as well. So you end up perhaps having an infrastructure problem. That's a question actually that we wanted to also discuss. what do you see as the major bottlenecks to the growth of the industry?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, bottlenecks. what you need to run this industry, so you need aircraft. So if you have two aircraft manufacturer and one is not able to deliver, you've got a problem of aircraft. Infrastructure in general, as we said, how many people you can accommodate through the air, you have the routes, through the airport, you have enough runways and, passenger terminals and baggage systems and all that. Then you have all the workforce. During COVID there were, young people training for being pilots and then they said maybe there's no, no more airline by the time I finish my training. So they go to something else. So if you don't have enough pilots and all technicians and all of that, then you need, fuel, you need sustainable fuel in the future. And where is the, production of fuel? So that, that's a bottleneck if we don't produce, new fuel fast enough and to fund all this, you need capital. So if the industry is profitable, it's fine. If it's not profitable, who's going to fund it? And some governments, fund it because it's critical to tourism, because tourism is 30, 40, 50 percent of GDP. So they need to flight. Some others, they will say it's not cost effective and, it's not. So was the cost of capital and, and we don't invest. So that's, There's a lot of bottlenecks, lots of challenges.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>According to market forecasts, the industry might double over the next two decades. And so when we think about the infrastructure that is at some places already at capacity, when we think about accommodating double the traffic in the existing air traffic system and airspace, what needs to change to accommodate double the traffic that we have today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So yeah, double the traffic is more top down, right? So if you say I grow, 3% per year of, 15 years, or I should say 4% or 4%, you double in, I think 15 years and 3% is in, 20 years or something like that. That's top down, you assume that everything stays the same and you grow at, 3 4 percent a year for the next 15 years, it doubles. What I was showing in terms of challenges and obstacles is more bottom up. You say, GDP grows, that's fine, there's demand, but are you able to deliver, right? So that's where I see the challenges. And, in some parts of the world, where you have is still high GDP growth and a lot of people don't travel. I think it's quite consistent. I don't know, like even Saudi Arabia now to plan 2030, they got huge plans and they are creating new airlines and buying lots of aircraft and all of that, putting all the resources. It looks like they've got a plan to manage that. I'm, indeed, I'm more concerned in some parts of the world where aviation is more mature. There's no new terminal, no new runway, no new nothing. But still, there will be a growth in demand. But is it a big issue though? I think if you have already some airports that are saturated, And what will happen is, if, demand is higher than supply, then, fares will go up. And a bit what we see in post COVID, while the fares are up, is because demand is big after COVID. Most people want to travel again and supply is not there because, not all the aircraft and crew and everybody is back there. This I think that's how it will regulate. I don't see fares going down in some parts of the world.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>32:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Eric, some of these locations you're talking about where there's, demand is exceeding capacity, almost today, are some of the same areas where, the advanced air mobility companies want to be able to concentrate their services. And, there's a perception that, we're not going to get in the way of the, existing demand for commercial air traffic in these areas, but they are with today's air traffic system, and we heard Paul talk about where we're at capacity today with air traffic, and then you want to introduce, eVTOLs into these very busy corridors. So this will all have to play together, and there'll have to be some breakthrough on the air traffic control and air traffic management side, you would think, to be able to accommodate it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>32:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's definitely an area where you need to break through because, air traffic management, is built for, certain types of, aircrafts and pilots, etc. Once you have new aircraft where either remotely piloted and pilot is not in the aircraft or even autonomous aircrafts, there's no pilot. All that, you don't have an infrastructure that's ready. If have more companies going to space and crossing, the space where aircraft are flying, you need also to accommodate all that. So there's many changes. Are we ready today? No. is that a challenge for the next two decades? Yes. and I agree. Here where the market, is for all those, new electric aircraft, short haul, that's definitely where you have the most crowded place, more, more mature, what time is of the essence. And what's interesting is that the, aircraft that are electric, the eVTOL, there are some hybrid, but the electric one, they have a proposition as well in terms of sustainability that's much better and acceptable by the public in those regions. So that's an evolution, but the number of challenges is still big.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It'd be interesting, some of our guests have argued, Eric, for some of the value of advanced air mobility is that the regional airports around these big hubs could act as ways of distributing that traffic. to the regional airport, and even though today it's a less convenient airport than what the major hub would be, with advanced air mobility, because of its speed and because of its ease, let's put cost aside for a second it's possible that you could spread load some of the demand of these big airports to the regional airports. What are your thoughts on that, as part of the value of AAM? I,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would say I have different thoughts, all right? I, at least, is my wishful thinking is that I see the opportunity to, bypass or get rid of the airport and get rid of baggage sortation system, get rid of all that complexity. I'm assuming that those, new type of aircraft will be smaller, more agile if you want, they don't need a runway. So to me, the concept of airport was because you need a runway. So I'm curious to see, those vertiports and other types of places where people can catch, those, new aircraft, but to me, success is that you don't need airports for that, right? and the only reason you go to an airport is because you need to catch, long haul flights. The one that will still use the SAF and will, take you for 12 hours in the air. But all the other ones that are, one or two hours, these, I don't see them going to airports. And baggage, also because it's smaller, so we need to find ways to baggage. And baggage, I see it, I don't think, we need to keep baggage to, traveling with passengers, that's a headache, coming from, regulatory, regulatory times, but I think with, we talk about passengers, but I like to talk about, goods and cargo and baggage. I think the, the new aircraft will carry the, the baggage and carry passengers. They will carry, bags separately. So wherever you go, you drop your bag. like a robot, a humanoid, something like that will pick up your bag, load it into a drone that will, carry the bag, and the bag will not follow you necessarily. The bag knows where you're going, and the bag will meet you at your hotel, your destination, wherever, and you don't need to travel with your bag. And it's not been the case because for security reasons, but I think we can have advanced screening systems that will solve that. So that's more where I see the future. We have, if we just replicate airport baggage systems, all of that, I think we missed an opportunity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, the technology community a lot who are working on these technologies think about the hurdles to adoption primarily as other technology hurdles this is how design new AAM vehicles routes for their early deployment or strategies for early decarbonization and changes to operation and infrastructure that would, take place commensurate with that. But in reality and from your perspective, you see the other non technological hurdles, the, organizational hurdles, the groups whose jobs are, going to face a lot of change that they're resistant to, etc. we've discussed a number of these in, this talk so far. When you look at it from that perspective, what do you see in terms of those other types of hurdles and what areas are going to, surprise us and encounter a lot more resistance from your perspective than perhaps, others assume.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, there's a lot. Yeah, technology to me is always, just, one element, but when technology comes with a breakthrough, that can change the whole game. I think we talked about demand. Is there demand in many markets to have different type of travel experience? In terms of speed, experience, comfort, also cost, etc. So this, I would tend to say yes, and I would guess most people would say same thing. Talking about hurdles, I can see how regulation is going to be a hurdle. Now, I don't see that as a negative, so what I mean is that the day we manage to have the regulation in place, it's going to accelerate. I remember, before GDPR, there was no regulation on data and you could do anything, but it, I think, was not good. And once you play rules, then everybody can play, and it can accelerate the spread. And I see if we can have global and harmonized regulation for AAMs and all of that. That, to me, would be a big accelerator. Most people see, a regulation as painful. I see it sometimes in something as standard. it can accelerate global development, global rollout. I see a lot of innovation and where I see a challenge, it's, bridging innovation. So many, innovation in airframes, engines, batteries, everything, but bridging them with the operators. And by the way, who are going to be the operators of the AAMs? is it going to be airlines? Is it going to be the aircraft manufacturers themselves? Remember when Tesla, created Tesla, and they say, the robo taxi, we are going to operate the taxis, because they can automate themselves and drive themselves, so if if you're a manufacturer of drones, are you going to become the operator of the drones, or will there be other operators? As long as that is not, clear. if you have new technology, who do you sell it to?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>the type And, I think it's clear that most well capitalized of those companies have generally been ones who are talking about model where they operate the vehicles that they manufacture. adds complexity, it does allow them to, capture a second node value chain and they would argue, create a lot more value along with you end up with the, the technology being brought into the market in a very prescriptive way. I have just, for a long time thought that we're going to learn a lot from customers and operators in terms of how they are going to use these aircraft and, in what scenarios and what new opportunities it will create for them. Things that they can see from their vantage point that, those of us, even in the aerospace industry, are just too far away from it to see it. And so I'm really interested in the companies that are bringing forward something that is a little more multi purpose, placing it in the hands of customers and then, seeing what happens and improving the product and building version 2 on the back of those insights. But, something I'm interested in your thoughts on are what might be, from your vantage point, the use cases for these aircraft, even in the early days when manufacturing volumes are necessarily going to be, pretty moderate, tens or maybe hundreds of units produced per year, but certainly not high scale for, high scale mobility networks or for deploying across many, urban areas in the world in the early days. And so is there a use case that you see from your vantage point that is inherently compatible with that? And that, in fact would deliver insights and also help build the maturity and the conviction around it to, fuel the scaling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What makes sense to me in terms of use case, I would say, use case for passenger and use case for goods. For passenger is, where time is of the essence and where connectivity as well matters what makes sense is like feeding airport. So if you have long haul, connections and, how do you increase your catchment area and you control, who's going to be there on time because the traffic in the air is, quite more predictable. That I see, a good use case, and that's what to me justifies why some of the, current airlines, see that as an extension of their business, but it's just, one. And that is an example that does not address, what we were saying is that if you're a manufacturer of, of the AAM, or the new aircraft, and you want to operate them, themselves. And if you have some operators who say, but I'm only interested in, I want to operate them. so what happens? All right. So that's why I see room for manufacturers and I see room for operators and maybe some would combine, but some won't. So I see both happening. And on the cargo side it's even more interesting, I think, because you have cargo operators, you have manufacturers, and both may operate, the, the cargo drones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's interesting what you observe about the catchment area, because for a major hub that's a high density place and it's going to be difficult to integrate a significant amount of AAM traffic into that airport, even if that traffic is from further away, regional air mobility providing connectivity into the airport I do see the opportunity for an aircraft that could deliver value because it can fly a longer distance than people comfortably want to drive to get to the airport, but not so far that someone going to take an existing connecting flight today then there's an opportunity, but integrating into a busy hub is going to be hard. So maybe it's medium sized airports or airports that are aspiring to take on a hub role in the network as it grows, but they're not there yet. And, they want to serve a larger distance around them in that area, or there might be bodies of water or other geographic hurdles that make it harder to access that airport from a wide range of areas via car. Maybe that's the early sweet spot for where to sort of build the repetitions and the experience with these operations rather than doing it in, you know, like New York or other giant cities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:43\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I'm curious as well. I see it happening in New York. I mean, You know, because it's congested and traffic is an issue and you want something, you know, predictable, reliable to go to the airport. so that, that's one thing. And also it depends if you can have an experience, smooth experience. So, where you land at the airport is convenient. are you already airside when you land? that type of things could be, you know, small things, but that. Make a difference if security is a pain point. So you can imagine you clear security, and even immigration. I don't know, when you board the smaller aircraft. So this to me, yeah, it needs to be looked at. That's for the large hubs, New York and others and also smaller, like, Nice in France, near Monaco, meaning that you commute, by car, it takes, an hour or two, and, flying takes five minutes. So that already exists with helicopters today. Where I live is in Geneva, Switzerland it takes, two or three hours to go in the mountains it will take, 15, 20 minutes. Which is, changing the patterns. You don't go there for the weekend because it's, it doesn't make sense, but maybe tomorrow you will do. I think there's different use cases per, I'd say, geographical situation and size and etc. And I know there's many people who've done all those analyses. Maybe I don't see, consistency. back to what should I have to do? But this, you know, ways the association, that comes with, harmonized, data sets around, what, how AAMs will, operate that. I think that's still up for discussion and the sooner we have some clarity and alignment between stakeholders on that, grow. myself in the shoes of an investor, america too much uncertainty. So you that where to your money, with i, I think one of the challenges that is reduce uncertainty. We need to regulate makes sense on safety, security. We need to harmonize standards, all discussions, more we clarify, the more we use you better it will be investors and the faster it will take off.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you look over the longer time horizon, and looking at the air transportation network whether in Europe or North America do you see we are, locked in with the existing number of hub airports or should we expect small airports are going grow their traffic and become additional hubs and will this hub system persist? Or do you think it, it will have more of a point to point element in its structure, especially as regional air mobility, is added to the network in addition, just assuming that. What do you think?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's the hub and spoke and point to point so that's one topic that's a lot of discussion around that. I still see the hub and spoke connecting short haul, regional and that type of aircraft to long haul for people and goods that need to travel long distance because it's still different types of aircraft and now fuel etc. So this I still see. In the market that I would say already mature, it's not the same airports that will be developed. I think it's a new, type of mobility that, that will be developed. That's where I don't think we should call them airports. We need to find a different word because there's no runway, there's no baggage system, there's no, so it's a different animal there. Whereas in some part of the world, we're still developing countries, where they still need to grow the infrastructure they are building and they will continue to build for the next 10, 20 years, more airports, passenger terminals, runways, etc. The way we know them today. until they reach something in infrastructure that covers their travel needs. Now, if I compare, railway infrastructure, the time it takes, the cost, again, in some parts of the world, you've got mature railway infrastructure, high speed rail, etc. Fine, it's mature, it's there. In the rest of the world, it's still faster to create a new, route connection, point to point, by air then to build a high speed rail. Now, China has demonstrated they can do it fast but not every country has the same resources. This will be interesting to go, market by market. I'm doing some work in India right now. I see air growing faster than railway for sure, and new markets, like Saudi Arabia and others. It would be interesting to see if there's a coordinated plan to grow, roads, rail, and air in a coordinated way under transport, or is it going to be, you know, chaotic at different speeds? So all of that, and I don't have the answers, but that's all the topics that I'm interested in and I'm watching.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's, talk about digital transformation, Eric, how do you see the state of digital transformation of the airline industry? How far is the industry in this process? What's proving to be easy? What's more difficult?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That reminds me of a project, it was just before COVID, it was, digital maturity of the airline industry. Because in one of the meetings, and we, we said, but how mature is the industry? And how do I know if my airline or my airport is more digitally mature? And what's the end game? how do I know that I'm a hundred percent digital and stuff? What's a digital airline? And so all those questions. We had no answer. So I said, we're doing to my knowledge. It still doesn't exist. so I don't have the answer but I remember when doing the exercise, yeah, you clearly have a industry agenda in terms of digital transformation. What are the top 10 things to do if you're an airline and if you are a CIO, where do you put your money in the next, five, 10 years? So yeah, this exists, in my previous life I was running the digital group, in IATA. So it was, 15 CIOs of airlines. And that's exactly the topic, we discussed is, what are the priorities that are, valid for, airlines in terms of digital transformation? But the name of the group was the Digital Transformation Council, so that was, that was it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what are you hearing from the CIOs at airlines and airports? How do they view the priorities in terms of allocating capital?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I still, do that, now, interviewing them and, looking at it So, you still see differences between regions, between size of airlines, et cetera. So of course that varies, but overall, you can categorize different ways, but I would say there's, something we touch upon, so there's everything on the commercial and, customer side, how do you make the experience better? How do you sell more? How do you grow revenue? So that's, there's a lot around and we talked a bit about, retailing and talked about identity. We didn't speak, for example, about, Virtual Interline, but how do you connect all the different modes of transport? And that would be true as well if you have different type of operators that are created. So that's interesting. And data, we talked a little bit, but all data analytics, AI, all of that. So that's interesting. So that's all on the commercial, customer side.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sorry to interrupt you, Eric, but do you mind going just a few levels deeper and maybe give some more concrete examples?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure! Yeah, so first, first topic, was the retailing part it was, how do I sell, more and better? What we mean by that is You know, airlines have more or less fixed assets, so you have this number of aircraft and seats, this number of rotations, so how much revenue can you generate per seat, more or less, right? That has not been a question for a long time, it was regulated. But in the last, 20, 30 years, and with the low cost carriers, et cetera, it's been a race to say how much you can generate. And that's the growth of ancillaries, the unbundling of the products and all of that. And I think we are just scratching the surface. It's the beginning. other industries that are much better at selling, cross selling and all that. And many industries are better also, understanding customer preference or building subscription and many other things. So it's just the beginning of that. So that's, I would say, high level on the retailing side generating more money per seat, per customer. The next one was, digital identity. So I touched on that. What's interesting is the, on the, ICAO side, so on the United Nations, on the passports, is the, the future passport we were, we had the basic paper passport, then we have the biometric ones, and now we are moving to, the virtual ones, but really the ones that you can put on your phone. Alright, so you don't need any physical documents at all. So that will be interesting in the way to dematerialize the identity and how you can connect that with other forms of ID yeah, so that connect to loyalty, connects to payment, connects to many other things in the airline. So that's, one big topic. Next one yeah, we said interlining, virtual interline. So, airlines are quite good and they've been good the last, I dunno, 50 years connecting, traditional airlines together. So you can buy one ticket from one travel agent on multiple airlines and you pay once for one ticket, one currency, and to travel on different airlines from different countries. And your bag is going from airport to airport, and all that. So that's what's called interline. So it's the equivalent of roaming in telecom, or bank transfers in banking, etc. How to extend that beyond the traditional airlines to any other mode of transport? So that's interesting area and the last one was, on data. Yeah, data analytics. So that's, understanding, customer behavior and then there's a lot of things there. But also understanding, all the flight data. what's amazing is the tracking real time of aircraft. How you see those pictures of, 20, 000 aircraft in the same time. And how you have more and more, data, about flights, about passenger preference about, and all the analytics and what you do to create better offers, that are more relevant. Some people say, oh, you're trying to increase the fares. What's increasing the price and the fares is supply and demand. But it's more, if you understand better what they need, you're going to make the right offer. If you know somebody wants to save time, you're going to sell something that saves time. Or if they want to carry luggage, you sell that. So how do you understand the travel patterns and the customer needs?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ryan on our podcast thought that was one of the big opportunities for innovators, is the use of the data to better serve the customer and lower costs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I fully agree.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, the ones that you mentioned, what strikes me is that most of them, especially on the data side, benefit from data coming off of existing infrastructure and systems, whether this is aircraft, different parts of the airline, operations, airports, et cetera, but I haven't heard many examples of data coming into this system and integrating new technology into what most would say are fairly fragile and antiquated IT systems at airports and airlines. What opportunities do you see there, or, is this such a lot more significant challenge of modernizing these systems that the CIOs are not really prioritizing that kind of innovation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That takes me to maybe the second type of priorities. I call that really IT infrastructure type, right? And that's how you bring, AI into your, all your software. So everything has been rule based, everything has been, process based, et cetera. And also, access of data is, most airlines don't have a lot of access to their own data for various reasons. How do you want to train your AI or do anything like that if you don't have access to it lots of questions around AI. And, I would say, also in terms of, very old software, there are still airlines out there that have systems running from, the 60s, 70s, which at the same time it says how amazing it was because, people built software systems, 50 years ago to run this global industry and it still runs perfectly today. So that, that's quite impressive at the same time, it's scary because you don't have any programmers who understand the code anymore. And I know some, they try to, redevelop it, rebuild it from scratch. They cannot. So that's scary. All right. a good exercise is, when you do your cloud migration and you need to make sure that you have, systems running in the cloud. I would say that's a big, I would say big programs, all those cloud migration. Now if I look at more futuristic topics, so this was more like, infrastructure one, but there, there's still on the IT side is, what will come with like quantum computing what is the next breakthrough? Say if you have, better, faster, algorithms and, computing power. What else can you do? So that, that's also quite interesting. And I would put next to that a topic that, most people don't talk about anymore, which is, Web3, blockchain, and all that. I'm quite convinced it will come back, after all the hype, is gone because what I like there, on the blockchain side, is everything around contract automation, right? And in the aviation industry, there's lots of contracts that is not automated. The ticket itself, when you buy a ticket from an airline, it's a contract, right? And there's conditions attached to it, and if it's all delivered, you pay for it, and if there's a problem, you get refunded. All of that is mostly manual today. It's not manual, I would say. It's not fully automated, right? the dream here is to say, every contract, it could be maintenance contracts, a contract could be, ground handling, could be ticketing, could be all of that. You put everything, every contract, and you automate it, so it's a smart contract. And if there's if it's completed, there's a way to know it's been completed, if it's successful, and there's a payment and settlement, also automated with it. And that will be, again, a major breakthrough once there's a system that can do all of that in many sense, it's still very archaic, the way the whole thing works. It's amazing to think that, many people 50 years, 60 years ago designed and built all that technology that will last so long but it also means that there's a major opportunity to have, massive breaks through there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Given some of the recent disruptions in airline operations due to software. What's the level of urgency when you talk to CIOs and broadly executives around finally modernizing the IT infrastructure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's interesting there is the level of support the CIO gets from the, CEO and the board, right because the day the whole thing collapses. It's not only the CIO who's a problem. And you see that occasionally. It's true for airlines. It's true for airports. It's true for navigation service providers. If you have the ANSP in the UK and they have a problem you're grounding all the flights in the UK until they have reboots, right? So I think, and something, airport baggage system can be completely blocked and nobody gets a bag and, check in can fail and nobody can board the aircraft and same thing with airlines. So I think we've reached a point where the CIOs are doing their best, to prioritize, to find solutions, et cetera. But unless there's somebody, at least the CEO and the board says, we cannot take more risk that we have a major failure that would ground the entire airline for we don't know how long, we need to make this major transformation, digital transformation program that would put us in a safe ground. Once you said that, you say, I wish I could start an airline today. And the question is, if you start an airline today, what system do you take? Right? So you've got two options. Either you take the systems that are proven, that were built, 50 years ago, and you say, wow, I'm going to do that. And the day I finished implementing, I already start thinking how I phased out. Or do you go with the new generation of systems? But it's unproven at scale, I would say. It's proven in the sense that it works, but it's not been proven at scale for decades like the rest. So that's, I think, fascinating times. And I see CIOs in a difficult situation, not only to find solutions, but to find the support they need to do what they need to do.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you see consensus on those two paths?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see consensus in acknowledging the issue. The issue is different from one airline to the other some airlines, they had their own IT, some airlines outsourced to one player, etc. So the situation is different from each airline. That way, there's most diversity is in terms of skills and visions of the CIO, support from the CEO, and knowledge at the board level. So that's why I would say almost every airline is in a different situation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that while you were at IATA, you managed a project to replace the boarding passes with magnetic stripes printed on paper to an electronic boarding pass.

What are some of the biggest insights from this project and something that you would advise entrepreneurs, as they think about innovating in airlines and airports.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's, that was an example where somebody had the vision, it was not me arriving and I was told, this is what you do, but somebody had the vision to say, what if we could dematerialize the boarding pass and then we said, when we, it's the airlines and the, when they had that, say, yeah, we think it would be something we can do in five years. And it was a major opportunity for a lot of, of course, airlines and airport benefited and travelers also benefited. Each time you have a barcode on your phone, that is your boarding pass and that, comes from there but also lots of, data, the one developing the software, the one developing the scanners, etc. once you have an entire industry that agrees on a new way of doing business or operating, it means that you are going to have hundreds and hundreds of customers around the world that need to comply with it. And it's compliance in the good sense, meaning that it's the, this project of the mobile boarding pass, we estimated we would be saving 1.5 billion dollars every year to airlines and airports, right? So you had the a good reason to do that. There was a very strong business case for that. So yeah, that's the advice. Keep an eye on any shifts in, standards and technology that is happening because it means that everybody in the market will need to change their equipment or their software in the next five years. So thanks for giving me the opportunity to look at the big picture. Sometimes it's scary because you look at all the challenges that aviation is facing and you say, Oh my God, it's, it's going to be difficult and also take the opportunity to dive into some of them. And think positive, what we said about think differently and remember that there's been breakthrough and there will be more coming. And also see, standards and regulations sometimes as the catalyst and the enabler for a lot of innovation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's the one point that you would, want the audience to take away from our discussion today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would say one thing that's for sure is a change is coming in this industry of what we discussed. And when change is coming, you've got like two sides of it, so I've chosen the, call it positive way to see the change. You say change is going to improve things. And be part of that change, innovate, build new things, support the implementation and all that. I, that's why I encourage people, I say, take the opportunity to be, the drivers of the change. It's such, it's also much more comfortable than being the recipient and, and that's it. And I would say I see travel as a force for good that's coming from, you know, 1944, heads of state said, we need to build, international travel, and they recognized that. And now there's a challenge, is sustainability yeah, we need to address this challenge and make sure that travel is a force for good and is sustainable. So we don't have to choose travel and sustainability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Great.
