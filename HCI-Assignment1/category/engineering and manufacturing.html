They were \"the guy\". But later, this system integration really enabled them to produce systems that are simply much more performant. If you are not just doing your own manufacturing, but also rather than system integrating components that are produced by other parties, you are actually building all those technology blocks yourself from the chip out and then from within the chip itself, you can start to unlock all these little pockets of efficiency that sit between the black boxes that you would otherwise connect being a system integrator. And it boils down to, in order for these subsystems to be compatible they need to talk over certain protocols, which are designed for interoperability, not necessarily for efficiency, and they're always a compromise. When you have the luxury of owning the black boxes, the two black boxes you need to integrate, then you can open them and you can tweak them and you can optimize for whatever you're optimizing for. And then unlock a tiny bit of efficiency here, tiny bit of efficiency there. And when you look across the whole system, these little efficiencies compound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>2:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">For those in the small UAS space, Orqa is a fairly well known name. Despite maintaining a low public profile, this innovative team from Croatia has been making significant waves in the industry. Starting with ultra low latency, First Person View goggles for the niche drone racing market, Orqa has expanded to build essentially every drone component, including their own drones, through a fully vertically integrated business model. This approach optimizes both cost and performance and is positioning Orqa is a strong Western alternative to DJI. Welcome to another episode of The Vertical Space, where we have the pleasure of speaking with Orqa's CEO and co founder, Srdjan Kovacevic, about the past, present, and future of small UAS in both civilian and defense applications. Srdjan begins by expressing his disagreement with the belief that hardware in the small drone industry will become commoditized. He underscores the crucial role of hardware in achieving peak performance for small aerial robots. And he traces this misconception back to the early days of the consumer drone industry and highlights how DJI's relentless innovation enabled it to dominate the market. The conversation addresses the challenges and opportunities of vertical integration as opposed to system integration, drawing parallels with the mobile phone industry. We delve into specific examples demonstrating the significance of vertical integration in small drones, particularly in the case of ultra low latency video data links. The discussion also explores how market dynamics and geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine are shaping the drone industry. And Srdjan also talks about the intricacies of FPV systems, their application in modern warfare and the potential future developments in drone technology. As mentioned, Srdjan is the CEO and one of the co-founders of Orqa, the world's leading FPV company. Orqa is dedicated to advancing the state of the art in unmanned technologies and remote vision. Before founding Orqa, Srdjan had a distinguished career in the financial industry with over a decade of experience in asset management. He served as the chairman of the management board of Croatia's 150 million Euro sovereign equity fund and was the Head of Risk Management and Compliance at Croatia's largest asset management company. Srdjan earned academic degrees from University of Oxford with a Master's of Science in Mathematical Finance and University of Zagreb with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering He is a certified pension fund manager and certified investment advisor. Enjoy the conversation with Srdjan after a quick sponsor message.

Especially for unmanned, I strongly disagree with that. I don't think hardware is going to be commoditized. I don't think you can ignore hardware. Or, ignore hardware at your peril if you're doing small things that fly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Expand more, please.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Give us some more details. And then how long do you think this will persist?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think this is going to persist until, critical mass of people are proven otherwise. And, if you ask me that fallacy goes back to, 2014 15 so speaking specifically in a small UAS space, in the drone space, right. And I believe you could trace it back to, point where DJI, really, defeated, 3D robotics, and 3D Robotics decided to pivot in software And, despite the, overwhelming proof otherwise, we keep hearing that mantra that, oh, hardware is going to be commodity, so we should focus on software solutions in the drone space, where, it's glaringly obvious that, the way DJI won was by relentlessly focusing on improving hardware from a generation to a generation of the product and, again, I'll say it, neglect hardware at your own peril when it comes to small things that fly. Software a part of the solution, we shouldn't be neglecting software, but I don't think you can achieve the level of performance if you think you can ignore hardware, or run your software somebody else's presumably commoditized hardware.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Why do we hear hardware can be a commodity? And is there any particular part of the hardware that you think is potentially becoming commoditized?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">so I, I think that goes back to the experience that we had with, a PC world or computer world, like hardware is arguably commoditized there, but, then again, it only takes a look at, what Apple is doing to realize that, yeah, hardware can be commoditized, but if you want peak performance, then you need to vertically integrate and you inevitably end up doing your own silicon, which I believe is going to be the case with the small unmanned and by the way, which is what DJI is doing at the moment. In saying that, people are, willfully or unwillingly ignoring, cherry picking the examples that fit to preconceptions. And I think it's just like, one of those things that are so easy to say, so we don't think about when we say them. But I hate hearing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you think that, this argument is true for component level hardware, or are you referring to the art of integrating a hardware product together with all of the, details associated with it, which we will get into more detail later.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's an interesting observation that you ask it like that, and I think, by saying that hardware is going to be commoditized, we gave up on, the possibility that we can compete with DJI, like a collective, rest of the industry and we're settling for a world of commoditized hardware where, we'll just buy components, that should be interoperable and system integrate them in our own solutions. But it's a good question. And I do think, in a world of other drone manufacturers or other drone systems, arguably the base ecosystems, meaning the Pixhawk universe, or Ardupilot universe, or Betaflight universe. All of these subsets have been driving the development of the software stack, autopilot stack, or flight controller firmware stack towards hardware agnostic solutions to a point where, okay, everybody's running on STM, but like on, on a module level. So I think it's also in specifically in the drone world this approach is actually, giving up on the possibility of competing with DJI which was a fair conclusion up until couple of years ago with decoupling and everything.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">From your perspective, how did we end up in the drone industry where we are today, where DJI dominates in a polarized market, dominating both in terms of growth and product quality, while drone companies in the West are having a hard time competing both in performance and price.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think first of all, we need to agree that DJI is just an amazing engineering company, being started by an amazing founder who relentlessly pursued certain goal and would not accept compromises and infuse the company culture with that sort of attitude. And then, going back, I think again, I'm going to go back to what for me was the pivotal moment in the development of the drone market is 2014, 15 3D robotics coming out with the Solo and then DJI countering with the Phantom. I think that was the turning point where all of us users were finally, able to get a really cheap and highly performant vehicles, drones. And DJI has proven that they're going to be super tough to compete with. And, at the time 3D robotics was one of the most funded Silicon Valley companies. And it was being run just like, pretty much every other Silicon Valley company was run, you do your design and your maybe prototyping on shore. And then, you build wherever it's cheapest. And I think it was the pace of innovation that, that was happening in that space, really just shown how having your manufacturing super close to where your R&amp; D is, that just sets you up, to innovate much more rapidly, to crunch those cycles that you can just out compete anybody else who's trying to do that onshore, offshore kind of approach. DJI started, in Hong Kong, having a vast ecosystem of service providers and manufacturing companies in that local ecosystem certainly helped, but I think this was the, deciding factor that then at the later stages, just, help them compound this advantage and really just, build massive distance between them and everybody else. And, they were just better at building amazing technology to a point where the difference in performance was such that nobody could compete with them. And if like we as work as a, as an FPV company, we felt that, when DJI entered the FPV space, which was incidentally just months after we launched our first product. And I like to say that this was a super scary moment. Imagine you're building an app and your app is, running on an Apple phone. And then Apple decides to, look into that space and all of a sudden that app is part of the standard Apple package. You're pretty much dead, right? So, it felt like that, big 800 pound gorilla, the DJI was entering in a tiny market, which was FPV at the time. And, they were basically able to leverage their influence and access to certain, certain parts of the hardware ecosystem in China in order to provide solutions that were simply out of reach for us. And specifically, this was like, custom built chips that did low latency video, over, over RF, and that was for any other company or almost any other company in the FPV space, that was just completely out of reach from the standpoint of existing know how, access to capital, et cetera, et cetera. So, this is basically an advanced version of what was happening back in 2014. It's just access to different aspects of, technology.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But DJI was also very aggressive in their pricing. If I recall back in 2015, with the Solo, the one that had the GoPro camera and the gimbal, that was priced around 1, 700, while the Phantom 3 Professional package was sold at the same time about 1, 300, but then, a year later, DJI brought the price down to 900 and then slashed previous year's models to as low as 500. And so that pretty much put every other company in the West out of business. And, perhaps because they saw software as an advantage or because it was out of necessity, but Western companies pivoted to software. It was very difficult to compete with that. So, yeah, I agree. It was. It was a very, bleeding edge, innovative product and culture, but it could afford to have such price cuts. And so from that perspective, how did the strategy of their vertical integration play into their ability to outprice the competition. Perhaps this is a good transition to talk about their business model of vertical integration, as opposed to what we see currently in the West and compare and contrast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's an interesting observation and, for me, when I was, looking at that, my first thought was, okay, what the hell they were thinking 3d Robotics pricing their, product at a price point that was higher than DJI, you know, fiercest competitor to begin with. And then, DJI it even went lower than the original pricing. So that, that, that was the first thing that they struck me. But I think that, this vertical integration playbook really benefited DJI at first on the logistics level and on a pricing level where they could simply afford to go down with price because they didn't have a guy that was doing all of their manufacturing that had to make their money. They were the guy. So they could just make slightly less than that. This was a luxury that Western companies could not afford. But later, this system integration really enabled them to produce systems that are simply much more performant. So it was not just the pricing power and the logistics of it, speed to innovate or the ability to slash prices and still make money. It's also if you are not just doing your own manufacturing, but also rather than system integrating components that are produced by other parties, you are actually building all those technology blocks yourself from the chip out and then, otherwise, and then from within the chip itself in, in, in this latest stage, right, that I referred to earlier, you can start to unlock all these little pockets of efficiency that sit between the black boxes that you would otherwise connect, being a system integrator. And it boils down to, in order for these subsystems to be compatible, they need to talk over certain protocols, which are designed for interoperability, not necessarily for efficiency, and they're always a compromise. And then, when you have the luxury of owning the black boxes, the two black boxes you need to integrate, then you can open them and you can tweak them and you can optimize for whatever you're optimizing for and then unlock a tiny bit of efficiency here, tiny bit of efficiency there. And when you look at across the whole system, these little efficiencies compound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Give us some specific examples of where that manifests in drone performance, because as you describe this history, something that jumps at me is how is it that this performance advantage persists nearly 10 years later? If we look in the smartphone space, for instance, 10 years after the introduction of the iPhone, the hardware from competing smartphone manufacturers was all in the same league, right? They were all competing neck and neck. Whereas there's something about robotics or about drones or about this type of system that has enabled the first player and has enabled DJI to, not just have economies of scale, but to have what you're describing as a fundamental gap in performance versus what someone else could build using best of breed components that are available out in the rest of the market. You put those components together and you try and build a performant drone. It's going to fall short, and you're going to explain, hopefully, what that looks like today, and why that is, because I think that gets to the heart of the value of this integration, and it also gets to the heart of your first observation about the conventional wisdom that has been built up over the last few decades of how and why hardware commoditizes. Why is there a wrinkle in this space that challenges that conventional wisdom and leads you to a different conclusion? Let's get down to specifics and really unpack it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the parallel with, mobile phone, industry is a great one because both in, in small unmanned and smartphones, size matters, energy consumption matters and performance matters. And specifically thermals also matter, right? One of the, one of the interesting aspects where tighter integration can lead you to better outcomes than system integration, right. So I think it's a great, it's a great comparison and, In that world, in a mobile world, we have Apple versus others, just as we have DJI versus others in the small UAS world. And it just proves the point that, system integration will get you to a point but it will not bring you to the, the position of the number one player in terms of performance, right? And we're seeing the same thing play out in the smartphone world and in the UAS world. And I'm going to give you an example where this system integration, versus vertical integration really takes you to different levels, and that would be, low latency video as a sort of, specific use for a data link in a small UAS. In low latency video, and this is something that, that, we're very intimately, connected to because this is something that we've pursued and tried to compete with DJI in the FPV world, so we know that really well. In low latency video, there are certain quite different technology blocks that you need to integrate very tightly. And and in this case, system integration, like, it goes one level deeper. It's not system integrating a radio module and a video processing module. It's basically done on the chip level. So if you're not doing your own chips, you need to get a chip that's going to do your video processing, perhaps host to radio, then you need to get your chip, which basically is your baseband chip, right? And the problem with that, and it's that level of system integration. So it's like chip, not board level, but chip level system integration. And in this particular case, neither of those chips have been designed for this particular application. if you're really doing ultra low latency stuff, as we did in the FPV world, in the consumer FPV world, our, measure of latency was in milliseconds, single digit milliseconds. So, like, we need it to be below 30 milliseconds, glass to glass. When the photon hits the sensor to when the photon emits from the display on the other end, that needs to be 30 milliseconds or less.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>22:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Just for clarity, that's important for the human pilot flying the drone to have that sense of instantaneous transparency through to what's happening with the drone. That's where any sense of delay just disappears. Is that what you're\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>23:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, to go to, to frame that further, like, flying, consumer FPV, either racing or freestyle, human is very tightly, embedded in the control loop. The drone is not stabilized in any meaningful way. You are keeping it level by throttling it more or less. So, so you really need, with your eyes, you perceive the response, dynamic response of the airframe and you're providing the control input. It's pitch and roll or it's yaw or it's throttle, which is, arguably the most sensitive part for most of the new pilots, right? Throttle control. So, with low latency video, the lower that latency is, the more tightly you can be embedded as a pilot. You can be embedded into that control, right? This is why latency is important. And, it was funny because when we were thinking about latency, low latency in the rest of the world would be below thousand milliseconds. And there we were counting single milliseconds in order to, acquire frame from the sensor, put it into memory, read it from memory, encode it, compress it, packetize, you know, again, memory write, and then again, make it into a packet, send it off to a radio, and then radio needs to be transmitted, right? So, we're counting milliseconds and, all of these chips are really made for a user experience which operates in a sub second world, half a second here or there, Great example is, encoders, decoders. Like, we're talking about SOCs that have video encoders and decoders. They are made to consume or originate media in an embedded device. Not necessarily to be super fast and super efficient at encoding video and sending it at high frame rates and counting latency in, in milliseconds. So, if you have any latency, you're gonna buffer. And, that you've problem solved. Nobody's gonna, nobody's gonna, notice. So, first of all, like, if, when you start selecting those SOCs and you start asking questions to chip vendors, okay, how fast, yeah, we have a, encoder that's capable of doing, X. Okay, how fast does it compress a frame of certain, resolution? They don't know. They don't care. They don't have that metric, So this tells you that, we're trying to use a chip for an application that was not even like an afterthought to folks. And then on the radio level, on the radio SOC level, like, if you want to be, affordable for consumer space as we want it to be, you need to go commodity and commodity in this world means, Wi Fi SOCs, 802. 11 as a standard is not optimized for that kind of latency. It's optimized and it's designed for, interoperability and coexistence. We need to have a number of 802. 11 APs and station devices that, that, need to coexist in the same space. So they, they need to be able to negotiate how they access the spectrum, and not stamp on each other. That's not what resilient, low latency, radio for unmanned applications is. It's all about, consistently and robustly being able to transmit video packets without interruption to the ground station. And again, you're trying to make that radio chip do something that it has not been designed for and all that firmware that's not been designed for. So like, you're having to make compromises. Or go off standard if you can, which you can't because, the volumes that we're doing are so small that all these chip vendors are not paying attention. So, you end up making all these compromises, which then result in a performance that's suboptimal. Whereas, if you had the full control over the entire black box that is the chip and the hardware encoder, and the black box that is the radio, piece, the 802.11 chip, you would be able to, go into that black box, tweak what you need to tweak, make the two black boxes talk to each other seamlessly and efficiently, and without losing a step. And that's how you get the performance system. And which makes the difference between DJI's video link and everybody else's video link. They had the opportunity to, go into those black boxes and access to those black boxes. Whereas rest of the world had to deal with wiring the black boxes, whether the wires are literal wires or they're traces on a PCB, it ends up being the same thing, right? That's a great example of how, being able to integrate tightly outperforms system integration.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Especially in the absence of standards that emphasize the performance qualities that your market needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Now, how do you balance developing proprietary protocols that you need to optimize the overall system, how do you balance that with the need to interoperate in, call it the modern battlefield or in a commercial ecosystem?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's also, that's a great question. I think, the higher up you are in, the, you can draw parallels with the OSI layers, higher, how much higher are in, in those layers, it's easier to be interoperable and the lower you are to the bare metal, it's hard to be interoperable. And the reason I'm saying that is, you know, maybe you will want to do hardware that's, It's gonna be compatible with the Pixhawk universe, so your hardware needs to be somewhat interoperable, in order to be compatible with, with, Autopilot stack. But then again, you also want some proprietary stuff running there. so it's really, this is one of the challenges of building a hybrid, solutions that combine your proprietary stuff to, open source stuff, if that makes sense. So this is a very tough balancing act. And again, it leads to compromises, but the thing that's, that, suffers is that full compatibility.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So given the benefits of vertical integration how do you explain that, outside of a few companies like Orqa like Skydio, like Autel, I don't know, perhaps there's some others that you would like to mention, but how come that there are relatively few companies who are pursuing this vertically integrated model?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think first of all, vertical integration in the small UAS world is super hard, and this is because there are so many constraints, space, energy, swap in general. And there's a wide variety of different technology blocks, really, very disparate technology blocks that you need to, command in order to basically be in a position to system integrate, right? So, ranging from radio on one end of the spectrum to, I don't know, propulsion on the other. Completely different problem sets, but also interrelated in how they can affect each other in a very tight and confined space, which is a small universe. So, I think that like the threshold to, to actually be able to, start system integrating is pretty high in terms of like, simply starting from the number of different teams that you need to have in order to, to get started down that path. And I think, the type of talent that's required for certain technology blocks in this group, that they could be considered exotic, from the standpoint of like the current talent pool that the West is operating on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you have any observations more broadly on this market dynamics and how it is dividing into different segments where one segment is companies that are taking off the shelf components and putting them together for custom use cases, as we will in this discussion call them system integrators versus some that are vertically integrated, and then also, a handful of others that are also vertically integrated, but also very focused on a specific mission, like Manna like Wing for instance. How do you make sense of this segmentation of the market and the dynamics playing out in the future?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I do think that there's always going to be need for system integrators. If you think of the long tail of applications, a lot of these applications in the long tail are going to be much more efficiently and perhaps effectively served by specific system integrated solutions. And this is why I do believe in a long term persistence of component ecosystem, which will serve a diverse and innovative space of system integrators that will go after these, more or less exotic or like, all of these applications in the long tail. And I'm a firm believer in that. And, there's also, this angle of like the solutions that are addressing the head of the distribution, like, your Matrice or your Mavic, they're going to be great for 95 percent of applications or 90 percent of applications. And that, they're not going to be that great for the rest 10 percent of applications, right? So, there's also that aspect of how useful is your Swiss Army knife? So, in a way, this is like going back to semicon. This is why, all those chips that we end up having to use, are not that great for some, niche applications, like, low latency video, or radio, right? So, so, this is the same, this is the same type of dynamic. So I do think that there's going to be, a vibrant ecosystem of, system integrators that are going to be served by hopefully as vibrant ecosystem of component providers. there's going to be demands for interoperability. And, you know, to counter myself, this is going to be driving towards commoditization because you don't have to have this interoperability and, commoditization there I can accept happening. But if we talk about the head of the curve and really going after these most frequent, most, numerous applications, then in this space, we're going to have fierce competition in performance between the players that are able to vertically integrate, and not only to vertically integrate their supply chains, being able to compete on the economics, but also quickly integrate their R&amp; D, being able to dig deep into those black boxes, integrate them tighter, unlock those pockets of, efficiency that will compound into a higher performance over the competition. And in the small UAS world, that means flying longer. That means, safer mission. That means easier operation, all these things that kind of, make an overall user experience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Can you give a, perspective of near term market size for the component manufacturers, for the system integrator, for the service delivery company.

This low latency video comes from this niche consumer FPV space, which is where, the pressure cooker of consumer FPV where Orqa was born. But, outside of that, at the moment, like, your typical unmanned, remote operation scenario is not that, latency sensitive. Now, the lower the latency is the more dynamic remote operation scenario you can tackle. And, I think it's like one of those things where what's possible technologically, really defines what applications can be, but for the most, remotely operated or like, and even autonomy, right, Everybody's talking about autonomy, whether it's land based or aerial. In any massively fielded autonomous system, there's always going to be a percentage of edge cases where a human operator is going to need to intervene to get the bot out of the situation. Even in, in like, ideal world of autonomy, there's always going to have to be an option to remotely operate. Remote operation is integral part of the autonomy stack because you will need that. Even five percent of edge cases creates a necessity for hundreds of thousands of hours of remote operation. And then the latency of your video is going to allow you more and more dynamic situations, if that makes sense, right? But one thing I'm going to tell you what we were pitching back when we were kind of goggle company and low latency, you know, this was, you know, 90 percent of our stack, we were pitching this kind of remote reality as opposed to virtual reality, which is a technology enabling, an operator a immersive experience of remote real world setting, in a way that would enable the dynamic interaction scenario. So you, it would actually allow you to interact with remote environment. But I think that's still in, in an SF realm, in an SF domain. no,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, in autonomous systems, as most of us have been thinking about them, and the community has been working on them, you'll have video as a sensor, but a lot of processing of that data will be done right there behind the camera, and then only a very small amount of data is transmitted anywhere based on it. In this case, it's looking at, well, if you could transmit the full video, even over an RF link, even over a long distance, and you could do it at this type of sub 30 millisecond latency, what are the implications of that? What does that enable? Whether it's a human on the other end that is consuming the video, okay, that's remote operations, we know about that. Or whether it is machines that are consuming the full video on the other end, is that a frontier that we're looking at? Does that have implications for how you coordinate massive numbers of automated systems and enable them to coordinate very closely together? Is this an enabler to that, or is this a nice to have?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I, I think you're onto something there because like, especially for smaller autonomous systems, if you can displace that power hungry, and hot running compute from a small thing that flies perhaps, then, you would need a way to, to get that, sensory input at lowest possible latency. And, it's much cheaper to run a video compression workload or video pipeline then it is to run a autonomy processing pipeline on a tiny thing that needs to be autonomous. So, so, there's certainly, displacing the compute, displacing the brain kind of thing, which is also an added, benefit to, to like having low latency.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So there have been attempts in the past for Western drone companies to displace DJI, or at least, come close to it in terms of market share, but none really achieved any meaningful, interesting success in scale.

And I think that the rest of the ecosystem, rest of the world is actually getting a second chance. And I hate to say it, it's part of the unfair advantage that us as Western drone companies have, DJI does not have access anymore to increasingly large swaths of market and applications, and this is creating a vacuum in which, you know, Western companies that are lagging behind in terms of, the performance capability of their system, that they can, try to compete amongst each other in filling that vacuum.

Yeah, well, probably, yes, they were subsidized extensively, but, we cannot hide from the fact that, they just did a marvelous job at engineering those solutions. And we have a chance to catch up, like collective West to catch up, leverage technology supremacy that we have in other fields, such as semicon.

And so we need to be able to create a Western superior product to the DJI. Who would you assemble? What would you assemble in order to be able to put something together that's better and price competitive?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I strongly believe in the possibility of the DJI of the West. I mean, this is, this is our, this is the premise that, that Orqa is building our future five, 10 years. We think that we can grow into a DJI of the West. But I'm a strong believer in DJI of the West having a strong presence both in United States and in Europe. And I believe that being able to serve those two markets, in, in full sense of the word, like being able to have customer intimacy, being able to have strong presence, and being able to, share identity. And then not, it's not just like, Orqa as European company opening offices in the States. It's also about being deeply embedded into the respective ecosystems. I do think that, strongly believe actually that, this is the way to build a DJI Out West. Have a very strong presence in both of these ecosystems on both sides of the Atlantic and, be able to, to really, serve customers on both sides of the Atlantic. And, when we talk about serving customers, there's going to have to be a, super tight integration especially if we talk about on the enterprise level, let alone defense, which is a story in and of itself, but even on the enterprise level, there's going to be, there's going to have to be a tight level of integration with all these aerial data collection devices and, how the data is being used and processed and decided upon, right. So, so, so, that requires, deep understanding of enterprises in their all specific shapes and forms on both sides of the Atlantic. Because, arguably there's a difference in how utilities operate in the States versus EU, for example, right? And then, you can look across all these other potential application areas. I'm not talking about how it's technically operating, but how they're organized, how they function and all these sorts of things. So I do think that this is like a strong advantage to a transatlantic player over any player that's going to be solely in US or solely in Europe, right? And learning from DJI Playbook, integration matters on the logistics point and pricing matters. And like, EU has done a tremendous job of reaching out to, more Eastern parts of the continent and integrating those economies and leveraging the beneficial costs environment. So, there's a good 10 to 15 years where this is going to be an advantage until we kind of level off. So there's going to be a substantial advantage of having a European, a specifically Central and Eastern European base, in being competitive on a cost level, both on R&amp;D side and the production side. So I think this is also an important factor.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Let's talk more specifically about the emergence of a credible DJI competitor. You mentioned a couple of catalysts. One being the, vacuum that's been created by the DJI ban that's been growing in, in scope and we'll see how that discussion ends, but we haven't talked about Ukraine, which is another great catalyst for the entire industrial base. In a world that looks much different than back in 2015 in terms of the maturation of the industry, the components, the supply chain, will the winning playbook be the DJI playbook, or will the maturation of the market and the technologies needed to put together a system like that, will that create an opening for another playbook?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think that, Ukraine and War in Ukraine is a massive, contributor to this, to this dynamic in unmanned, especially aerial system, small UAS and if you think about it, it's a perfect storm. On one hand, like you have these large swaths of market that are not accessible to DJI, primarily in the defense and security sector, primarily defense, and then later leaked out onto the law enforcements and security and critical infrastructure, et cetera. And then on top of that, you have this profound revolution in how defense thinks about UAS combined and, reinforced, right? So, so, before Ukrainian war, defense thought about UAS in terms of fixed wing systems, predominantly half a million, thereabout price point operated on a relatively high echelon of command. And what Ukraine is proving very graphically today is that the bulk of utility of unmanned actually comes from small UAS copters, multi copters, operated on the lowest echelon of command and deployed in massive numbers. And then, if you combine that, like massive need for small copters in the defense sector, and then, defense sector itself being sterile of DJI, like, this is like a complete no go zone, like, maybe there's a gray area in law enforcement, arguably, law enforcement agencies still could use DJI in Europe, but in defense, no way. Right. So the defense is like completely free of DJI competition for all of us other companies. So, these two dynamics are creating a perfect storm for a step up, massive step up in demand for the types of solutions that, would be provided by would-be DJI competitors and providing this initial momentum that will drive the, innovative cycle. So I think, even without the Ukrainian war, this dynamic and this kind of DJI West playbook became viable. The Ukrainian war just cranked it up to 11, really.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So fair to assume that a number of companies will come in and rush to get into and fill that vacuum. How do you expect the competitive dynamics to evolve on each of the segments? Let's look at, the consumer, the defense, the enterprise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So for consumer, I think, we have to look at different segments of consumer. There's like a, retail, consumer, market, which is, basically still, open for competition and DJI is untouchable there simply in terms of performance, the price, pricing power, it's the obvious choice for the consumer. Now, if we talk about educational segment of consumer type products, that's a different story because again, especially in US, this is also an area where Western companies have this unfair advantage that we can leverage in order to get business, be able to reinvest in R&amp; D and provide solutions that are going to be fully Western made. So, there's these two different sectors. And we as a company, we're looking at educational space where we can provide fully Western made solutions. And then we look at really some niches where we can compete on a purely technological and pricing basis. Now, enterprise is still, I believe, somewhat contested, although I've heard examples where, companies are really reluctant to go for DJI or Chinese solutions. So, this gives an unfair advantage to, to, Western companies. I think this is going to be contested, and it's going to be harder to compete with solutions that are not, as performant as DJI, however you want to measure performance. But I do think that, as opposed to consumer, you will still be able to sell a good enough solution. You know, you don't need to be better, you just need to be good enough to be able to sell. And there's like a large portions of that enterprise market where this is going to be the case. And then defense is, defense is purely like, it's going to be, and it's not going to be, it is right now the space where we're going to see most of, the business, happening for Western drone companies, in the small UAS or multicopter space, which is typically dominated by DJI. I'm not talking about Fixed Wing type platforms. We have a lot of great companies operating in that space across the board, talking about really small copters.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What are the major cost drivers for developing a small UAS system? What we hear is that for performance that is, somewhat approaching DJI's performance, you can get that from a Western drone OEM for three, four, five times the price, depending on, on, the specific use cases, et cetera. Can you generalize the major cost drivers and how certain catalytic forces like the Ukrainian war and the broadening of the industrial base, how that might impact those prices?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think volume is the dominant one. I don't think that prior to Ukraine, there was a conceivable scenario where a Western drone company would be in a position to sell a lot of copters to government users. Now with Ukraine happening, what we're seeing is a lot of, Western defense, end users are waking up to the fact that copters are going to be needed and copters are going to be needed in large volumes and copters are going to be used in an attritable manner. You deploy them and you're going to expect to lose them within three missions. So you better stock up on them. And not just that, you better invest in a capability, churn them out in large numbers, should you need them. Now this is a major contributor to, to really willingness to buy, willingness to invest in this capability, and like in the capability to, to develop these technologies, right, and support, Western companies and giving them business and contracts, et cetera. So I think volume is the main, you know, this understanding that, small UAS, small copters, that's, if you look at Ukraine, like this is all Mavic and Autels are the workhorses of the battlefield on both sides. And we as a collective West do not have a solution that's comparable to either.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You've been an early and leading player in the FPV segment, which now has emerged, or has grown from a very niche to volumes that dwarf any other segment. So can you talk about how you've experienced this evolution and kind of the trends that you're seeing and how you see the future?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's interesting because, before the war, we, had all these different strategies on how to popularize FPV because, you had to explain to people what FPV is. And for very unfortunate reasons, FPV has arguably become a household word now. And, you know, how that plays out, and I'm talking as a company that, that was started as a hobby company, consumer company, how that plays out and how FPV is perceived after the war, you know, it's anybody's guess. And I'm not entirely comfortable as FPV enthusiast, I'm not entirely comfortable with that situation. I don't know whether FPV is going to exist after the war, or, will we be able to fly FPV as civilians after the war. So I'm not entirely comfortable with that. But what Ukraine started is like, it showed how effective, consumer grade technology can be in a modern war. And that's the, I think the most impactful part of the whole dynamic that, that developed because, what's being used in Ukraine is essentially a hobby grade, technology that's incredibly accessible from the cost perspective, from the technological perspective, you need a bit of skills to build, and quite a lot of skill to operate, this type of vehicle, but nevertheless, super accessible. Like I cannot be expected to build a Javelin myself in my garage, but I can build an FPV in my garage. And with an FPV, I can probably hit a tank at a greater distance than I can with a Javelin. And I can bill it for like, what, 300, 500? And, Javelin is what, hundreds of thousands? So, this gives you an idea of how much disruption happened\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Can you just describe first person view? What is it? What's its value? What happens if somebody doesn't have an FPV capability for those who may not know as much about the market?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So FPV stands for First Person View. It's what we used to call our hobby prior to the war. FPV today stands for a first person view, manually controlled, quad captor. That is a radio controlled, a drone that's capable of carrying an explosive payload and it's operated fully manually, like as you would a race drone, by a skilled operator. And, this is basically, you can fly a drone for, a couple of kilometers and you can, strike an armored vehicle, which costs in millions with an asset that's, you know, the, some people call it an, like a flying IED that, that costs like hundreds of bucks, to build. And, we've seen a lot of companies coming up, in that space, being a component provider, we could see a lot of Western companies coming into that space, but in reality, Ukrainian war in particular, although that created a lot of interest in the West and that, created a lot of companies that are looking in that space, realistically, this again, was dominated by Chinese companies who were well placed, to serve both the needs of Ukraine and Russia in providing either components or build systems. And I think, if you look at, how various Western companies performed and Orqa included, trying to compete in that space, like again, we collectively couldn't compete with the Chinese on, on, on prices. And I don't think we should, because longterm, I think that FPV is specific to Ukraine and it's a phenomenon that's, indicative of absence of other means of strike by both sides, and, whether, strapping an explosive ordnance to a copter, whether that's going to be a optimal way to do precision strikes, that's anybody's guess. And my guess is, you know, probably there are more optimal ways to perform strikes, kinetic strikes. But what I'm certain of is that copters are the optimal way to provide battlefield transparency, the type of which we're seeing in Ukraine right now. And, as much as I don't think that the FPVs as a strike capability are going to stay here post Ukraine, I'm 100 percent certain that copters, which may or may not be FPV and arguably don't need to be FPV, will persist as a principle way to provide situational awareness and battlefield transparency, in the future. I'm not saying that the fixing platforms are going to be done, but I'm saying that, we're still going to have these fixing platforms operated on a higher echelons, but we're going to see much more copters being operated on a very low command levels. The challenge is going to be really collecting all of the data and then processing it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What have you observed in terms of how FPVs are being employed in Ukraine? How has it changed since early 2023 to today? What do you see coming in the future, and what is it about that that makes you think that FPVs are perhaps unique to the Ukraine conflict and that they're not going to continue to evolve in this way for future conflicts that they'll be supplanted by something else. I think that there are people out there with, the assumption that this evolution, what we're seeing in Ukraine is going to continue and that Western militaries across the spectrum are going to be rearming with, massive numbers of FPVs and incorporating these into their tactics as a lesson from the war. But if you have a different view on how that's going to look, walk us through that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Oh, yeah. I think, if, if you wanna have the nitty gritty realities of use of FPV in Ukraine, I strongly advise, listening to War on The Rocks, podcast and Russian Contingency where, Rob Lee and Mike Kaufman are really, delivering direct from the battlefield experience of FPV operators. And this is very detailed and highly informative in terms of tactics. So, what we're observing, is basically there's, some cat and mouse development in terms of electronic warfare countermeasures and being able to deploy these systems, freely, so there's a big change between, what was working at the early stages of war to what's working now. We're seeing a lot of, evolution in terms of how the electronic warfare measures are deployed and how the, systems are evolving to, be able to, operate in the presence of, electronic warfare. So there's that. These FPV systems are being, operated in an increasingly larger numbers. And basically both sides have been very successful in adopting those and evolving the tactics of their use. But ultimately I think, again, this is a specific for Ukraine because, simply because barring, drones, FPV drones and drones in general, and the anti air systems this is a very low tech war, ultimately. And, these FPV systems are being applied in a, a bolt on manner. And whether I'm seeing FPVs that are being used in Ukraine right now being used by, uh, in this form by Western NATO member countries, I would say no. Just starting from the fact that once you power up the drone, you're broadcasting unencrypted video feed to whoever cares to tune in. Like, just start from that. And, this goes from the fact that because of the latency, and because of the EW resiliency, you're compelled to operate an analog video system, and there's no efficient way to encrypt or scramble analog video system, just that, that leaves you with having to broadcast your mission, to whoever wants to tune in in the vicinity. So, so there's that. Also, like, I don't think that we should be falling into a trap of thinking that these are super efficient systems simply by looking at social media. And this is one thing that, that really, repeated by the people who had the chance to really observe how these systems are being employed. Like the efficiency numbers are super, super low. because. If we look on the social media, we're just seeing the strikes, but, then there's a massive, positive selection, happening there, right? So you will not see unsuccessful strikes being posted on Twitter and, you know, all the FPV pilots, from before the war, they know that, whenever you fly, you turn on the DVR because, if you lose a drone, that's how you find it by looking at the DVR footage. You can imagine that if every FPV mission is filmed and the operator has the footage, then you could even, say that we have seen every successful strike that happened, right? And we can be fairly certain that most of the successful strikes have been actually recorded. And in the world of social media and viral dynamics, this creates a powerful echo chamber where we all think that this FPV is this super efficient new asset, which, you know, we really have no grounds on making that conclusion because we don't know how many unsuccessful ones there have been for every successful one that we see. So, this second piece is efficiency. Third piece is, FPVs are really hard to operate. It takes a lot of skill, and this was one of the barriers to entry to the hobby before the war, which we were facing as a consumer company, like it's really hard to get people to remain and then to persist in the hobby long enough so they can enjoy it. Like, you really need to struggle before you get the skill and you can actually enjoy flying because it's not that easy. And I have hard time imagining, FPV being deployed in a big army sense. I can totally imagine it being deployed in a highly specialized manner. So, I can totally imagine FPV being a part of a special operator's toolkit, like that skill set, right? So, you train for a sufficient time, you become a great pilot. And then this gives you almost superpowers, right? And then arguably this can be a, a Special Ops thing rather than a big Army thing. Then again, simply the logistics of, deploying large number of FPVs is a stretch to be, you know, diplomatic. I mean, I'm going to give you an example. Whenever we would go out and fly for fun, there was always problems with frequencies and 5. 8 band, which is where you, where your video operates is very narrow. So you effectively have eight channels. And if you go out with a group of friends, like five or six of you, it's a logistic nightmare to make everybody stick to their own frequency. Right, so you always have this situation you're flying and somebody plugs in and they're on your frequency so all of a sudden you can't see anything. So trying to extrapolate that experience to a chaos of war where there's not only your side trying to deploy these missions en masse. There's adversaries trying to deploy these missions, like it's a nightmare. it adds to that thing about how efficient it really is, this question. So, compounding these five, different aspects of, like, reality of FPV I don't think it being used massively for strike. What I am, again, I'm going to say it, what I'm seeing this Ukrainian war changing in a way, how, army uses, copters is this situational awareness, mass deployed, highly attritable platforms for, defense applications. And, as an FPV company, we get a lot of, oh, FPV is the big in Ukraine. you guys, must be selling hundreds of thousands. And I'm like, no, the only ones making money in this FPV space in Ukraine are Chinese companies that, that perhaps they were making ready to fly drones in maybe single digit thousands per batch. I can totally imagine a lot of these companies doing tens of thousands per month, easy. And that led, funnily enough, that led to the commoditization. the price per system is like 500 bucks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Isn't there an argument though that technology will continue to innovate and try to close some of the gaps that you were talking about, whether this is better use of the RF spectrum, better, digital data links that are also resilient to EW, better logistics, better deployments, better ways for humans and machines to interface. Isn't that a valid argument that this arc of technology evolution will continue and make FPVs relevant in the future? Or if not, how do you see that arc continuing to evolve?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and I would add increasing automation of the flight control itself. All of those things, what would you want to see in terms of changes across that spectrum of technologies that would change your conclusions?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, I think, one of the gaps, certainly is, spectrum management. It's also EW resiliency for the high throughput data links, and video arguably is a high throughput data link. It's very hard to sustain sufficient data throughput over an RF data link for digital video. If you think that even 10 percent package loss of a compressed video is total, video loss. That's, super hard to sustain even in a congested RF environment, let alone contested RF environment. So, so, that, that's going to have to change in order for, these systems to be viable and a prerequisite for like, I think wider adoption, FPVs is going to have to be moving away from freely broadcasted analog video, which all of the FPVs you're using both in defense and in the hobby are being used, are using right now. I can totally see a benefit in adding automation and autonomy to these systems. It's gonna reduce the barrier to entry for skill required to operate. It would not have to be a matter of dexterity and ability to, to really, fly and, skill it's gonna, it's gonna be learned and it's gonna, you'll be able to learn more efficiently. But also, and I'm going back to this point of whether copters are the right strike vehicle. And that's always this thing that I'm coming back to. And I know that this trope of swarm of drones is a very attractive one, but have you ever seen how drone light shows are being deployed? It takes a stadium to set them up. So you're literally setting up an acre of drones almost in order to deploy a light show. So this trope of having swarms of drones attacking, like you would be, you, there, there's a lot of logistics that needs to go in, in deploying a large number of drones. And if one thing that we've learned about this war is that in a transparent battlefield, you need to reduce your logistic footprint, not, so, so in, in a way, we're going to have to, innovate, like collective we, we're going to have to innovate heavily in order to come up with a smaller footprint for deployment swarms, if we want to make swarms a thing. And then it brings me to the question, is copter really a great platform for strike? Or are there more, like, compact, efficient platforms to deploy strikes at that distance with that type of payload. And again, I have to go back to saying, expressing an opinion that, I think that both Ukraine and Russia are using FPVs as a matter of necessity and accessibility. It's more of an accessibility thing, because all you need is 500 bucks of Chinese components, some carbon, and explosives, to be able to affect a, precision strike beyond line of sight. And that's it. and, couple that with virality of the footage that, we established is recorded for every mission by default, because this is what you do as an FPV pilot, you DVR everything. Like, when you add that two things together, like, you get this impression that, oh, it's a massive thing, whereas, reality might be completely different. But what we are seeing is, a lot of Western forces are, working to, acquire these capabilities to, learn how to deploy them, learn how to use them, learn how to defend against them. And I think this is going to be here to stay, but I think that, this is a starting point and it will necessarily evolve and what's the end state, the, final form of it. Anybody's guess. And I'm really not. even, arguably being an insider and understanding, this, deeply because, we were doing it before it was cool. I wouldn't dare to venture where it lands, like, what's going to be the final shape of the strike vehicle, and I'm not sure it's going to be a copter. On the contrary, I'm kind of willing to place a bet that it's not going to be. Where I'm willing, again, 100 percent to place a bet is like for, low level ISR situational awareness, there's hardly a better thing than a copter.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Srdjan what's the message that you'd like the audience to take away from this discussion?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, two messages, like, first of all, building small things that fly, it's super hard. And people should be aware that, although there is a massive, advantage of vertical integration versus system integration, we should not underestimate system integration because that in itself is also super hard to do right. So I think, ultimately if there's like one or two things, this would be that, this is hard, this is very hard. And, people that are doing this right now, are really, the barrier to entry is quite high.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Excellent.

The viability of it has been proven very clearly. That this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think there has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space podcast and our conversation with Bobby Healy, CEO and Founder of Manna Drone Delivery. Bobby was a standout guest when we had him on the podcast back in March of 22, and we're delighted he could join us for a return visit today. Returning guests, give us such a cool perspective. They provide an update on the original assumptions and actual outcomes of the last two years. And with Bobby drone delivery overall, and more specifically Manna Drone Delivery, he reminds us of the original assumptions, what has actually occurred and what's been pleasant and disappointing surprises and how he sees the future and perhaps differently than his original assumptions. For those of who know Bobby and listen to his original conversation, you know he's a compelling, articulate industry veteran and accomplished aviation business professional. He's both a person who understands the technology and its application, and combines this with decades of aviation knowledge. And highly successful aviation technology implementation. This isn't always the case with some of the innovators and leaders in advanced air mobility. And it's perhaps one of the reasons more our app to bet on Bobby's projects and his vision for the future. And as we do with all guests, we listened to their important messages and we politely challenge their core underlying assumptions. And we've done the same with Bobby. Listen to what Bobby says is the killer app for drone delivery. Do you agree? He provides details with market size and price, which is refreshing. He talks about the value of B2C versus B2B in drone delivery. This in itself would make for a good podcast discussion as a lot of companies are focusing on B2B delivery. One of Bobby's essential messages is that the economics have now been proven for this space. Listen to his discussion of business and operational profitability. As we all know, getting to profitability is a challenge for any business. And it has been particularly challenging for some in advanced air mobility. Listen to how we discusses how Manna wants to power big and small brands directly. As an example, he has a deal with Coca Cola, where he flies their products. He discusses how he simply wants to replace the road and that consumers will and should never go back to road based delivery. If you listen carefully, you'll hear why Bobby has been more successful than others. I was a bit surprised by technology is actually deploying in house versus what others would hope he would purchase from outside technology providers. And finally listen to where Bobby believes advanced air mobility investments should be made beyond drone delivery. His answers may or may not surprise you. So many, thanks to Bobby for rejoining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our talk with Bobby Healy as you innovate and generate profits in The Vertical Space. Bobby kicked off his career building video games for Nintendo. He then founded Eland technologies an airline technology company, which he sold 12 years later to SITA. He then built Car Trawler the world's largest mobility marketplace for airlines over 15 years and led two successful LBOs for the business. For the last four years he's been building Manna a\"Drone Delivery as a Service\" business, whose mission is to improve the world by making lightning fast, suburban deliveries, affordable green and safe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, welcome back to The Vertical Space. We first spoke in March of 2022 and so we thought it would be great to bring you back and talk about the drone delivery industry and what has changed there, as well as what has changed with Manna. A lot of things have changed. So time to debunk some myths.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And it's great to be here again, guys. I'm really looking forward to it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Perfect. As you know, we typically ask if there's something that few in the industry agree with you on, would you amend your original answer or something else that's on your mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">If you look at my LinkedIn, you'll see that argument or the main arguments play out. Most people assume, not people in our industry, but generally people think that the use case is critical products, medical, defibrillators, urgent, societally beneficial products, and they are great use cases for sure. But the economic reality is that coffee and takeaway food is the killer app for what we do. That's one thing that most people, they don't disagree, they're just uninformed. They haven't done the work or the research that we've done on where the market opportunity is. And then the second one kind of hand in hand with that is a lot of people believe again, incorrectly that the unit economics or the capital economics don't work right now that they will at some point in the future when some magical technology comes along to make them work. But that's where I find, I enjoy myself the most on LinkedIn answering some of the people that have, raised those questions because I mean, I have the data, we have the flights, we're operating with profitable economics now. And I do enjoy engaging with people on the many misconceptions that are in our industry. And thankfully, we've already debunked them, not in theory or research. We're actually flying the debunk, even today as we speak we're flying aircraft in Dublin that are running profitable unit economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I would add that even when we talk to industry insiders, there is a tendency to think that B2B delivery use cases will be the ones that scale first, or at least if you asked them a couple years ago. There was a general tendency to believe that urgent cargo, high value not necessarily high volume movement will be the one that gains traction initially, especially because of the, arguably easier safety case to build with predetermined points in the network, as opposed to ad hoc, don't really know where the next order will come up, low value, you know, how in the world can you make money, delivering coffee and meals, et cetera, et cetera. Yet, as we often discuss on the podcast, those use cases didn't really scale past POCs and pilots, globally, whereas the, B2C delivery, the kind that Manna is doing is really starting to show some interesting inflection.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I agree. In the end we're running an infrastructure and that infrastructure is an airline. It's a cargo airline. And just like any other airline, utilization is a key factor in the profitability of that airline. And every airline in the world talks about load factor or utilization in our world. And you don't get that with high priority, critical goods, the volume just isn't there. So there's no world where you can make, those critical medical type deliveries a very interesting business from a commercial standpoint. And the other thing is you don't learn anything by doing that. Other than building an aircraft, you don't really learn anything. The real learning in serving the space we serve is in being in the trenches doing five, six hundred, a thousand deliveries a day out of a small car park and getting a 30 second turnaround time and embedding that learning into the software, into the hardware and iterating through that. So unfortunately, and there's a number of great players in our space that are doing and have done a really good job, pioneering job, I would say in medical delivery, but it doesn't translate in any way whatsoever to suburban, backyard, high throughput delivery. it's just two totally different paradigms and two different things to optimize.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Some of the guests we've had on have sometimes mentioned coffee delivery in a trivial way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Disparaging way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. And so, so when, as you're saying, listen, it's a, is it a good start for you? Is it a good proving ground for you? But can you scale and meet your financial projections that you want to hit in the next three years, delivering coffee?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already, every single coffee delivery we do is profitable. So 100 percent of them now, like we used to be at the weekends because we'd have higher utilization and then, weekdays were less so, but now our volume has diluted the fixed cost per location so they are profitable. And the thing about coffee is there isn't a product as popular on the planet for adults on a daily basis that has the adoption rate and the frequency and the gross margin that works so well that where the benefits of flying in a straight line as we do underwrite the new mode of delivering these products. So in a world where there's no such thing really as coffee delivery and people are now, I mean, you know, Starbucks or Starbucks drive thru is an example of Starbucks mobile app, people are absolutely addicted to, I would say, high consumption patterns, high frequency purchasing coffee. So of course it's going to be the best product. But now you say, people do trivialize it. Yes, only because I think not from a business sense, they're not saying coffee isn't a great product, but they're really saying, I think, is using the airspace to deliver a coffee seems like a bad idea to me. That's really what they're saying without saying it. And that's the purpose of I think regulation and the standards like Part 108 or in our case, U-Space in Europe, standards that are scalable that do allow high throughput in that airspace below 500 feet. And when we look at the market size we estimate that today there's 5. 2 billion food deliveries a year from the top four aggregators annually growing at 15%. So think DoorDash Uber eats all the way down and that's with a constrained market where there's a labor shortage, there's labor costs, economics problems, and there's a quality issue. So, so therefore those 5. 2 billion orders, road based orders are coming from customers that want it come hell or high water. Even if it's a bad customer experience and it's expensive. And the U S customer is paying nearly a 60 percent premium on basket value to get that pizza delivered. And they're never happy with it, but look, 5. 2 billion orders. So that's the current market. Our estimate puts it at a 16 billion order market without even trying, if we can remove the road from the equation and use aircraft. So you tell me one industry where you have probably a hundred billion dollar market staring at you in the face that's untapped, where the technology has proven we've already got positive uni economics. And the only thing between us and that giant market, I guess there's a social acceptance thing. You can't go too fast, too quickly. There's some regulatory, things still to unlock. But if you side that up beside blood delivery or vaccine delivery or whatever, it just dwarfs that space. And we didn't want to take on something easy. We wanted to take on the most impactful, space and that is everyday goods to everyday people in every suburban house on the planet profitably. And we're at the start of that now.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The other thing that strikes me about the coffee and the last mile consumer delivery is that you have the opportunity for a very consistent operation in order to make deliveries into all those customers in the market. By and large, they're already accustomed to ordering things from their phone from the ground based delivery aggregators. And in contrast, when we went and looked into the B2B medical delivery space, at least in the developed world, the companies face a pretty involved enterprise integration and organizational integration for each customer or each segment of customers. How is that flight operation going to work? Who is going to have the authority to initiate a flight? All of it ends up being a pretty heavy front load, cost and integration and it's heterogeneous operations as the business grows. Whereas in this it seems you already have a foundation of educated consumers accustomed to receiving deliveries via phone operations and it lays the groundwork for a reasonable path to go and scale a company to go and address that market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and there's no, enterprise sales process or there's no finding a budget somewhere in some hospital or some company's budget to try and do this innovative new mode. Our customers are the ones that are drinking the coffee. And they're abundant and they're aware of us and it's viral and all of these tailwinds to what we're doing that don't exist in the enterprise market. And then the other thing is we, again, we look at different densities. So European population density is much higher than US population density in suburbs. So for example, in Europe, we use a lot of motorbikes to move blood around between hospital critical to beat the traffic and it's very hard to justify, you know, why would you spend a large infrastructure budget and drones when the motorbike network's already there, largely run by volunteers. it's just sometimes forcing technology into a place where technology doesn't belong. Now different in Africa or, you know, countries that don't have transport infrastructure anyway. And of course there, you're not providing drone delivery. You're providing transport infrastructure. But there's already solid transport modes in most modern economies that are not as good as drone delivery, but they're not far off. So your benefits are marginal. And then you're incurring, as you said rightly, all this overhead of cold chain of all the trail of every part of the process for that sample or whatever it is. And then of course, toxic substances. a lot of the products you might want to fly in medical areas are considered hazardous substances, so, chemotherapy drugs is a great use case, but you're into a whole other area of risk there. And we just said, look, there's parts of that prize that we're interested in and we also liked the fact that it's a critical need to deliver those products, but at the same time, it comes with just such difficult challenges on the economic side of things that from my view, it's always going to be a business that's subsidized by something. And that's, I think, why it succeeded so well in Africa to date. And I think honestly, it's going to be challenged in other markets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I may say something really quickly, we can move on from this. As it relates to medical delivery, and in clinical pathology versus anatomic pathology, so blood versus tissue, I think an argument could be made that there's high volume of both, and tissue pathology will have a much higher critical factor, and there'll be a lot of price behind that, because there's a sensitivity to it where that may be a good market. I think they're both relatively high volume, but one difference between a cup of coffee is that the economics may not play out unless there's a lot of volume in the delivery. They're not going to pay a lot for one piece of blood, and I think one thing we discovered, Luka and Peter, on one of our podcasts was what's the real value of getting it there a little bit faster when it's a 24 hour turn on the testing anyway? But my sense is that the, and Bobby, in hospitals, labs, there's a very large cost item set aside for courier.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's a big element for labs. So maybe that's a next stage for you if the economics play out, but that meets a lot of your criteria, conceivably clinical and anatomic pathology, maybe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. I mean, I'd love to be, I'm not sure I'll be proven wrong here. What I'm, I guess in the end, what I'm saying is if you're going to build an infrastructure then you underwrite the cost of an infrastructure with a viable business case, and then all the other applications can work on top of that. So if you're already in a city or a suburb or whatever it is, and you're flying trivial products, albeit you're making money doing it, why wouldn't you then deploy that for other use cases? It could be beer. It could be medicine, like you say, samples, all of these things. And we can pick products up as well as drop them off. And why wouldn't you deploy? Of course you would. But you don't start with that because you're always going to be building a business that needs to be subsidized by something. And again, it comes back to ambition and scale. And for us, the ambition is unlimited. And we say, what is the biggest use case that we can solve? And it is, no matter what you say. It's always going to be the suburban household and their needs. And that's going to be what will underwrite the infrastructure for any successful player in this space. It ain't going to be medical.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>19:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, you talk about the potential to expand the market from what 5. 2 billion deliveries per year today with the ground based aggregators to something much larger. When you look at the differences that drone delivery brings into the equation, whether it's speed or environmental advantages or a safety case or cost, what do you see as being the key drivers that are creating the behavior change that leads you to think that there's a 16 billion a year, delivery opportunity?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">There's existing numbers that show adoption rates of road based delivery between 4 and 5% around the world and they kind of point to a low take up rate and there's our own data as well. and there's different states. I think that the restaurants are a small business. Think the consumer at the end of it all. And you look at the different things that they think are important. And in the case of the restaurant, restaurants frequently, they just can't, they can't get delivery, right? It's just too expensive. They can't do it themselves. The aggregators that power them, the, DoorDashes and Ubers and so on, that power them and themselves are constrained with output as well, if it rains, if the weather's bad in any way, or if it's peak time, you just can't meet the demand peaks, with people, it just doesn't work. So the result is batching, where multiple orders are put in with one driver and therefore cold food or terrible quality food and unpredictable times. And that's reflected in the NPS or the ratings of all of the aggregators, which are on the floor, not because they're not great businesses. They are, but they're constrained by just a limited output that they have. So why are we different? Because we're point to point. our average flight time is just less than three minutes. Physics is on our side. And when you have that advantage, the outcome is look, it's literally as simple as the outcome is hot food or hot coffee or, and in good condition. And that is remarkably the most important thing. It isn't speed. It will speed kind of translates into quality, but also reliability and predictability, which is as important as quality. People are willing to wait 15 minutes or 20 minutes. They are willing so long as that's what it is. But with batching and traveling, the traveling salesman algorithm, there's no way to be sure about that. So, so the variability is very poor. And so the consumer is going to modify their behavior because of drone delivery and the advantages it has. And we already see that in something as simple as coffee delivery. And before we existed, there was no such thing as coffee delivery in suburbs. That nobody would be crazy enough to do that because you won't make any money but yet our basket value in our coffee shop is more than twice the the basket value of the average order in the coffee shop itself, because behavior, right? It's a household order. So it's 2. 3 beverages per basket. There's a bunch of pastries and so on and then the other stakeholder for us, as I said, the vendor, the small business, they're looking at this saying they're now able to reach a couple of hundred thousand up to half a million customers in their catchment area of less than a five minute flight. And they're saying this is massive for their business. So. That's another stakeholder. And then the final stakeholder for us is the aggregator itself. And we'd expect our business is going to be, we call it B2B. And what we mean by B2B is we just want to be a delivery company. So we want to power the aggregators. We want to power the big brands. We have a deal with Coca Cola where we fly their products, but we want to power all of the big and the small brands directly, simply replacing the road. And so you think about the aggregators and their numbers are public. The aggregators lose money on most of their orders in suburbs because of the time it takes to deliver them and the labor costs and the labor laws. So we know the benefits to them are actually simply unit economics. we can do a delivery for them cheaper than they can do it themselves quite simply, and still make a strong margin ourselves because of our operating economics. So there's different stakeholders, but it, and some of them, it's about economics and some of them it's about experience and quality, and some of it, it's about growing the market. And by the way, the five to 16 primarily comes from number one is actually just widening the addressable market. So you're going from where the aggregators really only want to do very dense areas and quite short trips to obviously optimize their costs. We can now do much longer trips and support much less population dense areas. So you're actually widening the market to those like 92 million detached single family homes in the USA. And similarly in Europe, there's these really fragmented towns, suburb cities that aren't that easy to address for the traditional mode. So it's a combination of just customer behavior, I think, and market addressability.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, you answered the question, but I was going to ask if there are categories of products that people just wouldn't consider ordering via ground based delivery because they just know it's going to take too long, like a latte or something. And are you seeing that people will order those products given their expectation that it will arrive faster via a drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, we survey them as well. And quite interesting. If you look at lots of publicly available data, the key categories for road based delivery are, in order, if I just pick one market, the UK, where there's great data. And it's quite similar in the USA as well, but there's the top one is pizza. And then it's, other products like Indian or Chinese and burgers and fries is like fourth or fifth in the list of, perishable prepared meals. But actually if you ask people what they want to eat, burgers and fries is the number one thing. So what's going on there is people already know that certain products just don't deliver well, they don't travel well, and anyone that's got a road based delivery of burgers and fries knows that after 20 minutes, it's just toxic. So, so therefore you can't reheat it either. So, so consumers know not to order these things. So in the existing road based data, there's a hidden demand that's there that's not satisfied. We know that already from ours. And our number one, outside of coffee, our second one is probably tied between burgers and fries and ice cream. And an ice cream is an interesting one because you don't need a lot of choice in ice cream, right? You just need a quality, well known brand or two for the customer. But ice cream is interesting because it's 168 hours of the week almost, it's almost flat by hour of day of week. And it's driven by family orders, right? These are orders that have an experience associated with them, like a party or watching a movie or things like that. And the alternative is getting your car for 35 or 40 minutes to get the ice cream if you don't happen to have it. So we do see people now starting to rely on us for certain categories like coffee and ice cream that they might've pre purchased a week at a time and stored it in their fridge before, and now they just don't care cause they can get it from us and then the really the alarm bells, I think in a good way that ring for us is that burgers and fries in terms of meals are number one category. And finally, I would say people are saying, finally, I can get French fries. It actually tastes like French fries and they arrive. And I know that sounds trivial, but it isn't. It's the flagship product of McDonald's, right? I mean, French fries. I started this business because I wanted a bag of French fries and we call them chips in Ireland. I joke about it, but I did. And it's one of those, highly sought after products that delivery just fails.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>27:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I mean, Uber is a great case study in how an addressable market can expand when you introduce a new capability or a new user experience. I don't have the data to back this up, but I'm just basing this on my own consumption patterns and those close to me, but I'd be comfortable saying that a lot of Uber users their budgets for taxi and black cars prior to Uber were not the same as their Uber budgets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And the amount of music people consume now, it's Spotify. there's things that consumers never would have told you they wanted until you gave it to them and then they're absolutely reliant on it. It's like air and we'll be the same. We already are in the towns we operate in. It's just, people are blown away by the fact that they can get our service but at the same time, they straight away adjust to it and they start to get angry with us if we're 60 seconds late it almost feels like for some of them. So, so, and that's a good thing. it really is the end of road based delivery. When you offer this service, consumers never going back to road based delivery. And I think that's not unexpected. Our job has been at the engineering level to make sure that no matter what the weather is, they wouldn't need to go back. So that means flying in minus 20 C plus 42 C, very strong winds, I think 35 mile an hour winds, things like that, rain, obviously snow. And if you don't do all of those things and really from an engineering point of view, harden the product, you don't have a business. There's no point being a drone delivery business for fair weather because the restaurants and the customers that you're powering, they'll just, they just, if you, if they can't trust that you're going to always be there, you're a novelty, you're the circus. And that's not who we want to be. So you have to start with the very hardest of solutions and an engineer for that. And when I think about what advice I would give people, you can't start in this business with a halfway house. You have to have the final, picture solved. That's a mistake we nearly made at the start. And just by sheer luck, we happen to be in Ireland, which is the worst country in the world to do a drone delivery business, permanently raining, permanently windy. So therefore we can fly in any weather, but it comes back to, and it's very important. I know it sounds like engineering, but I'm trying not to be too engineering about this. But if you want to be real in drone delivery you have to replace the car fully. You can't be partial replacement. And that makes it much more difficult. The engineering equation is just much harder and the testing equation is much harder. Even the delivery mode, the way we deliver the software we've written for that arrival at the house and delivering, it looks simple. but it's not, it's quite the opposite. And then testing that out in the wild and, is one thing in a big field in the middle of nowhere, but testing it where there's customers underneath you, is a whole other thing. And that takes so much time. Sorry, I'm wondering, but it goes to what do you need to solve for, right? You need to solve for predictability, availability, speed equals quality, cost, unit cost, and yeah. So safety, I don't even talk about safety because you don't have a right to exist, if you're not safe and that comes down to, yes, we have governance because we're regulated by aviation regulators and a lot of oversight comes from that. But. It doesn't make you safe. There's a million ways to still not be safe, even if you're regulated. I think that comes from, there's a, there's an existential threat hanging over the industry if it's irresponsible when it starts to scale. And what that translates to, It took us five years and I don't think you're going to do much quicker than that. And when you start developing a backyard delivery product to, to really scaling it, which is where we are now, it's somewhere between three to five years timeline. And no amount of fantastic engineering, or engineers speed that up. It's a process of gradually evolving, crawl, walk, run more and more volume. You can't please the investors with this one. You have to manage them and let them know that it's a long, arduous process to make sure that you're safe. And I certainly see that in the industry, we've done a great job at that. I don't see anyone pretending that it can go, at blitz scaling pace, but it will, and I think there's a number of, operators like ourselves, like Wing, for example, Google's program that are now ready to start some really, serious growth in a safe way. So, but it is not your typical industry where a five year path normally to a startup, building a viable product with viable economics and the start of a revenue journey. That's very difficult, space by any measure. And so it'll come to what's the market look like in, in a decade, who'll be there, how many will be there, that kind of thing. Just because you mentioned the word safety, what it translates to is a market that's going to be a very few number of players with sufficient deep pockets and patience to get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, Bobby, delving into the customer experience a little bit more. Are you, guiding customers towards expectations for how long it will take for different categories of products to arrive from the time that they push order on their phone? What is a reasonable expectation for a latte versus a hamburger and fries versus other takeout food. Obviously the drone delivery operation itself is a consistent time period, but the preparation time and the other\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">what should customers be expecting?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. There's a very difficult problem to solve actually and the big aggregators have, have done the best job at this simply because of time and the data that they have. Truth is a restaurant that's preparing meals is a very unpredictable output line, particularly smaller ones. And from a day to day or hour to hour basis, quite difficult to predict. Now there's some very large brand players. I don't need to name names, you know, they are, but they can produce a meal every 20 seconds and they can get one through their drive through every 35 seconds. And so for those types of brands, we can tell the customer down to the minute when they can expect to see their nuggets or their fries or whatever it is land in their back garden, essentially for the others, and we have a number of vendors that are, they're a super product, but they're erratic to say the least. So we tell the customer it's a three minute flight or a two minute flight or whatever it is based on the range and the wind. And then we say, and the prep time for this restaurant is between five minutes and you know, with Google flights, you get this kind of bar chart of likely we give them a bar chart of likely arrival times based on the vendor's prep time. And we tell them what's happening as well. So they know in our app or through our API with our B2B partners, they know when the vendor started to prepare, they know when the vendors finished preparing, they know when we've received the goods from the vendor. They know when it's been loaded onto the aircraft. They know when the aircraft's taken off and then they can track it in real time. So the reason we do all of those things is the customer can always see progression and that's important. So the customer does not mind waiting 15 minutes 20 minutes for their burgers and fries, so long as you keep them updated on that progress. And so we measure time by stages, but if I look at my order to arrival time. So it's a time the customer pressed the purchase button to the arrival time. We see a range for products like our Coca Cola delivery, the median time for the aircraft to take off after the order is two minutes. Flight time is three minutes. So, so median time about five minutes all the way up to the premium, we've got this French guy that makes these, delicious sandwiches, but he takes 20 minutes to make the sandwich, but again, it isn't about the actual time. It's about the confidence in that time. And look, our NPS, our net promoter score is 86 year to date. And that's because we have this obvious advantage that we fly, but also we manage, as you say, the customer expectations very clearly. through constant messaging of progression of their\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay. So as you scale and demand increases, how do you keep customer expectations realistic? If it's coming up on lunchtime and you get a bunch of, order interest coming in and you have only so much, delivery capacity during that hour and that, beyond a certain amount, deliveries are going to be delayed simply because you're waiting for a free drone to go and make that flight. How do you prevent customer disappointment with the experience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And we have an advantage there over road as well, because we know if we look forward at the next 60 minutes and we calculate capacity in the next 60 minutes for any given GPS points, we know pretty accurately how many orders we can handle for the next 60 minutes. And that's the window where, it's actually between 30 and 60 minutes where a customer will say, I'm not willing to wait that long. I'll drive myself or I'll do without. So the first and foremost, there's no point adding capacity blindly if you don't know how to assess it in real time. So the way we look at it is we continually add capacity in units, as our repeat cohort of customers grows, so too does our volume, orders per hour, per day of week, and that's pretty easy to anticipate, and we just allocate extra capacity ahead of time. Overcapacity for us isn't such an issue when you look at the aircraft utilization, because we don't care so much about an aircraft sitting on the tarmac. We care about the people's cost, the people cost that would load that aircraft cargo, they're there anyway. So when we flex up and down capacity, it's more about flexing up and down the people that manage or load cargo or monitor those aircraft than the actual aircraft themselves.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the most utilization sensitive component of your operation is utilization of your human labor, not utilization of your airframes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Correct. Yeah, we don't really care about utilization of the airframes. I mean, we do, but in the end, don't forget we have mobile aircrafts. Our aircraft can load balance from one cell to the other. In other words, the aircraft can autonomously go from one location to another to serve demand in different locations. So we can dynamically allocate the fleet to. And there's other great use cases like parcel delivery, postal delivery, for example, and pharmacy delivery, even that you can take orders with a four hour window on them and just send them in underutilized slots. So we can balance our utilization through the day, particularly daytime hours. So I think as we grow, there'll be more of those what we call latent orders that have a window of delivery time that don't need instant delivery that we will use our fleets to fly. So I'm not too concerned about the aircraft itself. It's the people and we have two modes of operation. We have one where we're highly centralized, all the aircraft and a handful of people. And also, for example, one of our people can load between 20 and 30 flights per hour. So that's our number, right? and 20 or 30 flights per hour is the best you're going to do because our turnaround time is between 30 and 60 seconds, right? Aircraft landing, aircraft taking off and that you can't beat that. No, there's no way to beat that number. But that's the cost, right? That's that person's cost for those 20 or 30 deliveries. And you want them fully utilized. So if you're over budgeted on those people, then you're going to increase your cost per delivery. So that's the way to think about it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, what's been the biggest change in the drone delivery market in the last two years since we talked?

And like I said, I always, I'm not a great mathematician, but if you scale a negative number, you get a larger negative number, no matter how hard you try. no, look, we already have$4 in and around sometimes less, sometimes more dependent time of the week and the cargo cost per delivery fully loaded. Right. That's, and we're going to, by the way, publish this data, both on LinkedIn and through our friends at McKinsey. And so you'll see it and, but you can also see a very clear path to$2 cost for delivery, like literally with our eyes closed, we won't get there at the end of this year. We won't be far off it, but even limited scaling will bring us to a$2 cost per delivery. And what we want to win at is that, going back to the Warren Buffett, right, in a commodity world and drone delivery, ultimately, at scale and over 20 years commodity, right, it's A to B safely and quickly. The winner will be the ones that have the best cost of operation. This is why Ryanair succeeded, is why Southwest did so well in the earlier days. And we learned from history of running businesses that it's not the coolest product that's going to win in this space. Nobody cares. it's about the cost. So, so what's changed, I think we've demonstrated in superb fashion that the industry is viable, economically viable, and I think that's important. And then I think regulatory wise, again, we now fly BVLOS all over Europe. We have license all over Europe. Europe has really strong, difficult, but really clear regulations. USA has moved forward at pace as well. We see pretty much everyone operating with 135s, we see Google really starting to expand their operations, we see major brands like Walmart really leaning into it, so I would say ahead of expectations in Europe, for sure, and what we would have predicted in the USA as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What about a disappointment, Bobby?

I would love to see, and we would love to be flying under 108, very soon, but, still uncertain and uncertainty kills an industry like ours, well, it doesn't kill it, but it just makes it very difficult for companies like us to continue to grow and raise money to grow when there's uncertainty around the regulatory environment. And so 108's a discipline. Well, it's not a disappointment. It's great. We love it. It's the right shape. It feels exactly what the industry needs to scale. It's just hard to say when those, rules will be written and we'll go through the process and become, routine. So is it a disappointment? No, like I'm pretty happy that we have BVLOS in Europe. There's, 500 million people here, 300 million of which we can reach. so there's plenty of business. And I would say to any drone delivery company. get over here and start flying. Like Google are flying a mile away from my house here, where I'm recording this from, Europe is a fantastic place to build some scale. It's not as great a market the USA, it's a market where you can really get flying anyway. So, so disappointments, they're not really disappointments. They're just, it's the, I just wish it could all move a little bit more quickly in the USA. and other than that, I think we're in really strong shape.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How should we make sense of the different operating cost numbers that we see in the industry media or being talked about across the different companies that are doing this? From your vantage point, do you know if they're all being formulated the same way? Are we talking about apples to apples or apples to oranges with these numbers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think, there's some wishful thinking in some of the things that I've, seen. I would say, remembering WeWork and community adjusted EBITDA is the phrase I would think of here. You have to include packaging cost, battery motor depreciation, prop depreciation, maintenance, aircraft depreciation, personnel, all of the other costs, but those are the main ones that I listed there. If all of those aren't in your unit economics there's already a problem and particularly aircraft depreciation. So again, that goes to our aircraft has a useful life of 75, 000 deliveries. And that means that our depreciation factor is relatively low. And that's an intentional part of our product design, even battery management, battery maintenance, those ones should be equal for everybody, right, because we're all using lithium ion in some way. And we're charging them at different speeds, discharging them at different speeds, but largely speaking, while we think we're better than most on battery, I think you could pretty much assume that everyone's the same in that regard. I think where all of the players differ greatly is in longevity of the aircraft, how many cycles you're going to get from the aircraft. It's throughput per hour. And that comes to hot swap architecture or not hot swap and then charging in situ kind of the opposite of hot swap. Charging in situ means that your battery won't last as long. And after the person loading the cargo, battery is your biggest unit cost. And what I mean by that is if you're charging a battery in sub zero temperatures, or if you're charging a battery in very high temperatures, it's not going to live as long as a battery that's charged at a consistent temperature indoors. And that comes down to aircraft architecture and operational architecture. In other words, hot swap battery, the battery's only outdoors for 60 seconds before it flies. We've thought about all of that and we've thought about it because of our focus on unit costs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so you're treating batteries and motors as consumables. Those are not going 75, 000 flights. Those are being replaced periodically, but it's the remainder of the aircraft that you assert has a 75, 000 flight life. Okay, so how many flight hours, just from an aviation standpoint, comparing the expected life of this aircraft in terms of flight hours? How many is that? Roughly 15, 000 flight hours?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's a divide by eight, divide by eight. We do eight flights an\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">hour So what is the remainder of that airframe? What data do you have that, gives you confidence that this is a 75, 000 flight item? And what's your approach to continued airworthiness and maintenance of that object over that time?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Data. So our old aircraft, we call it the 3.8, was a 20, 000 flights aircraft. And we've never written one off before that, but we have many of them that have done more than that. We've a couple of aircraft over 20, 000, 25, 000 flights each. So we have formed there. We know what are the things to engineer for. When you talk about our newer aircraft, which we call 3.8.4 really it's functionally no different than our old aircraft, except for the propulsion system, which is a, it's a much easier maintenance system because most of the failures in our previous aircraft came down to wear and tear during maintenance, during routine changes of parts of the subsystem, props or, motors. So our new aircraft airframe, a single piece of carbon fiber, no moving parts. And that is easy to cycle, right? It's very easy to cycle that airframe through actually half a million flight cycles, on simulator on test benches, should I say, and get the data. And that's the process for evaluating what the lifetime of each component is. You're right, our motors and our batteries and props actually, for that matter, are in our unit cost. So we write off motors after 2000 hours. We write off batteries, in a number of flights, a number of cycles. So it's very predictable. And props less predictable although there's expected lifetime for props, it's mostly, preemptive, I would say monitoring for imperfections or damage to props and changing, but it's stack ranked it's battery, motor, props. And then we apply just a consistent percentage overhead to the entire bill of materials on the aircraft outside of that annual cost, which is quite conservative to get the look, this cable failed or that, that LIDAR unit failed or whatever, because components fail individually and in very unpredictable ways. And so I think the right approach there is just apply a consistent proportion of the overall bill of materials in an annual tax almost in form of maintenance and component switching. And we're, we've been in this five years, we think we have very good data on that. So we're, and as I said, we're quite conservative on it, but it's still overall the depreciation of the entire system for per flight is quite low. It's certainly lower than the person loading the cargo. And then continued airworthiness or maintenance and, the traditional aviation part of things, I would say our old aircraft or existing aircraft depending on what you're day you're operating on, is an aircraft that required a lot of overhead, a lot of maintenance inspections, frequent inspections, frequent overhauls. And we moved now to our new aircraft that just self diagnoses everything, designed for high throughput, long time without even an inspection. But it still backs down to very traditional aviation practices for keeping aircraft in the air and ensuring that they're safe. We, I don't think we're any different there than company that flies small planes or helicopters in the processes, the training, all that stuff that happens.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Given that you'll be publishing some numbers soon, are you comfortable sharing with our audience some high level,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Of course I\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">major cost drivers and the specific\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I actually, I predicted you would ask me, so I actually got a breakdown. Yeah. Yeah. Are you ready? Well, why wouldn't I talk about this? Because we, we do the best, right? So, so today,$4.27 cost per delivery of which fixed overhead, 71 cents, labor$1.93 consumables and depreciation,$1.63. That's where we are today. And then by the end of this year, well, look, I don't want to promise too much, but that'll probably be closer to$3 than even$3.50. Yeah. And then if I look at the human costs, so, and this comes to our operation, which again will evolve. We have different roles. So we have what we call a dispatcher, which is what others would call a pilot, that's a person that for us can monitor up to 20 aircraft simultaneously. What role they have? I don't know, because there's no sticks. There's no control of our aircraft, but they're there anyway, monitoring, but our loaders is our biggest cost. So, so that those are people that just take cargo from a vendor, load on the aircraft, just over a dollar per delivery. That's interesting because Ireland, in fact, Europe is a high wage environment, and so our hourly cost for labor is about$18. so if you look at that and then you look at our future system, which does not need those loaders, so when I talk about going from$3 to$2, that loader for us goes away and the vendor loads the cargo. So we're not in a rush to do that. We have the system built, we're happy. But for now we want to operate just highly centralized, very well managed, location. So we have that loader cost. And the number of the$1.63 that I mentioned earlier on in consumables, I can tell you stack ranked in there it's battery is roughly 50 percent of that currently that'll come down a bit with new battery chemistry we have, and then motors is second at about 25% and then maintenance, just a fixed cost of maintenance per flight that we apply and props and replacement components is the remainder of it. And there are some benefits to scale purchasing of these were obviously tiny now in terms of scale of purchasing. So that$1.63 we predict at scale will come down to about 45 cents. And so when we get from$4.27, where we are now, down to$3 or say$2 and 2 cents is the number I'm looking at, the bulk of that comes from reducing our consumables cost by just scale and better purchasing power. And then there's a pretty significant, unlock for us in change of battery chemistry, so going to a more conservative battery chemistry, but one that has a higher number of cycles and that comes from, again, this, we see this as a major advantage that our system has is that we don't need to charge our batteries and anything over 1C. So we can charge them slowly because the aircraft isn't waiting for a charge with us, so we might have seven, eight, nine battery systems, cargo systems per aircraft, and one of them is flying while eight of them are charging, so we can charge them very slowly and therefore get many more cycles out of the battery. And that, that counts in this space. It really does count. The top level architecture we have, we think it is designed for throughput, of course, productivity of real estate space, but also it flows through that because we have this hotswap battery, our costs per delivery are quite a bit lower than I think for people that are charging in situ, but look, those are the numbers. And we're actually going to publish the whole thing in detail for everyone to look at, but there should be no surprises in there. And I think largely our lower cost is driven by our higher throughput per hour.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Are these contribution costs, Bobby, or what costs are not included?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So those are pretty much everything. Those are fixed overheads that we apply, like things like rent and electricity and things like that diluted over the volume of deliveries. And the labor, as I said, and that's, that varies depending on the volume and then the consumables. It's everything. And the depreciation on the aircraft is in there as well. That's a 75K aircraft. So the depreciation is quite small in\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And you mean rent and electricity for the ground infrastructure at that launch site?

And that's a very greatly dependent on where we are, but we've applied a cost of 71 cents per delivery for those fixed overheads\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And what does that$4.27 what kind of utilization is implied in these numbers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Great question. 55 percent over the week.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay.

So don't forget our cost gets diluted by the number of drones, right? And then that's proportional to the utilization of that same number of drones. So if we've resourced it correctly, in terms of the human loaders, then you need a 55 percent utilization of that capacity to reach those numbers. Those are numbers that we deliver today based on our existing volume.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What does that translate in terms of, daily deliveries per aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we do all of that with less than 300 deliveries a day for our four aircraft.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But there are delivery surges, in the morning, at lunchtime, different parts of the day, and then there are low periods. Is that right? And so if that's the current demand pattern, 55 percent is your threshold for these cost numbers, what is a reasonable expectation for the high end of utilization that you can achieve,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">have demand surges during the day and slack period?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, exactly. So volume is what takes care of that, Peter. So you, you reduce. Or should I say you increase the granularity of utilization as volume grows, right? So we already see weekends, for example, we operate 12 hours a day. Weekends are, I wouldn't say I haven't looked last week, but they're north of 90 percent utilization now on weekends. And what we probably should do is add more aircraft and drive more demand, but we are not motivated by volume. We've never been motivated by volume for this stage of the business. We've been always motivated by those KPIs around cost per delivery and optimizing for that. So we're about to open two other bases in the same suburb. So we'll be bringing it up to the gigantic number of 12 aircraft, which doesn't sound like a lot to most folks, but that's a thousand deliveries a day for us, more than a thousand deliveries a day cause they're very productive aircraft. And if we're successful at getting that over time, if we fill that capacity, which we will, once we switch on certain new channels, but think probably across the week, it'll be anywhere from 400 to a thousand real deliveries a day in the suburb. you'll have always have that right, but we'll flex up and down the human resourcing part of that across those, days of the week and hours of the day. And we, we think a natural place to be is about 70 percent utilization and at 70 percent utilization, we're somewhere between 2 and 3 cost per delivery.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You already mentioned that this is all beyond visual line of sight, and that the loaders are the only people involved, so no visual observers. Can you talk about how the, mission execution is done with the supervisors and any progress on the 1:many front.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, for us BVLOS is one to many. And for us, that happened at a year ago where we went from many to one. So we had like two point, two point, whatever people per aircraft down to now, actually practically we think it's probably 20 to one because that person, that resource really doesn't have a role. There's no mission planning. There's no nothing that there's really no role for that person, but we're happy to have that person there anyway, to observe and just to be aware. And there's certain areas, like we fly in controlled airspace as well. And Europe has this thing called U-Space. And we've worked with the folks in Google and in Wing with this as well, about de confliction and then bringing that de confliction up a level to ADS B IN to avoid traditional aircraft. Today, we do all in an automated way, but we'd also use that observer to observe the airspace, the ADS B traffic. But like I said, that cost is ultimately going to disappear completely because there's no role really there. Mission planning is automated for us, so when a customer signs up with us we don't see them. We don't talk to them. There's no interaction. they drop a pin where they would like us to deliver. And then we use data to decide if that pin is a safe place or not. And they're in the system. And when the aircraft flies to them, we do check while we're there to make sure the area is clean. In other words, it's less than a 15 degree angle. It's inanimate. There's no people underneath. And all that's automated for us so that there's no observers required. The mission planning is quite interesting actually because there's a couple of things that are surprisingly innovative in that space. I would like to say rocket science, but it's not rocket science, but the flight planning to optimize for energy use, depending on prevailing wind is important. And then we stream the weather from the aircraft that are in the air. So we have very accurate, very localized and very real time weather data that informs the next flight. And so that's a really important optimization for us in both speed of delivery, but also in, in energy drawn, which allows us to have that nice wind envelope or nice wind capability. And so that's very important, but another equally important part of what we do is mitigating ground risks. So, we have an effective population density where we fly. Like it is very populated where we fly. It is very dense. It's as dense as the Bronx or Queens, for example. It is really dense. And we're flying over about 450 houses with every single flight. So we take ground mitigation very seriously. And we do a lot of work there. And one of the feeds that we have is real time location data from users of our code, of our apps that they give us permission to have, and we'll monitor the space for hotspots of people. And that's a really important addition to what we've done. And so that data tells us, like, for example, if there's a beer garden, there's 500 people drinking beer outdoors in the middle of the summer. And we'll know they're there and we'll automate the flight plan around that. And so that for us has proven to be quite an easy thing to build where data didn't exist before. You couldn't really get that insight into where people were before. And in an anonymous way use it to mitigate your flights. So the flight planning is quite interesting in our world. And then the other part is aside from risk, just pure ground risk mitigation. You always think about, you don't want to be flying over the same places all the time. You want to avoid channels down certain areas to overbother people. So we ran, I wouldn't say randomized, but we, in the flight planning, we do a lot of work to reduce the effect of overflights. And that's been a key part of the acceptance aspect of what we're doing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What third party software are you using, Bobby, in that process?

I suppose our strength as a team has been in software, our businesses before have all been software businesses and either way, I think, if there was available software to buy in that space, we'd probably have bought it if it met our needs. But you have to balance always with software. The difference between software that's 95 percent what you need and 100 percent what you need is probably five years. I'm a programmer myself. That's my trade. It's often better just to build a simple system that exactly meets your needs, then adopt a complex system that more or less meets your needs. And in our case, like it is not rocket science where we're building, we're not going to be famous for how awesome our software or our hardware is. That's not what we're going to be famous for. We're going to be famous for our lowest unit cost and our ability to scale that, I think. But to answer your question, we use zero third party software.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm curious, I have to ask, have AI coding assistant technologies made an impact on your organization's ability to write this software?

I wouldn't call it strategic. I would call it an optimization. We're faster writing code. We're better at testing code. It just reduces the time to write code, but once code is written, the AI is no use to you and, we have a mature platform now, so we're more I'd say tinkering, we're optimizing doing small additions and it's very difficult to let an AI into existing code and start adding things. It's more when you write it from the start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Does it tilt the equation between building your own software versus buying software?

You might, get individuals just up a level. Like some of the code I would have written recently, and I use ChatGPT or Copilot, to write some of my own code. I'm writing code now that takes two or three days. That might've taken me a couple of weeks to write before. Mostly now when you're writing code, you're using frameworks or APIs that already exist to take a lot of learning, to take a lot of time to get to use, particularly in the AI and the vision space, and that's just like, I wrote some code recently myself that, that used our security cameras to look for people walking close to an aircraft or onto one of our landing pads. That code took me less than two days to get into production. And that's something that would have taken me a month to write before. And I'm, programming 35 years. So, so think about it that way. And I think that's the only right way to think about it. Just, it just makes existing good programmers faster and better. It doesn't replace the programmer. And so your decision, whether to buy versus build would more be about if somebody has matured a platform already that has done a scale drone delivery operation, it automatically by that fact will have evolved into the right piece of software for us, and I would buy that all day long, but nobody has written a piece of software that runs a drone delivery business at scale yet, except us. And I would say Wing. And so would I buy wing software? Yes. I would buy Wing's software, but I wouldn't buy anyone else's because the software evolves in line with the way you use it and you have to use it in order to develop it, I think.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You mentioned earlier that the consumer pays upwards of maybe 60 percent of the value of the meal with traditional, terrestrial food delivery. How does the drone economics impact, the wallets of the customers and the restaurants?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that, that number comes from actually a McKinsey work in the USA where they measured and it's, yeah, it's a 55 to 60 percent increase. So you buy a pizza for$30, you're paying$45 or a little bit more. In our case, we, I mean, you can get our app, we're charging customers$5 a delivery. And we haven't seen it. That's a little bit more expensive than they might pay for that direct. Here's my delivery fee number on the ticket. but we don't mark up the menu. We don't add surcharges. There's no tip obviously for the drone. So to the customer, actually, we're probably on a par with existing road based delivery, the way they might see it. Now it's only in the USA that everyone pays this gigantic premium on basket. In Europe they're paying about$7 fully loaded, but with tip and all that stuff. And so we're kind of in a par and I think a better question is, do we think there's room to charge more? Or do we need to charge less? and I think that's comes down to elasticity of demand. The drone does, favors there. It's really elasticity of demand on consumption, right? Whether they want the hamburger, whether they're willing to get it delivered or go outside. And if we're much more expensive than road based delivery, that's where the elasticity comes in. They're just going to go back to road based delivery. So I think our industry always needs to be on a par at worst with the existing mode or otherwise better. And then that translates again, back to our unit cost story. We think there's a world where a subscription is a real thing in drone delivery. And that's where we'd like to be. We'd ultimately like every household in the world uses us like Amazon Prime or like Spotify or just part of their monthly, thing in the household. And we think we can get marginal costs down to the point where that will work. And just like Prime or just like Spotify this is an almost inconsequential monthly cost for a household and we can use that to subsidize deliveries and still make our money by charging our partners a commission on basket value. So, we see enormous upside in the take rate or the revenue per delivery without needing to increase the cost to the consumer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How do you expect unit cost numbers that you shared with us to change in the U.

In Europe, that means implementation of U-Space. The regulations are there, U-Space is there. It's just rolling it out, but there's already four or five countries in Europe that will have U-Space this year. And USA, I think that Part 108 is the answer for scale. I don't think 135 is, although there can be the initial growth and scaling in the USA, which I think we'll all do a little bit of, but true, unlimited, unconstrained scaling, I think needs 108. So that's the bits that are out of our control. I think everything else is just execution. It's a capital intensive world, so you need a lot of capital to scale this, even though it's got a good return on it. Like our capital returns in 14 months when we open a new location, it's funded itself after 14 months. But you still, as we're growing a lot, you're going to need, a lot of capital to fund that growth. And I think debt will be a big part of that finance of the aircraft, just like in aviation. So will that be a constraint? Probably not. So then you move on to, again, the things that are in our control, but will quickly get out of our control. If we don't act properly and responsibly as an industry and as individual operators, we'll be punished by regulation. Cities will slow us down like they did the scooter industry. If there's accidents or, anything really that worries people, that will slow us down. So there's a risk there that with the rise of good regulation and the issuing of licenses that people might try to go too fast when they're not ready. They're rushing to get an aircraft to market. They start flying it and they ruin the party for everyone else. If anything slows us down in a material way, that will be it. And will it happen? I doubt it because I think the regulator on both sides of the pond have been very thoughtful about this. And I don't think anyone will be allowed to fly at scale unless they're safe. I just don't see a world where, you're going to have, people allowed to take risk. We obviously are not going to, but I don't think it's a world where you're going to have small operators that raise a seed round and start flying around communities. I don't think that's going to happen at all. I see this being an industry of two or three big players worldwide that will operate properly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby in three years, are you a$15 million,$50 or a$500 million revenue company?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In three years,$100 million plus, I would hope to think, and that could very well be all in Europe as well with some of the contracts we've signed and with the state of the market here, there's every possibility that we could get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And at a hundred million, you're a top three player you're saying in the world?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In drone delivery, we want to be the number one.

So, possible we'll get there a little bit quicker in terms of scaling, just because the license regime here supports that, but, I'd be happy to share a couple of hundred billion dollar revenue industry with a couple of players as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:13:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I was just gonna say, in Europe, if you're a hundred million dollar company in Europe, you're still a tiny\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:13:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">me give you, let me give you a fun example, actually, that I'm surprised I haven't remembered this already. Without giving too much away, there's north of a million dollars out of one small base for us in annual revenue. And there's 10, 000 similar suburbs in Europe alone. If we just got to a thousand of them, that's a billion dollars revenue business and with a contribution that pays for itself in 14 months. So you pick, you just won't find an industry with those numbers anywhere that exists today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Then what stops you from being bigger than a hundred million in three years?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">it's not software, right? So it isn't, obviously the marginal cost of a unit is there always. We have to manufacture, we have to deploy the boots on the ground. It's a difficult business to scale. I compare us to a Starbucks rollout back to the Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz was on the podcast recently and he broke the numbers down and he said, look, it's half a million for us to generate a million dollars in revenue. It takes two years to pay back. And so he's all about debt financing and trying to go fast, but just it's slow. And I think we won't be as badly affected by that, but that's naturally difficult part of scaling our business. It'll take a while to get to a billion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already touched on this in the conversation about availability, there's, two potential paths that somebody in this industry might take in terms of how deep in a given geography they want to go, whether they want to offer a full capacity service to the customer in one smaller area or expand a little bit more aggressively, but not go perhaps as deep. How do you think about that trade off?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we think about kind of Goldilocks suburb of hundred thousand people and up, potentially we could make slightly smaller ones work. So think 50, 000 people and up. And if you look at that as a filter, there's some other ones like number of restaurants within a hundred meter radius of an anchor restaurant, an anchor tenant, things like that. But if you filter it down, you come to about 10, 000 locations, as I said, in Europe alone, that, that are viable for us to deliver a minimum number of, orders. so, and then if you say, okay, from a strategy point of view, do you want a thin layer? That means then you have that incumbency, advantage in, in many markets at once or as fast as possible, or as you said, do you just own a handful of markets such that they're impenetrable and you don't share them with anyone? And we've seen that play out in food delivery, in the USA and then later on in Europe. We've seen the way it goes. Each market gets its own lead player. And then 10 years on, there's consolidation for efficiency reasons, mostly, and you end up with two or three players in the region, in the continent. And I think there's a potential where if we just stayed in the main European markets, that a smaller business will start up in Sweden and one in Spain or whatever, we'll and for us anyway, we don't want to let that happen. We want to go slightly thinner in more geography, early than going deep. And primarily because we learned from the previous two industry scooters and, food delivery, and you could argue mobility as well. So, on demand rides where if you leave a market alone, something will grow there, and then you're postponing a problem of either competition on economics or, competition on marketing and owning the customer, and I think it's better therefore it's not a black and white, but I think generally we would favor going wider and more shallow. That's a stronger position to be in.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just to make sure I understand when you say that shallower and wider, do you mean not saturating a metropolitan area with presence in every suburb, but, perhaps a few suburbs but you're not thinking that, okay, once I'm in one of those suburbs the shallowness will be a characteristic of the service that you offer such that the risk is that you disappoint customers when they go to the app and say, oh, okay, great. Thanks. I can't get the service. I'm disappointed. I'm deleting your app.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">it won't be the customers that will decide whether they're getting drone delivery or not. It'll be the aggregators and the vendors won't give them a choice because it's a lot cheaper for them to fulfill that order. So when we say shallow, in an area, it means we go to a large city we'll do all of the suburbs over 50 to a hundred thousand people, but the suburb that's only 25, 000 or less, they're not getting the service because we'd prefer to be growing to the other suburbs in Madrid and Berlin and Stockholm and so on\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right. But whatever suburb you are in, there will be full and adequate availability\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, choice you mean, yes. and capacity as well. Yes, correct. So yeah, you don't want to go into a suburb and have a inferior product to what the aggregators themselves have and the aggregators themselves will want you, us, to be able to power most of their choice, some of their choice is impossible to power. You've got these real, tiny little restaurants tucked away in corners. And there's just, you're not going to get an aircraft there, but we'd like to think the 60th or 70th percentile of volume, we'd be able to get, and that in terms of volume of, or choice translates to less than 50 percent of choice. or percentage of restaurants in the area that you'd need to care about. But don't forget it. Go back to coffee. If all we ran was a coffee delivery business, we'd be a gigantic business and that would be a lot easier to fulfill than takeaway food.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, if you, as knowledgeable as you are, your background in aviation, your success in aviation. And as you think about advanced air mobility overall, let's say we break it down to a couple of different buckets. Let's say military drones, let's say commercial drone delivery, whether it be coffee, medical or the like. Or three, let's call it eVTOL, STOL let's say those are three big segments of AAM. What excites you and let's say you were an investor and you had to invest your money. I will assume you will say commercial coffee drone delivery will be an early candidate for investment. What would be next and what would be last?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">My next, without a doubt, in fact, if I wasn't doing this now or I wanted to do something new, it'd be military, defense, look at Anduril or Look at the geopolitical landscape right now and there's a race for sure to arm countries defensively with technology and that technology without a doubt is going to come in the form of flying robots largely, and that's going to have myriad sensor tech, software. It's a software play more than a hardware one. There's obviously a fusing of them, but I find that a really interesting space. And I think, the world is going to be investing a ton of capital in there and the opportunities are enormous and I'm probably unusual in that. I think that's a good thing that industry thrives because it's actually a way to reduce war, not increase war. So that's what I would be doing and I'd be doing it from the USA. cause I think that's where most of the investment's going to happen. So yeah, that's what I would be doing. I wouldn't bet on passenger mobility for a while. I just think it's too hard. I just don't think the physics work well enough yet, and the economics are, I find them difficult to see. You know, they work and it'd be interesting for sure, but I would, I'd be investing in, and working in military defense tech before I'd be doing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As you think about aviation technology, as you think about advanced air mobility, who are the thought leaders out there that you listen to? Who are the people that we say, well, when they talk, that's somebody I give a lot of time to.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You guys,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Nice.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I listen to your pod obviously all the time. I love it. but there's a number of players that, I have huge respect for. I don't want to embarrass them all, but I think, Keller and Zipline has done a super job. I think Adam Woodworth in Wing is an amazing guy. I met him last year. What they've achieved is remarkable. And closer to home, my own team, I have Siggy Zerweckh, 25 years in General Atomics that just, oozes aviation engineering. I'm wowed by the engineers, so you can probably hear that. And thought leadership in the space for me, more important than those, engineering visionary types that I mentioned are the ones that actually understand business as well. And there I'm afraid the industry is guilty of not being real from a business sense, but I have to say, it would be for me, Google and what they've achieved and drone delivery is who I would hold up in the highest regard. And thought leaders, most of your guests, I think, if I look back, you've done a good job of choosing them and I find them really every time I'm surprised, I've never heard of this person. And then suddenly I've met, somebody that's really understands the space better than I could have imagined. So, so many choices.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">One thing I think might be interesting to explore are your thoughts on, the capital that is going to fund the scale out of drone delivery. Right now, it has been primarily funded by venture capital, but clearly there are other types of investors that are going to step in and fund the scale out and thinking about, from your vantage point, who are they, what are the things that they want to see and then what will the financing of the scale out likely look like?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. So I think for who's going to pay to scale it out and what, how does the industry, get the capital it needs to really grow at its natural ability. The numbers are gigantic, right? There's probably a couple of hundred thousand, half a million aircraft are going to be needed in the next five to 10 years, maybe more, maybe less. These are big numbers, in terms of cash needs. I do though, think that the industry lends itself well to venture. We're certainly backed by venture, and we would foresee quite a bit of our future growth. So for us, we'll grow with a blend of debt and venture because we throw off cash now, remarkable as that sounds, we generate cash in a location. So we see ourselves as being probably 60, 70 percent debt funded. So think asset financing type growth and then equity is the other part and private capital for that. So venture. There's an argument that might say, private equity could get there as well. Large private equity firms could get there too. But our ambition is to take the business public as soon as we can. That is a moving feast because public markets are, not in great shape, but by the time we get to that 50 to a hundred million run rate revenue, I think the right thing to do for a business like ours is going to be to IPO because of the profile of investor that's available there. The retail investor will be very important to us as well. The amount of capital we will need to raise to grow it, as I said, to be the leader is enormous. And so it's our ambition to float the company as quickly as we physically can. But I don't think that's in the next two years. It's probably from three years onwards, but there's, there is an outcome where we're floating this business in three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, as we wrap up, what are some of the things that you'd like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the most important thing is the audience to understand that the economics have now been proven for this space. The viability of it has been proven very clearly, that this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That's, that is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think. There has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:26:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Excellent.

Today we&apos;re joined by Dan Magy, founder and CEO of Firestorm, a California-based company developing low-cost and modular military UAS systems. Dan&apos;s entrepreneurial history includes the founding of Citadel in 2016, a counter drone company employing various technologies, including radio-frequency jamming to detect and mitigate unauthorized drone threats. \u003Cbr/>\u003Cbr/>As you can imagine, Dan&apos;s rich background sets the stage for a really insightful conversation. We kicked things off by framing the counter UAS challenge, highlighting the inadequacy of most technologies developed in the past decade in mitigating modern drone threats, particularly on the battlefield.

Great to have you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>3:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you for having me. I'm really excited to be here and talk all things drone and counter Drone over the next hour.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>3:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We usually start by asking if there's anything that very few in the industry agree with you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>3:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very few. I think, I have a very strong take on, where, counter drone is going, and I don't think that a lot of the solutions that have been funded or fielded today are going to work, I think, in, like, literally months or a year. So that's probably where the biggest disagreement in this field comes from. I think if you're asking me domestically versus globally, I think domestically people still think that, now if we're going to talk about drones, that what we've built for the last 20 years is going to work just fine. And when you actually talk to people overseas, they need a totally different type of drone because we're now fighting in environments that have massive jamming capabilities. So that's a two part answer to your question.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cool, and we'll explore both of those, but just as a bit of a teaser, what counter UAS technologies specifically do you think are, not overhyped, but given probably too much credit and likewise, what are the methods that you think really are promising?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm going to answer the second part first and say, I don't know a lot of stuff that is promising right now, because I think the world has changed so fast in the last year that we've not caught up to the reality that, most FPV drones, right? We'll call them$1,000,$2000, whatever you want to say,a lot of them are now have basically a terminal guidance chip that's put on them for 50 bucks that once you figure out what you want to hit, a yellow box comes around and you hit go and you let go of the drone, right? And so even if you're jamming it, it's going to go run into what it sees. And that's just a fundamental change that has happened. And, you know, these things move fast, so if you're talking audio or, optical, maybe you have at max six to seven hundred meters at max, and that's probably in a quiet environment. or a non busy environment. there's not a lot of those out there in the world, right? It's one thing if you're on a FOB in the middle of northern Iraq, it's another thing if you're fighting in kind of a ruined village in Ukraine. So, I think the future is going to be kinetic or it's going to be EMP based. Those open massive sets of, other problems in the counter UAS space, and we can dive more into this, but like, shooting bullets at a drone or shooting projectiles at a drone when you miss, you have to now think about collateral damage in a way you don't have to with like, RF or spoofing or hacking. I think those three areas are going to have a lot of trouble. RF, spoofing and hacking. One from an encryption standpoint, two because the Ukrainians and Russians are literally hopping between channels and signals depending on what the electromagnetic environment looks like. And then three, because one, people are actively building some really interesting non spoofing technology and I think that you're going to see a ton of SATCOMs come into this or drone over LTE, which opens an either larger can of worms, as far as like, what are we okay, either one violating from a privacy standpoint or two disrupting from just a fundamental usability of all the electronic systems we use in our life standpoint.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in a peacetime environment, certainly huge Fourth Amendment consequences Okay well how about we dive right in this Counter UAS theme For those who don't know, you founded Citadel back in the day. That was the first wave of Counter UAS technologies, and maybe to frame the conversation or actually, you know, what, how about you frame that state of the market at the time?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>what the technology was like and what enabled this, initial crop of counter UAS companies to emerge and just, tell us a story of what that journey looked like for you, of founding Citadel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the founding of Citadel came out of like a need that was shared with me from my company before that from a variety of heads of securities at sports stadiums saying we have a problem with drones. This is 2015, and that we don't have anything that can stop drones from flying in. Mind you guys, this is nine years ago, right? So this is an old problem, right? And I literally Google searched what was out there and then wrote a patent on an airplane flying back from Boston after the Patriots head of security told me that, like, they're not just at the practice field now, so they think it's other teams spying, but they're, like, coming into games, and I was like, okay, now I've heard this from enough people where this is something we should go after. I am not an RF technologist. I really didn't know what I was getting myself into. I put together a really good team and, we basically used a very cool algorithm we've built, to detect and then mitigate drones and that's what we got. When we started, it was simply just like, find the drone, find the controller and attack it. And what we didn't know at the time was that for how much of a security threat drones bring to public infrastructure, the laws were not going to change anytime soon to interfere with the drone or to jam a signal. And that, there's kind of two groups and one of them has to ask permission from the other group to use that type of technology domestically. So we by accident became a defense contractor when Naval Special Warfare found us end of 2015, early 2016, when ISIS was using DJI drones and modifying them much like the Ukrainians and the Russians are today, to legitimately own the airspace from 500 feet and below in the conflict in Northern Iraq and Syria. Like, they owned it. and they had drone factories where they were modifying them to have servo motors to drop bombs. They were using them to coordinate the vehicle based IED attacks, artillery, RPGs, like everything. They were their ISR and little bomber drones, right? They're a true multi mission,$500 system. What Naval Special Warfare told us is they tried to repurpose a bunch of the jammers that were on the trucks for the roadside based IED stuff, and it wasn't working. So they were desperate to try and find new stuff. And, I think they were, we were one of the first handful of companies that were out there. Another prominent one here in San Diego is SkySafe. They're still around. But we got that first contract. We got, VC, and they invested in us, and, we then had the time and the money to really build out the technology into what it is today. I'll say, we didn't know how to sell to the federal government, right? And so, Luka, I think I've said this to you multiple times. It was like getting punched in the face every day until you learn how to maneuver in this area. And eventually you hire the right salespeople who actually understand how to sell in this area, to one, you know, build the hype train around the product. And we had and have. Probably the best RF counter UAS system in the world. it's a SOCOM program of record. But we also didn't understand how the game works. We didn't understand you got to be going to DC. We didn't understand you got to go win the Labs, right? Like, there's just a formula for how to do this. We didn't understand that. And so I think you saw from 2015 to 2017, maybe four or 500 counter UAS companies started in that first wave. We had a customer where we provided excellent customer support. They liked what we were doing, they liked our vision, and we made some really crucial technical hires that dramatically brought down our false positive rate and then increased the ability for us to interdict a drone without bringing down other Wi Fi systems. Which allowed us to gobble up parts of that market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What was novel about your technology? Why did yours work where others didn't work in the past?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'd say, you know, and you could ask any of the founders or a lot of the team that's still there today. The company was acquired by, Blue Halo at the end of 21 right before we became Program Of Record, it's small, okay? A lot of counter US systems are really big. It has what I would say is the best user interface in the entire industry. It is so simple to use and set up that an 18 year old kid could figure it out. I mean, and maybe they're better with technology, but you could say maybe a 50 year old person who's never really touched the system. How's that? Maybe that's a better analogy, right? And then the two other things are we invested very heavily in our AI team and we had a really good data pipeline and training approach that allowed us to remove false positives, right? Build a more robust model to match a drone signal in a very noisy RF environment. And then we built some proprietary kind of amplification technology and integrated in there. One that let us rapidly move between channels to step on, the signals, and two kind of increased power from what you could just buy, if you need to make noise on a drone signal or channel, for without, like, without what's available, on market today. So does that kind of give you a good idea for why we're, it's easy use. It's correctness and identifying things. we talked about this idea at the time called the Hunter algorithm, where we built this algorithm that would be able to see a drone when it comes out of a box before anyone else did that. And to this day, it's pretty amazing. you talk to guys who are still there and they're like, yeah, new drone comes on the market. The machine already knows it's a drone, right? it's pretty cool. So I think that, that really helped. And, we kept our BD team pretty small. And that's something where we'll, when we talk about Firestorm in a minute, like it's really easy to go spend a lot of money on marketing and BD. And we kind of had to go all in on defense because we didn't think commercial was going to happen. And there's a couple of companies out there like Dedrone that have raised unimaginable amounts of money and they're going after those markets. And I don't think as we see wave two right now, unless there's like a massive attack that you're going to see a change.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If we think back to those early days of the market that you're describing right now, 2015 ish timeframe, commercially available drones were rather, the fleet variety was not obviously at the level of today. And so it was arguably easier to build RF libraries for these drones to then go and counter. And for the most part, the radio links that they relied on were based on the highly proliferated electronics coming from China, that operated in ISM bands, not really encrypted, no frequency agility. It was a, good old dumb radio quote unquote. And so those early RF detection mitigation efforts worked fairly well. But, and by the way, from what we hear in Ukraine, there's still, those kinds of early,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They're there. Yeah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>e lectronic warfare solutions that work because most of DIY FPV drones that people put together are relying on those same, non intelligent radios. But, but, but the threat is changing, the attacker is getting more sophisticated in terms of frequency agility, deception, spectral awareness. This, move counter move, dynamic is evolving to the point Electronic Warfare of the past is no longer good, especially if you're facing, as we mentioned before, low, fast, erratic moving, break line of sight type of drones. And so when you project that arc of evolution on the drone side even further, what do you think EW 2. 0 looks like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Good question. I want to add a little bit of context to that story you just told, and I think it's actually really important for like, why we're in this situation today. When we started Citadel, there were actually a lot of different kind of, we'll call them smaller providers of the DIY solutions. And I think DJI made such a good product. And then when they introduced Lightbridge, Lightbridge 2, all of the iterations that you can make when you have 200 PhDs working on this stuff, right? they really consolidated a lot of the providers in the market, both from a product standpoint and then from a like, who the suppliers are going to work at. And so, why I'm saying that is the DJI tech stack, even if you have an intelligent jammer, it moves around when it sees interference, okay? And that's what should have been warning us five years ago that what you just described, right, let's call it intelligent RF, was going to come. And now that there's a war and you have Ukrainians and Russians and Iranians building tens of thousands of drones a month, and they're disposable, the unit costs to go build, those competitive technologies are going to drop down. So what's gonna happen what we've seen and what we've been told, by both Ukrainians and, friends who've spent a lot of time on the ground there, and from our trips to Ukraine is this that. Basically, everyone's monitoring the spectrum at all times, okay? And a lot of the, wideband jammers you're starting to see are being built out there where you have to find the drone in the noise if you're looking for that control link because you can now move between, channels and frequencies with ease, right? And I think we're in the first inning of that. I think by the end of this year, we're going to see some new products that do it even better than they're doing today. But what the Ukrainians and the Russians have done is they've basically adjusted their tactics around a couple key assumptions, right? One is that there's going to be no GPS for 40 to 50 kilometers along the FLOT the front line, right? Maybe 10 kilometers on each side, 40 kilometers in the middle. You are not operating with GPS. That's your first assumption. Okay? So if you start with that, and then you start with, oh, and by the way, everyone has jammers or RF signal, detectors that are able to triangulate sitting in trees so that when you launch a drone, if you don't launch it super far back or put it in the air really quickly and move, we will be able to lock on to where you are in your region and we're going to go put a lot of artillery shells right there. So those are just the key assumptions that everyone's operating under right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>table stakes basically\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's it. Correct. And so what do you do and how have they adapted? One, you look at alternative frequencies. So maybe things like Starlink or flying over LTE. And remember, there's also not a lot of LTE here because they know this happens. So they go and blow up the towers, right? But the second thing you do is you build signal repeaters and you either put them in trees, right? Or you put them on other drones. And that is how today, a lot of the stuff, if you like go on my LinkedIn, you're watching coordinated attacks from ISR drones to FPV drones. That's happening a lot of times with, the Ukrainian drone that uses, they like to call it the Baba Yaga, Which is like the witch that, steals children. You put it in the air, it's a lot harder to triangulate it because you can one, move it around, or if it's tethered to a car, you can drive the car around and the drone will follow it, right? You also, when you're up at 1, 000 feet or 800 feet or 500 feet or whatever, you also get a better line of sight. So now, these FPV drones that usually, at the start of the war were going 1 to 5 kilometers, they're flying them 30 kilometers. So I think this whole thing starts to change and we are building a fleet of products out of the same manufacturing cell and now we're building the software to coordinate all of them where people are going to have coordinated drone swarms that do that. You're going to have ISR drones that tell smaller kamikaze drones to go attack stuff and today they're in five to ten person kill teams but in the future that'll all be automated and it's coming in the next 12 to 18 months from Firestorm. We're not the only people who are seeing how this works, and they're basically building, one or two person drone teams that can go achieve this type of success. And I think that's going to make fighting RF really difficult. You're going to need bigger, more expensive solutions. You're going to need layered defenses, right? and I would not be surprised. a lot of this is starting to be open sourced, like the Russians and the Ukrainians are using drones that they basically preload an image of what they want to go run into the drone, and then they go send it in the air and they have it go hunt. And I think that's where one, humans get really scared because robots are making decisions. Two, we as the West, there's tons of material out there saying is this the world we want to live in? Right? And so there's some philosophical discussions we need to have as a society. I think whoever starts getting to that technology first is going to have a massive upper hand in the next coming decades. It's, and it's going to happen because there's a war where it's already happening and they're getting better with every rep.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of all of the counter UAS response options that exist today from guns and drone interceptors and direct energy weapons and electronic warfare, nets, falcons, eagles, streamers, aerosols, you name it. Which have the potential for the most rapid adoption and scaling? If you were to, start another counter UAS company today, what would you focus on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I can't start an RF one cause I still have a non compete for a couple of years. But, no, I would just invest super heavily into something that does drone on drone. I would attack a very certain part of the chain. I think the game is going to be go after the motherships, whether that's the Baba Yagas that are the signal repeaters or the ISR birds that are at, a couple thousand feet doing laps for five or six hours or 10 hours trying to find targets. I would try and basically either cut off the repeaters or the eyes. And I think you can do that in a way because a human is still in the loop today, and they will be for, I think, a while, running that part of the operation. If it's a guy with an FPV drone flying this one to five kilometers, one to 10 kilometers, those people are always going to be there. But I think as you see the coordination of those things, you got to try and either attack that or even go left to launch, And that's when stuff gets super gnarly and that's where our intelligence agencies need to be playing. If they're not already.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And left of launch is easy to say, and it makes sense for, larger aircraft that have a more meaningful launch and recovery footprint. But when you're talking about drones that you can launch, from a backpack or just on the go, it's a lot more difficult, to implement in practice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let me run the scenario in my brain and I'm shooting from the hip here. Okay. So guys poke holes in this, but like we did a phenomenal job in the war in Afghanistan and then even in the ISIS fight in Syria of figuring out where these, roadside bomb factories were coming from by tracing where the money was going. And I remember distinctly when we were working with Naval Special Warfare, when they told us yeah, we found the 2 million dollar order of DJI drones that went through Turkey that were obviously then just walked across the battlefield into Syria and were dispersed into the factories. That's the type of stuff if you look at like supply chain for these things, right. You could have a hundred people swiping a credit card, but if you're going to do this on an industrial scale, you got to figure out where are, and again, this is maybe more terrorist than like state actor, but who's buying, 15, 000 batteries,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>right? This is far left of launch.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm talking way far left to the launch. If you want to go closer to left to launch, you're going to need persistent ISR and satellites. That's what you're going to have to try and figure out, right? It's like, where are their launch fields? Are there patterns? But the problem with a lot of these things too, is you can take them out of a car, put them in the air or use a catapult, right? Pack it all up in two minutes and leave. So I'm not smart enough to say, that's how you should go after that. But I would just tell you like the RF triangulation and then some of the interesting things like the Ukrainians, like they've talked about how they have these 50, 000 Samsung phones all listening for the sound of a Shahed across their border. And then once they match that sound, like that's the type of creative thinking you need, which is a lot of low cost sensors doing fusion, and crunching data, in my opinion, if we're going to start figuring out, how do you actually maybe stop some of these things from happening? We're just not there yet today. And don't, I haven't personally given it too much thought yet. Cause it's so daunting of a challenge\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dan, I just keep coming back to the question of mass, and how if you look at the countermeasures in the RF spectrum, you look at the idea of countering things left of launch, but if your opponent is throwing a lot of mass into the air, a lot of air vehicles, they're transmitting on a lot of different channels, how does that change the assumptions in this approach? Because when we're talking about drones that are at this type of price point and that can be mass produced this way, I think mass takes on a new role all its own that we haven't seen in recent decades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Completely. And it's because we didn't have to fight people who had these type of counter measures for the last 20 years. Right? So the global war on terror basically leveraged a lot of kind of legacy Cold War systems and repurposed them for a fight against an insurgency that was not a high tech insurgency. And I don't mean that like the Taliban and ISIS and Al Qaeda, they figured out ways to do a lot of really nasty stuff. But it's not like you have, 80 years of state sponsored universities like you have in Russia or, Tehran or China. Where you pump out really good engineers who are now being co opted to solve some of these problems. For me, Peter, I try and keep this really simple. I love sports and I always think that speed kills. What I mean by that is if I put so many things in front of you or move so fast that it causes you to have to make a really quick decision, the human brain and even computers can only make so many right decisions before they make a wrong decision. So if you can create that chaos and use that to your advantage or the threat of that chaos, I think that's a really good deterrent and that's what led us to found Firestorm with the idea of democratizing the sky, Build so many things at such a low cost that are modular so that you can use this platform for a variety of missions that you could literally, paint the sky black. You know what I mean? And the only way we're going to get there is with kind of three key things. One is new approaches to manufacturing. The day of the exquisitely made drone, in my opinion, are numbered. General Atomics and the Reaper is going to have a very, they own that part of the market. They're gonna keep selling birds. We're seeing the Houthis shoot them down now with 50 to 100 thousand dollar missiles. So they're gonna need to stay back and they're going to need to do just like the Ukrainians and Russians are showing us. They need to be the signal relay or the pipe back to the command center. And you're going to need to have a ton, and I mean, like hundreds of smaller, cheaper platforms extending out in front of them, right? That's where the world is going to go. And that's where it needs to go. And because the conflict in Ukraine is showing us that it's changing every couple of weeks. I think, LePlant, yesterday or two days ago, he said, we're seeing EW change every three weeks in Ukraine. And we are not built for that. You need to build systems just like the Ukrainians are building the small drones. We need to do this for the big drones. They need to be modifiable. And for us, that means at Firestorm, it means from propulsion, so a pusher prop that can stay in the air for hours, right? Or it means a jet engine where we can go scream at a hundred to 200 miles an hour and go somewhere really fast and be really torquey to an EDF where we can go like pretty silent, right? That's one part of the modularity, but also from a payload standpoint. I think it's whoever builds a lot of trucks with a really simple integration plan to it and the operating system to make everything work together is going to win because we're already seeing them do that in these disparate little manufacturing cells in Ukraine. We're not seeing that on fixed wing and that's why we've, raised a bunch of money and started to win contracts for that, but it's all about overwhelming. If you overwhelm you control. That is just, I think what's going to happen. I mean, look at the picture behind me, right? How do you shoot all those airplanes down? It's the same exact idea.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the thing we keep reminding ourselves of is that the new status quo that we're talking about here is only 12 months old, and it's not going to remain a constant, just wait two years and see what this, landscape looks like. If people identify that repeaters are a single point of failure, and those are the things to target, then guess what? They're going to be 10x repeaters in the air few months from now. It's constantly adapting. And so, we need to build not for what we see in the battlefield right now, but we need to anticipate another leap in scale coming in, months, not decades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exactly. And what you just said requires us as a country to not be arrogant or the West in general, right? We fought insurgents who had no resources. We're watching the world bifurcate into two camps, and they both have a lot of resources and a lot of intelligence. So, for us, it is payload bay, electronic hookups, a operating system and a universal flight controller for a fixed wing drone, and no arrogance on our side. We just need to make a lot of those and allow you to modify it. We have our preloads, but we need to basically not have that arrogance. And I tell our team almost on a weekly basis, we are in the first inning, if that's the analogy you want to have, or for Luka, maybe we're in the first five minutes of the soccer match, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you.

In other words, in some ways, are you giving up on the technology solution with an overwhelming dumb solution? And if that's, so one, and then number two, if there is going to be a technology change, that obviates the need for overwhelming volume, what would it be?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So some of the more interesting things we've seen out of Ukraine, let me frame it in that debate, cause I think that'll help explain why I think that could, you know, could go either way. Ukrainians are supply chain constrained. They can't put a$2000 NVIDIA chip on every drone they make. So what they've gone and done is they've found a bunch of Texas instrument chips that are$50 that give them a high level of compute that are built in Europe that they can build terminal guidance on. All right. And so you're not needing to do this on an NVIDIA. You can do this on a$50 chip, maybe have a couple of them, okay, so you have some more compute. That's the first step in one of those exquisite technologies, basically being dumbed down and put onto something that is truly disposable. And I think that what we really got to see here is, I think it's going to be a mix of both, if I'm going to be honest. Because even the Ukrainians are telling us why they like our technology is we can make a ton of stuff quickly. So you're going to have to marry the sledgehammer with the sniper rifle, or the shotgun with the sniper and whoever does that in the right way, and that's why we're saying like, Hey, we think that we have some baseline technology that works, but if there's other stuff that's out there, like we will integrate it in days, right? Because we want to be able to provide that overwhelming force with the intelligent capability. Look, you could very well have something that comes out of left field here that totally overwhelms everything we've ever seen and it's like, true neural networked swarms of intelligent drones doing things. For quadcopters, there's some really promising stuff, for fixed wing stuff it's still in development. Right. And we're partnering with a bunch of people to start making these swarms make decisions at a hundred miles an hour, as opposed to 30 or 40, but I don't think we have enough information yet, Jim, to be like, this is what's going to win one way or the other. Is it the sledgehammer or the tech? We're betting that the manufacturing is always going to be a player and so we'd prefer to basically partner with the tech. And so if, and when the killer app is built, we have a way to go field 50, 000 of them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can you paint a picture for how the human operator's role is going to change as the scale of these swarms increases? For instance, in Ukraine today what does a mission look like for a human operator? Does that person manage the drone from launch all the way through to the completion of its mission? That one air vehicle, or is there a lot of handoff going on, and as we head towards bigger and bigger swarms and more complex attacks, how does a team of operators manage a much larger number of drones? What is that going to look like in the future?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's a couple of different pieces to this question. Today, a lot of the teams, you have one person reporting to the people flying the ISR bird with like, hey, this is what I see, and we think it's over in this area. And then you have somebody with a map standing right next to the pilot of the FPV, saying like, oh look, yeah, that tree looks like it should be right there, keep moving to the right, right? Remember,'cause there's no GPS here. I think that with more exquisite kind of systems in the air, like with laser target designators or a way to hand off, terrain mapping features of what this thing saw to another drone. If you could synthesize that, then the drone could figure out where it should be going, will be coming in the next, in a while. Today, the teams really consist of people behind the front lines, controlling and flying the drones, the repeater drones in the air, the ISR drones doing the circling, and then teams that have to sneak up towards the front line to launch the FPV drones, then get out of there before they get shelled, right? So we're talking like eight to 10 person teams. There are expensive versions of that now by Western primes. Too expensive for where the world is going. I think as people develop ultra low cost, I'm talking like, let's call it, a couple million dollars for dozens and dozens of big and small drones that can work together. That's where you need to be going if you want to be competitive with what the Russians and the Chinese and the Iranians will be doing in the future. So the team of the future, we want it to be one or two people, and we want to have kind of systems that can automatically launch and recover, placed in a variety of areas. And a lot of that kind of, without giving too much away, a lot of that feedback comes directly from talking to tons of Ukrainian drone operators and tons of kill teams as they explained to us the tactics that work and how they've had to build them. Fighting with those two baselines we talked about earlier, which is no GPS, and assuming that you only have like 90 seconds, maybe, before they triangulate where you are, and they just whack you with an artillery shell. So it's how do you get the stuff from behind the jamming area, or behind the targeting area, into the area you need to find the targets, either people or vehicles, and then how do you launch the supporting vehicles in a way that doesn't harm, people who have to sneak up to launch it. And we're, we've already won a contract with the Air Force to do a bunch of that, where we're carrying other drones into combat. So now we have ISR and then smaller drones. And so that's one way in which you're starting to see that happen in Ukraine as well. And I'm glad the U S government's really leaning forward with that project here domestically too, because we think that's really important. And, you know, that's one way in which we get to that overwhelming intelligence plus sledgehammer, right? You put a lot of stuff at the edge and maybe some of the smaller things have some really good capability and you have so many of them that who cares if you lose a couple thousand, we've at least identified all the targets we need to go run into and or follow, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How mature are swarming, true swarming operations in Ukraine? And I don't necessarily mean you send more than one drone per operator, but true swarming behavior that's being implemented and how do you overall see, the trajectory of that evolution?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't see them optimizing to it, to be honest, right now. I think they have a system that works and I don't think they feel comfortable with a lot of the technologies that have been developed yet to deploy that out there. I'm just giving you guys like no bullshit when they say to us, do not give us your exquisite stuff, because if it doesn't work on the first or second try, we will literally put it in a garage and start tearing the pieces out of it we want, and we will not fly it. We will cannibalize it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's what we hear. We hear from drone operators that, people throw all kinds of, feature rich, complex, very, shiny products at them. And the feedback that we're getting is, look, I don't think that those people understand the kind of user that is going to put this in their hands. This is a sleep deprived, afraid, stressed, a hundred other things on their mind type of user who just needs very simple buttons.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>8 to 12 hour shifts, right? Every single day, for months, that's who you're dealing with. it, I, Luka, you nailed it. So, like, a couple things need to happen here at the same time across the Western version of our drone industry because I'm going to just collectively put, heh, the bifurcating world is happening, right? We need to make these things super easy to use. And so for us on our team, it's taking the lessons of Citadel for how easy it was to run a counter UAS system, right? Making it look magical on a UI/UX screen, and doing all of the complicated stuff in the background. And we're about to debut our new mission planner where it ingests real world data into a 3d environment with real physics engines and allows you to modify. What do you want to do? Do you want to do an ISR capability? Great. Set up your mission, right? You want to do a loitering strike. Great. Set up your mission. But again, this is V1 of this thing. It's probably already way too complicated than it needs to be. But for us, we see a world where you need to use existing technologies that people have been trained on and make the magic happen in the background so that they can run it on a cell phone or a tablet, something that they're already really familiar with. Right. But, Coming back to your original point, we're hearing the same thing. And I think the problem we've run into, and we have to be very delicate here, the Ukrainians need materials. They are in a life or death struggle. Where they have a problem is that they go, not all the stuff you send us works because it's over complicated and it's not built for a jamming environment, full stop. But it's hard to tell somebody who's giving you a lot of money that you don't like what they have. Now they've gotten better in the last year of saying, this is the type of stuff we want. And if you guys look at the Wall Street Journal, I'm not going to name anybody, we've been hearing this for a year of companies that have sent tens, hundreds, maybe a billion dollars of product over there that when we go over there, we see them in warehouses, full stop, right? And that's material. And all they're asking for and what they like about Firestorm, and I don't mean to just keep plugging it, but we are listening to the customer, they're like, we need a system that has propulsion, that's modular and that we can easily get into and modify. That's what they need. Cause that's what they're having to use constantly on the battlefield. Right. You modify stuff.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's the greatest limiting factor of this let's say high technology that's being sent to them? What are the biggest reasons it's not working for them? So one, you said it's a jamming environment. It doesn't seem like these people are anticipating the jamming environment. Number two, you mentioned these people are sleep deprived. They don't have the mental awareness that's needed to be able to operate these. What else is the fault of the billion dollars of technology that's being sent over, that's not working for them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How it's built. It's not built to be modified. Like literally changing a nose cone is not modular. Need to be able to get in there. You need to be able to put bigger payloads in. You need to put smaller payloads in. That stuff's really important. Change comm systems. These are hard problems. We understand this is a marathon, right? And we understand that we can't do everything. We're very, egoless over here about where we are as a business. We're a young drone manufacturer, but we listened to the end customer that says like, look, have your build outs, but have it be able to be modified. And there has been some disconnect between what the U. S. is funding and what the Ukrainians are asking for. And it's a very delicate situation because you don't want to like, do you know what I mean? Like it's hard when someone gives you a lot of money to tell them like, Hey, we don't want that. Right? But you are having people in the U. S. government, like LaPlante, come out and openly say, we gave them all these GPS guided artillery shells, none of them work. You know what I mean? And then there's a couple Wall Street Journals UAVs that are not working.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dan, what are you hearing from end users in the battlefield, as it relates to existing, call it workflow, call it kill chain, but what parts of that workflow are still manual, difficult, time consuming? On the one hand, what we hear is that for instance, the target detection or the ISR bird that's looking out for targets of opportunity that on the one hand, it feels like that is something that could be somewhat easily automated, but when you actually talk to the people who are on the battlefield, you realize that this is still a very manual, far from being automated, part of that workflow. What other things are you hearing that people are having most problems with?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, look, What I think you're going to see in the next two years, and I'm just going to say like where I think it's going and it will show where I think a lot of these pieces will be automated. You're seeing like ground robots in cars, right? A lot of money. A lot of talent has gone and worked in that space over the last, what, decade, probably, as we've started to use computer vision to solve real problems. And guys, I have a four year old Tesla. There's two parts of my drive where it still can't determine something and it freaks out a little bit. So we're not there on that stuff, but there's hundreds of millions or billions of hours now of video where these models can go and learn, right? We don't have that yet for UAVs. The Ukrainians are building that. They have tons and tons of footage, but I think that's going to help with automatic target recognition and then terminal guidance, honestly. And you're starting to see some of that stuff pop up on GitHub. Which means I think a lot of that stuff will be commoditized over the next couple of years as you build the right kind of data training pipelines on that stuff. And I think that there's opportunities for Western governments to work together to collaboratively build some of these models and then to figure out how to run them at the edge with very low power. Do you know what I mean? so that's one area. So let's call that the kind of target, recognition. I think the second area, which has been just fascinating to me is you talk to some of the guys who run deep strike okay. So we're talking like hundreds and hundreds of miles or, a thousand kilometers. Right. And, They will literally have someone flying with a map next to them, right?

It's, I'll be honest, like when you ask the guys, what are you guys using for non GPS denied navigation? And they're like, well, not a lot. And you ask them why? And they're like, well, cause it's, again, maybe we're in the third inning of the ball game, not in the first inning, but it's coming along, but then there's some also really interesting non visual, INS stuff that's out there. We've seen, we're integrating one of them right now that we're pretty excited about, that we are being told by end users is very successful out there, and it does not use GPS, which is interesting. But I think you're going to see multiple little bites to be taken out of like where you need a human to solve a problem, right? And I think it's going to be a lot of little steps every week, will result in like a year from now, we'll be like, May 1st of 25, we're going to be like, Oh my goodness, can you believe we had 10 person drone kill teams? And we had, a guy looking at a map on his phone or tablet trying to figure out where he was. And we had, a drone not being able to coordinate with another drone, what to go run into. Do you know what I mean? Something like that. I think some of that stuff's coming. They don't actively talk about the need for a swarm, which is very interesting because the swarm dominates our conversation here. We talk about drone swarms all the time, both from a national security perspective and what we need to build. They're just like, well, there's a lot of targets and there's a lot of data we have to crunch. Let's just be smart and get stuff out there and then solve the problem. Because the humans still make better decisions because they've been trained at this point, right? So, I, and I don't think that goes away anytime soon, but in the next couple of years, maybe you have something where you're simplifying the decision making process for, is this a friend or a foe or a threat?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned two assumptions that people are taking as table stakes: no GPS, and then, jammers and direction finders everywhere. What other assumptions both the users and people who are providing technologies to those users should anticipate in the future of drone warfare, and especially from the perspective of a founder, right, or an investor where you want to, build products that have relevance in the years to follow and in an environment that changes so rapidly, what additional assumptions do you think that are safe to make? Arguably you're talking mass and modularity and production. what else? And what are the trade offs?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think you should be trying to build everything to be future proof, right? And the problem is that when you go, what I mean by that, of course, is leading into modularity and like the ability to rapidly change\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you say everything? Sorry. Is that like vertically integrated end to end, or do you have something else in mind?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Yeah. More, more along the lines of that type of vertical integration, right? We have six or seven propulsion systems we use, and that's because I just have concerns about supply chain for everything. I do think some things like sensors and cameras and radios, I think over the next couple of years, I have less concern about that kind of being decoupled. I think there's enough demand now, from China. Right. But what I would say is this is where the problem is because the U.S. DoD is not built to buy modular stuff. It just is not, it's used to buying a SKU. And so if you're going to look at the war in Ukraine, we need to really think about how do we align the incentives for the procurer and then the entrepreneur to solve that problem. And it's really tough. And so for us it means buying a lot of time and raising a lot of money and selling the stuff to a variety of folks to buy that time, because I do believe it will catch up because there's no other way we're going to fight the conflicts of the future. Right, because of the jamming and the GPS, that's just like the start of the table stakes, but the issues I think founders are going to face is if you're building really cool software or one piece of the puzzle, if you do not have a platform to put it on, it is very hard to find customers. And I think that, again, everything, including drones, is going to be commoditized over the next four to five years. So you have to have a business model where you can build lots of stuff, put it on things to basically get it into the fight, and, and still be able to make money. Right.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. and that's critical and sorry to interrupt, but, you're raising a really important point because traditionally, people associate big moats, with some single piece of really interesting proprietary technology. But if you're moving towards a world where a lot of the products that work are actually very simple, very affordable things that you need to be able to produce at volume. If you're trending towards this model, which, broadly is commoditized hardware, then innovating on the business model, on some of the other dimensions really becomes the key source of, defensibility for founders, which is a different way of thinking about ensuring this defensibility of the business.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Totally. And I think that means then as founders, you have to look at markets outside of the U.S. as well. We're addicted to buying big, expensive things. The Marine Corps just bought 450 million of product that you can go read the Wall Street Journal to see how it's performing in Ukraine. That was a week ago. I mean, we're, again, we're addicted to doing this. In the world I see it, and why we brought Lockheed Martin on as an investor early, the big guys know how the game works. And defense is exclusionary by nature. The world, if we're going to be successful, is small companies working with big companies to effect change within the Department of Defense. And the same thing needs to happen with our allies around the world, These big defense companies exist because they've been a very secure way to build big cold war types of systems. And so the systems have been built to protect them and keep them in business so that if conflict breaks out, you have the ability to scale exquisite systems. The world is just changing, right? Again, you can go watch my LinkedIn. I do this a couple times a week where I show a thousand dollar system blowing up a multi million dollar system. We're talking millions of dollars of ROI on small drones knocking out armored vehicles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You've made comments on Replicator recently. So what should change as it relates to Replicator based on what you're talking about right now?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We, look, I commend Doug Beck and the DIU team for getting in front of this. I think the key thing is going to be, and I think what all of industry and Congress is asking for is to take risks so that we keep doing things the way we have done them. And what I mean by that is how do we build more of stuff faster? That's the key. The delivery delays are just too long for a lot of the big more exquisite systems. And you're looking at Ukraine with 10, 000 people making 10, 000 plus drones a month. And I'm not saying that everything needs to be FPV, but that should be helping you dictate where you go with this side with this and the problem we're going to run into, it's like, so say DIU funds, the start, who's going to fund it after that? Right? That's the big problem we're going to see, I think, on some of this stuff. I'm not worried about where does the first tranche of cash come from? I'm worried about where does it go longer term? Because again, to become a program of record you need money. You need palm cycle there's all of these things that kind of prevent that from happening. And, I want to make sure we're taking risks now, cause in the scheme of things, a billion dollars that they have to spend is nothing for the DoD, right? This is where you should be really risky in my opinion. But it can be really hard for people to, not push the easy button and just buy more of all the people they know\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We talked about some of the technologies that are on the horizon, namely, automating certain aspects of the kill chain and the swarming behaviors. But is there something that you are particularly excited about, that you're seeing on the horizon or something that you would point our entrepreneurial audience to go and innovate in and solve.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the more we can bring in human and machine teaming to the decision making in the build up, to running a mission, the better. You know what I mean? I'll just leave it broad like that, but a lot of data goes into like, where do we spend our resources and where do we put things in the air? There's a lot of interesting technologies now you can fuse from satellite images, to weather data, to terrain, to news that's happening, like all of that stuff is out there. And if you can synthesize it to help you make better decisions for where you should fly your systems, I think that's going to be, play a huge role over the next 10 years, right? Like go run 50,000, 100,000 it's like the General Mattis, right? I want my soldiers to run, 50 bloodless battles before they go into combat. Well, 50 sounds light. Let's go run 50, 000 scenarios before we go in and do something. I think that's where this is going to get really interesting because that data can then feed what type of platform you put in the air and what type of payload you put on the platform. Some of the more interesting startups I've seen that have thought about this in a variety of ways have gone after kind of the data problems that those things will require. That's a really unique way to tackle something that both the primes, small businesses, and the government would probably all pay a license for\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dan, what about use cases on the commercial side of things? You've been in this industry for a while. what are your thoughts on the major demand and supply forces at play here?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm bullish on components and basically the decoupling of the supply chain. It's a little bit of chicken and egg. Everyone's like, well, do you ban DJIs? Does that then kill the whole drone industry? Does that jumpstart the domestic stuff? We're seeing NDAA compliant pieces and products go to Mexico. There's a robust supply chain being built in Vietnam. Okay. Cause don't forget guys, before the Vietnam war, the Chinese are their enemy, their generational enemy. Right. And they did fight a war after the Vietnam war with them. And they have really good manufacturing technologies there. I think that, as more of the beyond visual line of sight stuff kind of gets ironed out here, you're starting to see people over the last couple of years, starting to get waivers. I think the future is autonomous. I think you're going to see more and more human and machine teaming. And a good thesis has always been like, what can you do, or what can you put on a drone so that you don't have to fly a And we see a lot of helicopters flying over power lines where I live in Southern California, looking at stuff. I think that's a good use case for drones. You're seeing a bunch of these drone first responders software companies come out where they're like, hey, we'll build a whole management solution. But again, I think for a lot of the different stuff, it's going to be, you have to commoditize the prices of it. And that's where this thing gets really tricky because to force a change you got to have something either one, be very expensive to force someone to change their behavior. Or two, you have to offer an overwhelming product. And I think that some of the stuff's really good. Like you're seeing a lot of drones being used in ag because, there's less people working in ag. So that's a natural kind of replacement, if you will, of humans. I still think we're probably five or 10 years away from like mass adoption for these systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I want to ask you about the supply chain. We have talked in the past about that and you mentioned that you're less concerned today than you were, say, a year or two years ago in terms of the ability to source some of these critical components. Any additional light that you can shine on the state of the supply chain and how disadvantaged is the Western supply chain still to the consumer electronics supply chain coming out of China?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. It's very disadvantaged. If you guys have ever been to Southern China. If you want to build a product, they have their almost internal Amazon, you can say, hey, I need 10 of these motors and they'll show up that afternoon. It's incredible. And you can start testing them. And a lot of that is just Southern China was the factory of the world for the last 20 years. So it's going to take some time, but look, NDAA compliance, a desire to move away from just the reliance on China for everything is happening not just here, but around the world and I will just say, like, at Exponential last week, I was really impressed by how many products are saying we're either moving out or we're already out of China. It's fascinating. So, I think it's just a trend that continues and maybe that makes some of the subsystems more expensive in the short term, but in the long term, I think, look, as things move out of China, everything's going to get more expensive. That's, let's just be honest, but I think you're seeing a lot of the kind of manufacturing supply chain be rewritten. Living in San Diego, you guys would not believe how much construction is happening right at the border or right over the border. It's millions of square feet of manufacturing is going on there as companies near shore. So, I think that's a trend that just continues.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any parting thoughts for the audience or advice for entrepreneurs or, otherwise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Dan:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's an interesting time in the world.

That's just, a general thought. And then for the entrepreneurs, in my opinion, it's always been like find a hole and then jump in with two feet to try and fill it.

The first question we ask ourselves when we're trying to go do something new, whether that's a new location, new airspace, new environment, new weather envelope, new aircraft, all these different things. The first thing we ask ourselves is, what is the level of safety that we need to achieve for these operations and how do we have the confidence that we have achieved that? And early on in the program, we'll say, what do we need to do in order to look back and what does success look like in the testing or analysis that we're going to conduct? Then the next question is, what's the regulatory pathway, what do we need to show compliance with? What are the regulator expectations? And so I think that's something that isn't fully unique to Zipline, but I think is a little bit unique where a number of aviation companies start off with a compliance mindset and Zipline was founded on more first principles than that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Eric Watson from Zipline. Hey, listen, you can't help, but be impressed with the inspiring and important work that Zipline has done with their partners in Africa. With medical and healthcare outcomes that are remarkable. So you'll really enjoy hearing about Zipline and their first platform in Africa. Eric gives an excellent overview. We then transitioned to their work in the United States with our platform two. We discuss how their experiences in Africa helped and contributed to their U.S. performance. We discuss what's similar and what's completely different between the two markets. Listen, Eric is a pro at discussing the U.S. certification process. He takes it from ground up. As if we were starting from scratch, what's required, what has changed throughout the years what's working well and what can be improved and and how the certification process is different than what they first anticipated upon launching the United States. He also discusses where there's been tremendous progress in the last year. I really liked Eric's response to Peter's question of where Zipline sees the operational boundary line between missions they would fly with platform one with their airdrop method versus missions Zipline would fly with the hovering capability of platform two and that type of delivery method. Great response. Listen in advanced air mobility there's always this struggle with product market fit. Many of the players in the market had been accused of having a technical capability and are in search for a market or a problem to solve. It is entirely refreshing to hear that Zipline started with a massive problem to solve in Africa. And from that impressive work have demonstrated success in medical outcomes in Africa are really just amazing What it really comes down to is how that success translates into a bigger, yet more complex and more competitive market in the United States where their unique platform two can deliver with precision on a dinner plate with almost no noise whatsoever. Listen from Eric and how they believe they can compete in this much different market. I really enjoyed preparing for this podcast, their CEO Keller Rinaudo Cliffton is very impressive. And Eric also has a passion and eloquence in telling what they've done and where they're going as a company. But I also like about Eric and perhaps it's just a part of the culture of Zipline is that he positively talked about what is possible versus the hurdles that he faces for example, in certification, where oftentimes we only hear about the hurdles and the difficulties of working with regulatory bodies. Perhaps, it's just another reason why Zipline is having such success. Eric thanks for joining us and to our listeners we hope you'll enjoy our talk with Eric Watson as you innovate The Vertical Space. Eric Watson has been at Zipline since 2016, where he is currently the Head of Systems Engineering, Certification, and System Safety. Two of Eric's proudest moments at Zipline have been helping set up the first national scale drone delivery system in Rwanda and achieving the first beyond visual line of sight operations with an onboard detect and avoid system in the United States. Eric is passionate about moving the UAS and autonomous aviation industry towards safe and efficient airspace integration and including a participation in leadership roles in UAS Standards, Development efforts. Eric has a background in aerospace engineering. And before joining Zipline, he worked designing and launching small satellites and co-founded a start up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, welcome to The Vertical Space.

There's autonomous drones delivering products and dependent upon in different communities just really depends where you are in the world. so I think that's something that some people maybe don't realize or underappreciate and think that it might be some far off distant future, whereas there's other parts of the world that are, depending upon drone delivery services for healthcare, logistics, and other things that really make an impact in the community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you think is the source of this skepticism? We've heard this, as well. There's always those folks who for a variety of reasons are quite convinced that this is not going to work. Obviously we do believe that this is a huge market opportunity, but in your words, what do you see as some of the most credible criticisms and how would you respond?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, I'm not sure if it's, I'm sure there are some credible criticisms. I think most of the misconception just stems from a lack of it being tangible, right? Zipline's delivering, over 84 percent of the, health facilities in Rwanda and as an example, and we've started operations commercially in 2016. So. a number of years of experience doing this and I think for a lot of people in the world, that just feels distant, right? And there are areas in the United States that Zipline and others are, delivering to communities and providing access to different products and in a more efficient, safer, more green way. And I think that a lot of people hasn't been their backyard yet. Right. It hasn't come to them yet. And so it just feels like something that's less tangible and, and feels far off and distant. But in my opinion, being pretty close to the technology side and also having spent, years, working on unscaling this up and partnership with healthcare partners, regulators, different folks, it's really pretty obvious when you see it is my personal opinion, right? When you, if you might see either access that wasn't existent before, right? Didn't exist before and now exists. Or if you see someone order something or need something that's quite small, you need some children's Tylenol delivered quickly and a car shows up on your, in your street, throws the emergency flashers on and a person walks out and hands you a bottle of children's Tylenol that doesn't make a ton of sense compared to just being able to get something quickly and efficiently delivered with the right sized, autonomous, delivery system for the product that needs to be delivered in an efficient way. So I think once you see it and that the system's in action, I think it becomes pretty obvious, but there's just a lot of people in the world who haven't had the opportunity yet to be able to have that experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some have when you look at the operations that WING is conducting and also Manna, in Ireland and starting in the U. S. People who are experiencing drone delivery are, really excited and open and passionate about it. But there seems to be obviously those who drone delivery hasn't touched yet that remain skeptical about things like noise and, how really convenient this will be. Will this be available every time that I need it? So I'm sure we'll get into a lot of different aspects of this in the conversation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good point, Luka. Eric, I can't wait for you to tell the story of Zipline you know, how you started. The work you've done, providing access to important goods to those who have not had access, you know, it's a big part of who Zipline is. You've published, listen, meaningful outcomes in really well-respected journals with what you've accomplished in Africa. Is that what makes you different? Is that why you believe drone services are here to stay?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a great point and it's a great point, Jim. I think that this is a big, this is a big part of it. And it's very intentional, I think that anytime that you're bringing a new product, a new service to the world that didn't previously exist, I think it's important to be very cognizant of what the approach is, And Zipline focusing on some of the biggest problems initially, it was a very intentional thing for us to do. And so it makes for, it, in our experience, it has made for a community that has welcomed us in pretty much every instance with open arms. And so just to make that a little bit more tangible, I was in Rwanda and in 2016, helping to make those initial operations. And, yeah, and going out and talking with doctors, talking with lab techs and, people who ran the pharmacies at some of these health facilities. And when we started operations, I remember very vividly, first of all, just showing up at some of these remote facilities in more rural parts of Rwanda and being received like a, like some sort of rockstar, which is fun. and just being so thankful and so appreciative of the service that we were able to offer to help them complete their mission, like their life mission. and all the cases in my experience has been to provide those local communities with better medical care, And so just us doing our small part to be able to allow them to better execute on that mission has been a great partnership. And, the first piece of feedback that was just every single place that we went to early days was, when are you going to expand from 12 hours a day to 24 hours a day? When we first started, we started 12 hours a day service at, seven days a week through 365, but it was only 12 hours a day. And so that I remember, we were like any startup you're looking for product market fit. and we. we're optimistic, but you never know until you get there and so when you provide a new service to the world, to a portion of the world, and the first bit of feedback that you get is we want more of your service, is a pretty good piece of feedback, So, yeah, I think that's really positive. It's very intentional to, to start in those areas and to focus on those kind of beachhead markets that are maybe most in need or most, flexible and willing to be willing partners to go through any of the road bumps that happened in the first couple of years of a brand new service that you're bringing into the world. But I do think that's a big part of it. And I also think that, that point of enabling access to healthcare products, and then, also we're expanding beyond healthcare products in certain places That's not just the past, I think that we're super excited to expand to, we're now operating in seven countries and three different continents today and expanding on that. So that's, healthcare first and every one of those markets we're expanding into the UK with a partnership with the national healthcare system, this year. We have many of our partners in the U S that we are currently serving and also going to be launching with our healthcare partners. So this is not something that's unique to, you know, only certain parts of the world and it's not something that is Zipline's origin story, we're going away from, right. This is a core part of who we are and we're really excited to continue that mission.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, what was that discussion like around the table back in 2016 to bet the company on going so far away from home and picking Rwanda? What were the risks or the objections around the table that came up and how did you guys work through to that decision?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's a great question. So I think there's a misconception out there that we picked Rwanda. It's more that Rwanda picked us, obviously it's a partnership. It's bidirectional, but, there are a few things that were clear to us back then, and that was that we need to get the service into the real world to get customer feedback and learn quickly. We weren't going to be successful by, staying inside the building, and perfecting a system that had never really experienced customer feedback. That's not how great products are developed. So we need to get outside the building, start serving customers, and that's where we're going to learn. So that was very clear to us. It also was very clear to us that we need to solve the biggest problem first, right? And so that focused in, in healthcare in some of these areas where they didn't have, there were parts of the world that didn't have the best access to healthcare. So that, that had us looking in those areas. But then really, what we did is we ran a bit of a horse race, We were looking with different partners that met those criteria. and then Rwanda took the bet on Zipline. We were a small startup. Especially back then, and for the national healthcare system of, an awesome country like Rwanda, to bet on Zipline was, I think, a really insightful, profound and, risky thing for them to do at the time. and so that was just, it, I think Zipline's culture, we have a bit of a chip on our shoulder, if you will, to prove that this technology, has a really positive impact that it can make in the world and is a big part of the future. And that was just a really big bet placed on us on that partnership from the country of Rwanda and leadership within the country that we felt a personal responsibility to deliver on. which is a big part of us making the decision and going forward. and honestly, it also, the way you asked, the question in some ways, it makes it sound like we had a lot of choices, When you're a small startup, you have to, we didn't have the luxury of having a big, a big treasure chest full of gold, on our side. going in and proving product market fit, proving that there was community acceptance, proving that there is, a real market here was something that we needed to do in order to just to exist for another few years to give it a chance to get to the next level, So we had to be scrappy and pragmatic to go grow, Zipline and improve those things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. I know what you mean. You built a system for that mission, an airplane, with long range with the, airdrop method of delivery, which clearly worked for that mission. As you went through that design process for, what you call platform one where did you assume that that same platform could be expanded to in terms of other missions and markets?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Speaking honestly, that delivery experience, that customer experience has gone farther than we thought it would. We thought that, Hey, flying by and dropping a package in a parachute, into the kind of grass field next to the lab, for example, is this something that's going to, is this a great customer experience? We had some doubts, but it's scaled more than we expected, we're delivering, every day in, in Arkansas, for example, and in partnership with Walmart. since 2021 delivering, both, products from the pharmacy of Walmart, as well as other things from that facility, food, et cetera, to communities in outside of Bentonville, Arkansas, and our customers love it. It's like that same delivery experience has scaled into kind of suburban backyards in the United States. and again, in select communities are really quite well. So that customer experience in that platform has gone beyond what we expected when we were initially designing the system for that, for that specific use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you have a lot of experience flying with that and operations using that platform. Where do you guys now see being the operational boundary line between missions you would fly with platform one and with this airdrop method versus missions you would fly with the hovering capability and that type of delivery method?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So maybe a little bit of background here, just to catch him up who might not, might not know. So Zipline is developing, a platform two system as we call it, and and that system is focused on home delivery, as a vertical takeoff and landing electric aircraft, hovers to take off transitions to fly on the wing and then transitions back to a hover delivery site. Lowers what we call a droid. It's like a cute little robot hanging on a tether down from the aircraft that goes into the delivery area, identifies the right delivery site and leaves the package right where it's needed, whether that's your backyard table or somewhere else. so anyway, that's the, that's that next generation. Quick verbal description, pictures worth a thousand words. So feel free to look it up, but quick verbal description of the platform two system. and yeah, but great question. So we, the platform one system is really designed for long range missions, And so that is instrumental in, positively impacting, the healthcare system and, with our partners, which could be with national healthcare systems, or it could be, local, in the United States or other places, more like local networks, healthcare networks, and it's focused on more rural areas, the edge of suburban, some suburban areas, and then platform two is focused on urban and suburban, home delivery as, as well as moving products, Like lab samples between hospitals and more urban settings. and so that's the distinction is do we need long range and, and also have the ability for, dropping the package into a bit of a bigger area, or is this a shorter range, more dense area that really needs the high delivery accuracy and honestly magical delivery experience of the Platform 2 system?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Over the last year or year and a half, a lot of people in the industry, have been surprised by how much demand is and will be coming from home delivery, suburban delivery of high volume, low value goods like food, like coffee. When you look back to 2016, how did you prioritize these markets? what were your expectations in terms of, the growth opportunity for the healthcare B2B delivery versus Consumer B2C delivery.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We've been very focused on, on the healthcare space as supply and, upbringing that's core to who we are. with that said, and we think there's a real viable business model there that, that can scale. with that said, I remember, Amazon stated about 85 percent of products that they deliver are less than five pounds, So there's a clear need beyond healthcare for instant logistics and instant delivery of all the types of products and some of the ones that you just mentioned, retail, food, et cetera. And so we firmly believe that there's an opportunity for drone delivery and, Zipline being one of those providers to really make a positive change, not just inside healthcare, but be able to, make a positive impact for these other spaces as well, to deliver goods to homes, and other places, but, to homes that are in a more, in a safer, quieter, more efficient way than the current, mechanisms that are used for those deliveries.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric was your Africa experience, a net positive financial experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, there's no way that Zipline exists today without our experience in Africa. so\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But was Africa profitable. Listen, what you did in Africa with providing access to goods. You know, to people who would not otherwise have had it. In an a timely basis. Listen to clearly saved a lot of lives as, and there's a reason why you have such market penetration in Rwanda, in different parts of Africa. But was that profitable for you?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mean on per delivery basis, Jim?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes Luka. Yeah, there's a, you know, listen, there's a part of me that says, why not just do that everywhere, delivering service to more remote areas. You know, you don't have the same air traffic issues you don't have the same certification issues. Your outcomes are through the roof. And, an argument can be made, just keep doing what you do really, really well, where there's a clear use case. But if you're not making money doing it, then that would explain why you would want to get into a more crowded space.ableit potentially a large market. But a very, very different market with a very different vehicle. But was that profitable?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So we're super excited that we're able to sustainably serve the communities that we're serving in Africa and everywhere that we operate. Zipline has, I think it just comes to the aspirations of the company, we're focused on enabling an instant logistic system that serves everyone equally in healthcare and beyond. And so while we are excited about the, both the mission and the business aspects of serving, communities that may have access challenges, there's more, There's, there's more that we believe that supply can do to positively impact the world than that. And so we're focused, not only on continuing to expand and scale those operations to, expand that positive impact, but also looking at, we feel like we're uniquely positioned to be able to make a positive impact in other areas and in other markets. And so that I think is the main reason for the expansion beyond those initial use cases is that, we're super excited to, to be able to do more. And it isn't a shift away from those core use cases. but it's more of an addition adding on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, can you give us a sense of the kind of utilization that you were able to achieve in Africa and, ballpark cost figures per delivery?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>21:37\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, super excited and a huge shout out to our operations teams in a lot of these markets that really blow me and a lot of the rest of the team away every day. we designed our, platform one system we thought initially that doing, if we could only do 150 deliveries in a day, that would be amazing. That'd be a huge impact. That'll be great for the business, great for the community, and we regularly do over 400 deliveries a day from a number of these facilities without really making many design changes, without doing much, just the operations team has found opportunities for improving efficiency, integrating, smoothing demand, integrating in a really creative ways with local healthcare systems. yeah, it's been really powerful to see the demand from the local communities just continue to increase, and that not just being within, the products we started with. We started in Rwanda, for example, we started with blood products. We expanded To medical products, medicines, vaccines, and, those are basically three of the core product categories that we serve in our, almost all of our communities that we serve, but also expanding into areas that we never really imagined, or at least didn't think would come this quickly. One example of those is animal husbandry, where we're delivering. different types of, artificial insemination products and, swine, semen and other things to improve livestock health and efficiency of those systems in these communities, which has a really big positive impact on the local economics, and different things within the community and health, within the community. So there's, it's one of those situations where providing, Logistic system and focusing on an initial use case that is really impactful, but then the creativity of our partners being able to identify other ways to use this logistic system to positive impact the community has increased volume and demand in ways that we didn't really think were on the horizon when we first started.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Eric, the 400 deliveries per day, this is with how many drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oof. yeah, sorry.

If I listened to and read properly, they're the ones who were paying for the Eric?.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, we have. absolutely, yes. but in the markets that we operate in, the, either the national level or the state level, depends on the countries and how their healthcare systems are set up. those are our key partners in the from a contract and economic standpoint, I also, would have to give a big shout out to a lot of the other partners that Zipline has, across, to name a couple, Gates Foundation, Gavi, a lot of different foundations that have supported Zipline's ability to get off the ground. in, in these markets and it can continue our operation. So one of the things that we've found is it's really important for success of the integration, into the logistic system to have, really deep buy in and support from the healthcare system that we're partnering with. but also Zipline's really excited whenever we can to bring additional funding into the mix, to, to support those operations. And, there's a lot of very generous organizations around the world that are excited to make a positive impact and see that their, dollars can make a pretty big impact when deployed in partnership with technology like Zipline's.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Eric, how does the experience accumulated in Africa operations translate to your aspirations in the U. S. and specifically how the FAA looks at this experience and, gives for lack of a better word, credit, towards certification and towards operational approvals in the U S what we have heard is not just, relating to Zipline, but, you can extend this, to military operations and other internationally operated, companies that wish to come to the U S that, yes, there's definitely a nod to flight heritage, but at the same time, there's pushback in terms of the operations not really being conducted in the complexity of modern and busy airspace systems, such as the national airspace system in the U. S. and so in your conversations with the FAA, how difficult of a conversation has this been and how have you structured and conducted and analyzed operations in Africa to make sure that it will be. acceptable to the FAA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a good, it's a good one. So two different things here. First is the positive impact on Zipline, we've learned a ton across the operations that we've done to date. we've flown in total commercial operations, serving our partners 65 million miles, more than 65 million miles, which is over 2, 500 times around the globe. I did the math recently, blew my mind. and so that much flight experience brings back a lot of learnings, And so we have continued to improve our product, improve safety, improve operational efficiency, with these learnings, better understand and characterize the environment in which we're operating in, weather at low altitudes, all of these things. So that's one is just that experience, not the for credit side, if you will, but just the product improvement side is really cannot be overstated. And then the second part of the question around. how is that flight experience, leveraged or considered in, in conversations with FAA specifically, I think that there's been somewhat of a shift here over the last few years in my experience where, I think that we're at a place now that the FAA is much more, taking a much more first principled approach, and much more open to those conversations where, depends what we're talking about, If we're talking about trying to take credit for the, the aircraft's ability to fly through rain, then, rain in Ghana is the same as rain in Utah, So it's very similar. and it, it's dependent on different variables, of course, but there isn't anything fundamentally different. And so it really depends on what is the area in which we're attempting to take credit or asking to take credit. And as long as we're coming in with, rigorously evaluating how does this compare, how does this data compare to the claims that we're trying to make and the operations that we're trying to conduct, then we've seen, especially over the last year, a pretty big shift to the FAA being willing and, good partners and evaluating that, asking the right questions about how is this different and how does this compare, but then as long as we're for, as long as we're doing our job from the first principles standpoint of making sure that, this data does compare, that it is useful in demonstrating this safety claim and that we're achieving these high safety bars, then we have had success using some of that data for credit and working towards FAA approvals.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there any aspects of Platform 1 that would prevent it from flying at scale in the U. S.?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>no, there's, yeah, no, there's nothing preventing platform one from flying at scale in the U. S.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right, let's put a pin on Zipline for now. We'll come back to it, especially as we, talk about scaling operations in the U S but let's zoom out a little bit and Eric, when we talked prior to the podcast about, possible themes, you mentioned that you thought we didn't talk enough about the UAS certification paths. So let's spend some time on that. Perhaps start from the top and let's assume that we want to start a drone delivery operation in the U.S. What are the approvals? what are the certification paths for the aircraft, for the operation? Talk us through the current uh, certification path, and also contrast that to what the potential future processes might look like.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So Zipline is a part 135 certified air carrier in the U. S. The, the reason that, that we are is because currently in order to conduct beyond visual line of sight, parcel delivery for compensation, those operations cannot be conducted under part 107 and the regulatory framework for conducting those operations is part 135. we're a proud part 135 air carrier. It comes with a lot of, a high safety bar, a lot of, safety based and operational processes. And the design approval side of that operational certificate that we leverage is, Section 44807 Exemption. And this acts as the design assurance side of what is the UAS, not just the drone, but the system that we're bringing in to conduct those operations under. And this is an area that has, when it comes to part 135 and also the design approval side there's been tremendous progress made over the last year. I think 2023 was a really big year in the U S and in partnership with FAA for not just applying, but I think for the industry as a whole in streamlining the processes towards demonstrating those high safety bars. For the high safety bar for those operations. And we're really excited about the progress that we've made over the last year, as well as we think this is just going to continue, all signs are pointing towards this, just further streamlining and becoming more efficient and I think an important thing that, the FAA in my opinion is really leaning into is, defining and maintaining a high safety bar, which is, all of our goal. but I think the FAA is moving in a direction that is more flexible in the standards and approaches for an applicant to demonstrate that they're achieving that high level of safety, Which I think allows more room for enabling innovation in the space. And I think, this could be in opposition to, or counter to really prescriptive set of requirements, So this is more, I think the FAA is moving towards evaluating what is the level of safety of the proposed operations and is that achieving the safety bar, that we've defined. So there's a shift towards being more into the future. There's an expected movement towards part 108, which is a new regulatory framework that, a draft should be coming out this summer from FAA is what we're hearing and we expect to be a continuation of what we're seeing in the part 135 and 44807 exemption, processes where there'll be further streamlining the approvals that, Zipline and others have worked to achieve under the current frameworks, we'll transition over into that part 108 world. and I think expect a very similar safety bar, but further opportunities for efficiency and demonstrating that level of safety. And I think that, the main change that I expect specifically is a movement towards more statements of compliance from industry to industry standards, consensus based standards. And so that means that there's, those industry standards are really important. And that's an area where Zipline, and others that, that we work closely with are really investing in over this year and into the next year is to make sure that we're set up for success, when the part 108 comes out and things are shifting every, every day they're shifting more towards, how is this approach how is this proposal demonstrating compliance with industry based standards, And so being able to ensure that we're working collaboratively as an industry to set up performance based and first principle safety based standards that then we can demonstrate compliance to is a key part of the future of UAS approvals, in my opinion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the ways that operators obtain a 44807 exemption? Is it typically through the D&amp;R process? Can you talk a little bit about that versus what has emerged as the more streamlined way through the flight standards, office of the FAA?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so Zipline received our first 44807 exemption, through a process that was, different than the current process, I'll say it's an evolving landscape. and that initial approval is carried over into the current method, as far as being grandfathered in, if you will, into the current method. And the current method is a derivative, I would say, of the durability and reliability based approach that you're referencing, where it takes a lot of the, a lot of the components from that, a lot of those same concepts of really thinking about it at the system level, as opposed to, piece part component level, the certification, and design approval. So it's really thinking about the system and let's define the operating environment and the limitations and everything for the system. And let's go demonstrate that this overall system, this UAS can operate safely and repeatedly in that design domain, In that operational environment. And so it is a very similar approach to that durability and reliability approach. I think one of the main differences is that the more classically the durability and reliability approach was done really in partnership, step by step with, FAA and with a lot of FAA oversight, and a lot of FAA agreement on, every document and test plan and all of these things, a lot of witnessing of testing, et cetera. And the new processes are more focused on, being compliant to industry standards and having company statements of compliance to achieving those very similar requirements. but having that slightly different approach has led to an opportunity for, I think, moving change management and initial approvals much more efficiently through the process while still achieving that same high safety bar.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>35:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the interesting, moves in my opinion has been, the shift away from dealing with the design. part of the FAA and more with the operational, the flight standards folks, if that is true, if you agree and you see this as well, how are those conversations different?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that there's more of a focus in the last year. Again, there's been a transition within the FAA and how they're handling UAS operations to have more of a focus on evaluating the safety of the proposed operation. And so there can be. that can be very, location specific, there can be different types of mitigations that can be put in place for different types of risk, but it's really thinking about what is the level of safety and is this achieving our collectively high safety bar, or is it not, And I think that is, is a different lens than looking at it from a very certification and compliance perspective. framework, right, of saying what are the specific regulations and is every part of the system in compliance with those regulations, is just a different lens to look through. and yeah, we've been pleasantly surprised with the shift and it's a movement more towards actually looking at the safety of the operations, which is more directly aligned with what I think we all care about at the end of the day. And so I think it's been a really positive shift.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what's the latest in evaluating the safety of the associated elements? What was it, maybe two summers ago that the famous memo landed and the industry, was very surprised. What was your experience like in proving safety and, obtaining approvals for, things like C2 Ground Control Stations. and how is the FAA dealing with it now?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>37:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that the. I think approach to associated elements that the FAA decided to take a couple years ago, is much more aligned and works much better with the more current approach of evaluating the safety of the proposed operation. I think it was a bit of a challenge to figure out how we then, handle different associated elements, different parts of the system with respect to showing compliance, to the set of regulations on the design side. But when, with a shift more towards saying, what are the proposed operations and what's the safety of these operations, then it becomes more, it's just more flexible, I think it's just a more flexible lens to be thinking through. And so we've seen, yeah, I think a fair amount of success of having the UA, the aircraft and the associated elements, all being considered as a part of the operation. and when it makes sense to treat them the same, we treat them the same. It wouldn't make sense to treat them a little bit differently. We treat them a little bit differently, and be able to have those categories to, to think through from a first principles safety perspective, dependent on what the proposed operation is something I think is working pretty well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You talked about future Part 108 leveraging industry standards. Where are the missing pieces today? Parts of the operations or technology that the industry is yet to agree on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I think when it comes to industry standards, in my mind, there's two different categories of progress that we need to make. One of them is there are just gaps, If you try and piece together all of the standards to, to paint a full picture, to put the mural together, there are some places where there are just some gaps. So those gaps need to be filled. And then I think another opportunity for improvement is, some of the standards that do exist that are, the right standards in the right areas, in some places they're maybe overly prescriptive or refer back to older processes or older approaches to things. And so I do think there's an element of the industry needs to align on updating some of these standards to be more performance based, and more flexible to support innovation in the space. Again, with that eye towards what is the risk level or this level of safety of the proposed operation? And is that achieving the safety bar? that's what matters at the end of the day. So yeah, I'm excited to, to, partner with other folks in industry. I think that, like I mentioned earlier, Zipline's going to be investing here. I would encourage any members of the audience who are potentially interested to get involved in this space. I think there's a big opportunity to move not only, drone delivery, but other drone applications, as well as honestly setting, in a lot of places setting the framework, for autonomous aviation, in a number of places. So I think it's a big opportunity and having, especially there's room for more operators with experience, more manufacturers with experience to, to join some of these conversations to make sure we're moving these standards in the right direction for the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, across those two categories, on industry standards, can you name some that are your highest priorities, whether gaps that need to be filled or standards that need to be revised?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>40:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'll put a plug in here there's a, operational risk assessment standard within ASTM that I'm, taking an active role in helping to update. this was a standard that came out in 2016 and we're planning on updating throughout the course of 2024. So this is something that is really an opportunity to look at, like I mentioned, what is that evaluating the safety of the proposed operation in a really smart way, and the industry, I believe, is lacking on the, an agreed upon process for conducting that type of analysis. And that includes, what are some of the equations that we use, what are some of the data sources that we use. And I think that the FAA has made a big step forward in better defining where the safety bar is. one of those, one example being FAA order 8040. 6A that came out late last year, which is, I think does a, is a big improvement to the previous guidance about where the safety bar is and I think industry has a step to take in order to agree upon what are the standard approaches, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the level of safety of the operation. So this is an area where I'm actively involved. There's a number of areas, that we both need to fill in some gaps as well as make some improvements to, to some standards, especially some that are a bit old and maybe out of date.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are any of these gaps or, missing standards, a direct obstacle for the industry to grow over the next one or two years,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the good news is that we're in a transitionary period, right? And so we're still, while part 108 is being developed and putting into practice, we're, we're still operating in this part 135 and section 44807 exemption world. And. That includes a combination, It's a combination of working directly with FAA in some areas and being able to take advantage of some of the standards that do exist in other areas. And no, I don't think that there's anything that is a direct blocker to industry right now. I think it's more of We need to do the work to set ourselves up to fully take advantage of the, process improvement opportunities that are, being, being placed in front of us. So I think that I don't see anything that's a blocker today, but I do see some opportunities to further accelerate, the industry in the future while again, still holding that high safety bar. Finding more efficient ways to demonstrate that level of safety with initial systems, new operations and new environments, design changes, et cetera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you see that the challenges around Boeing are in any way impacting the FAA, either in terms of their bandwidth or their appetite to engage with the UAS industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, not me personally.

So no, I don't see anything at a day to day level, with the folks that we're working with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric as Zipline came into the United States and you saw how you wanted to monetize your operations here and you saw certification clearly as a hurdle. how was it any different than you thought it would be when you started.

And where we are today I think we're in a pretty good place. I think the industry is in a pretty good place from a, regulatory and technology and level of safety and all of these areas, compared to our expectations when we shifted some of the focus, when we added the focus of expanding into the United States, it's really in kind of 2019, 2020 type timeline. we didn't make as much progress as we hoped, so we got, I think we're at a place that we feel, we're excited about. We think that there's, we're really excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I think it took a little bit longer to get here than we expected to. but yeah, I think that we managed through and really excited about where we are. And I think the industry is in a really right place for innovation and also, scaling in the United States, and beyond over the next few years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And if you said there were two or three things that you took from your Africa experience that helped you operate in the certification world more effectively, what would they be?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think it, I think the main thing, and this is a little bit, zoomed out, but Zipline has always taken the approach of being very first principled when it comes to safety. The first question we ask ourselves when we're trying to go do something new, whether that's a new location, new airspace, new environment, new weather envelope, new aircraft, all these different things. The first thing we ask ourselves is, what is the level of safety that we need to achieve for these operations and how do we have the confidence that we have achieved that? And early on in the program, we'll say, what do we need to do in order to look back and what does success look like in the testing or analysis that we're going to conduct? The next question, once we have that plan, we've identified that level of safety, we've identified the process to get there and convince ourselves. Then the next question is, what's the regulatory pathway, what do we need to show compliance with? What are the regulator expectations? And so I think that's something that isn't fully unique to Zipline, but I think is a little bit unique where a number of aviation companies start off with a compliance mindset. And I think that Zipline was founded on more first principles than that. Starting off with first principles, safety, and then also demonstrating compliance is a key part of it. But making sure that we're setting our own objectives, our own safety bar and ensuring that our operations are achieving that. I think that's something that, is in our DNA, That started back at the beginning of the company and I'm excited to, to see that kind of progress and mature over time, certainly, but I do think it's a key part of ZipLine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric you gave us a high level overview of the P2 platform that's in development. What can you share additionally about the state of the development of that platform?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'd love to rewind the clock a little bit. I'm happy to get there, but in order to get there, I feel like showing a little bit of a origin story, I think might be important to set the stage for how we got to where we are. and so the Platform one system we've talked about a fair amount. Platform 2, we talked about being focused on home delivery in urban and suburban areas. And, this became really obvious to me as a need and the right next step for ZipLine in 2019. When, I was just reflecting recently on when this was exactly. In 2019, I was spending a lot of time in Ghana. working on expanding our operations there in the more kind of remote parts of Ghana and partnership with our, our healthcare partners, operations team, regulators, everyone involved, different airspace operators. And, there was a friend of Zipline, Joe, shout out if you're listening, who kept, he was a doctor, well connected doctor in Ghana and kept reminding me or telling me that, hey, it's great what you guys are doing in the remote parts, but we really need you in the capital city. We need you in Accra. We need you in Kumasi. We need you in these urban areas as well. and I wasn't so sure. I wasn't convinced. and. one thing that Joe did is he said, can I have a day of your time? And I said, yeah, of course. And so he took me around to some of the main hospitals in Accra and walked me into the emergency rooms and some of the places and introduced me and asked the doctors, the folks that, who ran some of those facilities, heads of the emergency room, when is the last time that you didn't have the medical products that you needed in order to, properly care for someone, and even, lost a life of someone that potentially could have been saved if he had the right products. and every one of those hospitals that, that I went to, that, that, kind of Joe brought me to, the doctor had a story within the last 24 hours of when that occurred.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What was the most common answer that they said Was it blood?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most common, yeah, most common would be, yeah, rare blood types, right? Someone in the middle of the night, rare blood type, and just couldn't get it, couldn't find a donor, couldn't find access to the blood bank, in time. yeah, that, that was the most common theme. and so that, that became pretty clear to me that, wow, right, this, we've really been focusing on some of these more remote areas, but there are challenges, not just in Ghana, then we did our homework, we did our homework, looking at other places around the world, and concluded that, hey, this is a, this is also a real challenge. That was, again, for me personally, that was when the light bulb moment happened where I was like, okay, in order for us to accomplish this mission of enabling access to healthcare to everybody in the world, we, we need another solution, right? There's a lot of people who live in urban and suburban areas and we're not serving them properly. And so that was a big movement in that direction. and then, fast forwarding through time, we're, we. Then I've, have been working over the last few years to develop our Platform 2 system. That's focused on solving this problem, Enabling home delivery and operations in urban and suburban areas, with, I think a pretty cool customer experience and delivery experience really focused on, everything you need in order to do that in safety as a top objective, quiet, really. precise and inviting and fun delivery experience. So that's what we've been focusing on. we have a really strong demand, which is amazing to see. We have lots of partners in the healthcare space and the retail space and the restaurant space, a lot of partners, and some of the main feedback that we received from those partners is just, when are you going to launch with us? When can we expand to these customers? and so that's, that's great feedback to have, demand signal from the market. So that demand's great. We've been able to make a lot of regulatory progress. as I mentioned, initial Beyond Visual Line of Sight operations and in the United States late last year, really being something that, that was a big unlock for Zipline. and that was, with our onboard detect and avoid system, being able to allow us to operate in different types of airspace with limited infrastructure on the ground, to unlock those new areas inside and outside of mode C, veil areas. So in, in areas near big airports where there's more requirements for transponding as well as, in areas that are not near big airports where, there's less cooperative airspace. we've now conducted beyond visual line of sight operations in the United States and, both different types of airspace inside and outside Mode C veil, which is huge. There's about a little bit more than half of the United States population lives inside Mode C veil areas. but that also means that a little bit less than half lives outside. and so being able to bring, access and instant delivery to everyone in the world really means we need something that can hit all these different areas. Right. And that, that demand is huge. the regulatory progress we've been able to make, which is, we, we see as a lot of these things being cross platform, it's not an approval for just this specific aircraft in this specific instance, but it's really paving the way, If we have this level of performance of a system, then we agree and we've gotten agreement from the FAA that we can safely operate in these environments. and so now we go design also the next generation aircraft to have, the same or even better level of performance, then, it'll follow that we will to get very similar approvals within the same, part 135 air carrier certificate to operate and add that new aircraft into our operations. And, and yeah, and then as far as where we are in the program, it's just, continuing to develop, bring up the supply chain, manufacturing, flight testing, all of the things that are required in order to set up and have the capacity and capability of the next generation system to be able to meet that demand signal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Eric, you mentioned your conversation with Joe and, you know, I love that story about listen, even in a city, there's a requirement for instant access for certain goods. But how much of your valuation, is a function of your ability to deliver goods to areas that otherwise wouldn't get those goods. You know, whether it be an Africa or whether it be in the United States. Or how much of it is your ability to deliver same day services to the home, for example, where you're now competing in a much more, it's much more of a red sea. Will you always get a better part of your valuation because of your ability to deliver goods that are not easily access to more remote areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's absolutely both. it's absolutely both. I think that there's some really high value use cases that Zipline has been able to serve and, really humbled by the partnerships that we have in order to make those positive impacts in the world so far, and really looking forward to expanding that. I think there's unique value that we can bring into those spaces. with that said, there's also, there are other use cases, And, I, again, it's speaking for myself here. I, pretty recent, I have two little kids at home and pretty recently. I went to the medicine cabinet in the middle of the night in search for some Tylenol to help with a fever. And sure enough, we happened to use the last of the Tylenol the last time that we needed it and had forgotten to get more. and really wished that I could get a drone delivery on my back porch in 10 minutes, in that time. so there, there's those types of use cases\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>53:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in that situation, Eric. Great example. What's your competitive advantage? You know, there are a lot of big players now who want to be able to deliver that Tylenol in the middle of the night. Uh, I love how you talk about your ability to quote unquote, you know, deliver on a dinner plate. You're so exact and what you, you can land and because of your droid. But what's your competitive advantage and being able to provide that, is there a cost advantage? I know noise is significant and it's a very quiet aircraft. I know that you can land it on a dime or, you know, on a dinner plate, but why would you be better than somebody else who was also able to deliver that Tylenol in the middle of the night?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>54:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, I think there's a number of, I think there's a number of different factors. yeah, my speaking from that experience specifically, right. It's, the way that we're developing Zipline would be a far superior experience to what I experienced that night. just being able to quickly open up an app type in what I'm looking for and have it show up in 10 minutes. It exactly where I want it. Where I, can still just be wearing my pajamas and have my slippers on in the middle of the night. Like that was not my experience, right? The experience was, I was lucky enough to be able to have product delivered, As opposed to having to get in the car and, and go find a 24 hour, pharmacy or whatever it may be. but it. It takes time, So someone's got to be awake looking for that. and then it shows up in a 3000 pound combustion engine vehicle to hand you a, an eight ounce bottle of Tylenol, at your door in the middle of the night. that's just, so some of the things that we're focused on doing are enabling faster, more efficient, more kind of user friendly experiences, as well as being able to deliver on safer, quieter, more environmentally friendly alternatives, right sized for the mission, solutions. And I think that that has a number of different. benefits over the current status quo.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:40\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Eric, do you see Platform 2 flying first in the U. S. market, or do you see it flying first in Ghana, against the use case, that you mentioned?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, we're keeping our options open, just to be transparent. we're looking at both, We're looking at both expanding, Platform 2. 0 service in some of the international markets that we currently have, quite a bit of experience in, as well as looking at, bringing the system first to the U S we have strong demand signal in, in multiple geographies and there's uncertainty, there's regulatory uncertainty, there's different types of uncertainty. And so it's just really important for us that we're able to, as fast as we can, deliver on our side of the, bargain with our partners. And so we are keeping our options open and whether or not we go to the US or international first, but I will say that there's been a lot of improvement and a lot of progress made in the US from a regulatory standpoint and also a community acceptance standpoint that we, we've had really positive success with FAA recently, as well as our operations and that we've had in North Carolina, Utah and Arkansas, serving customers and delivering products as have been really well received by the local communities. And that puts the U S on the top of the list, Like that, that, that puts it in the conversation, which is something that in 2016, it wasn't the case, right? In 2016, it really wasn't an option to come to the US first with a new system like this. So we're really excited to see the progress that has been made such that we think that it is a viable option to take a new service like this and bring it to the United States first.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see. Can you share a story with the audience, sort of talking about the design philosophy that has evolved at Zipline, on the basis of starting in 2016? and building Platform 1, taking a very verticalized approach to building it because at that point in time, that was a necessity. And now as you come to design Platform 2, can you tell a story about how that philosophy influenced the design of Platform 2 and perhaps what you guys have learned since you've unveiled it, in terms of development and and testing that's undergone since then?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, this comes back to, I think, this is just a good principle for launching new products and starting new companies is Zipline since the beginning has been focused on providing a service and solving a problem. Not developing technology as the top priority. And so when we started on this mission, we were focused on, enabling access to healthcare and providing an instant logistic system that, that serves everyone equally. And we thought, probably naively that we would be able to go out and buy some drones and buy some, it was the first thought buy some drones and start operating them to, to help, solve these problems quickly realized after buying and testing some drones that wasn't going to work. and so then we thought, okay, we'll be the system integrators. We can go buy, a number of components, avionics, flight control systems, autopilots, assemble them all together, and then we'll have our drones that we can go start solving these problems with and serving these customers. and what we've found over and over again over the years is that, it's really tough to do, It's in order to achieve the levels of safety and reliability that are needed, as well as the kind of efficiency and economics that are needed in order to serve these spaces, we've really struggled in most cases to find off the shelf components that can achieve both of those things, They can achieve the high level of reliability in the really adverse, environmental conditions that we operate in, as well as can achieve the economic efficiency that we need in order to deliver the product that we need in the service that we need to deliver. so that has led to more and more vertical integration and more and more, pulling more components and hardware components, software components, et cetera, in house over time. and I think that's just, we're just doing more of that on the platform two system, as opposed to the platform one system where there are some components on platform one system, even today that we, that we would really like to be able to bring in house. and so we learned on that and kicked off projects to purpose design some of those components for both platform one and platform two. and the, and some of those components are going into platform two first, and then we'll be rolled back into platform one, when we do a design update after they've been proven on the platform two system. Yeah, really excited about some of the opportunities there, and I think that this is a, I think that there's a kind of a, competitive advantages, a bit of a moat here of being able to be a vertically integrated company in this space allows us to achieve the levels of performance, the levels of, safety, these different things that really enable the business and enable the customer experience. I think one more thing I'd add is that answer. The answer I just gave is not just applicable to drones, right? the drone is. a portion, it's an important portion, but it's only a, really a subset, a small subset of the total. Of everything that Zipline needs to do in order to provide our service, right. And if we provide logistic service with our partners, there's also, just to name a few off the top of my head, right. There's the software that's used to manage the fleet of aircraft to dispatch the right aircraft with the right level of battery charge to the right order at the right time. the software that the controllers use, our remote pilots and command use for monitoring the fleet. There's a fulfillment systems that we use to manage inventory. there's integrations with our partners. There's the ordering apps that we build. There's all of the. manufacturing and quality systems. There's, all of the ground systems that we use, the communication systems, all of the things, And Zipline is definitely not a drone company. We're absolutely, a company that provides, logistics services for our partners, and we're really excited about that. and that leads to a lot of vertical integration across the space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, what external companies do you use for any parts that you just mentioned, you know, from UTM to fulfillment and how much of it is home grown and how much are you using partners?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a combination of both. Absolutely. I say that we're quite vertically integrated, but also there are some really important partners that we have that have enabled zipline to make the progress that we have and that we're also excited about continuing to expand with in the future. Happy to name one or maybe a couple, but, I think one that comes to mind first is NVIDIA. Right. we're more and more increasingly, getting higher autonomy on board the aircraft and that requires compute. And so having the latest, state of the art compute on board that can achieve the cost efficiency, mass efficiency, and, compute capabilities that are needed in order to have the, the flying computer that, that a lot of modern drones are has, it's been a great partnership with Nvidia to be able to achieve that and set us up for scaling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about on the UTM side? Is this something that you're doing yourself? Are you using a USS, how does that work?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:39\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. So on, on the UTM side, so UAS traffic management, we are a part of the Keysight initiative in Dallas and partnership with a number of folks in industry, as well as the FAA and NASA. and we also have, have experience in UTM and in our international markets as well. and Zipline develops our own USS capabilities and, another example of being quite vertically integrated in the space is, developing, building those capabilities to, to interface with other companies and UTM service providers in an efficient way that enables our business.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, quite a number of people that we talked to privately, are expressing skepticism about the P2 design, pointing to the complexity and associated cost of it and wondering whether Zipline can really be profitable in the delivery of low value goods with this kind of platform. What is it that they're missing? How do you respond to something like that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. it's, it's not an easy problem to solve, right? it is a complex, highly integrated system. and we have focused on providing, we focus on that home delivery use case from the beginning of the design and everything that is needed in order to achieve that, the high level of safety and reliability, the, the delivery experience, including really designing for noise, being able to integrate. So we want to be able to integrate really efficiently into our partner facilities to be able to create that. we, the terms we use, create a magical portal in the wall that allows our partners to ship products to where it needs to go really efficiently. So these are some of the aspects that we've been focusing on the design. As far as, some of the potential skepticism, You really need to understand the system that you're designing and what are, what the main levers are, So designing for, autonomy, designing for longevity of the system and, cycles on the airframe, designing for operational efficiency and high utilization. all of these factors, designing for maintenance, right? All, all of these factors are really key and being able to. to bring to life a highly integrated, complex system to be able to serve our partners and achieve the use cases that we're focused on achieving.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are some of the gates either in terms of, utilization or the level of automation or human involvement or, the cost of the overall system, or any other gates that you need to achieve in order to, be able to profitably deliver a cup of coffee with the P2.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, from the beginning, we've designed the system for scale. that means, manufacturing scale, that means operational scale, all of these things. With scale comes economic benefits. and so we're really excited to have, a lot of the partners that we have, across, healthcare space internationally in the U. S. I mentioned, national healthcare system. We're expanding with this later this year and the UK, the Cleveland Clinic in the U. S., and the retail space, Walmart and the restaurant space, Sweetgreen and others. really excited about our partners and how are partners in general are really looking to scale, They're really looking to not just do a demo, do a pilot, see how it's received, but be able to achieve levels of scale. And that's when the economics start to work out, right. Is when you're, is when you're achieving scale with some of these partners and some of these systems, that's when, yeah, the, it can really make a positive impact in the community. And also that's when everything starts to pan out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And when you say scale, what do you assume in terms of utilization of drone, let's say in the unit of hour, is that, 3, 4 deliveries, 5, 6, 7?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I mean, it, depends, right. I'm happy to give some, some rough numbers, but it depends. It depends on how far away you're flying. It depends on the weather conditions. It depends on a lot of factors. But, if we're, we're doing a couple to a few deliveries in an hour, that's a good, that's a good hour for an aircraft. And that includes, getting loaded, flying out to the delivery site, delivering, going back to, get charged and get loaded again. So yeah, being able to do, two, two or three deliveries over the course of an hour is a productive, utilization of the asset.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned NVIDIA and autonomy earlier. It's interesting. We recently saw an interview with ValorEquity, one of your investors. It was a much broader conversation around AI and LLMs, but Zipline came up as an example of the vertical AI investments that this firm is making and how Zipline has an AI advantage. What do you think about this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that our flight experience has allowed us to continually improve our system, understand the environment we're operating in, and continually improve the, reliability, robustness and performance of our systems. and I think that includes. In the autonomy space, That includes in the ability to automate these systems, make them more and more capable and safe and powerful as time goes on. And yeah, I do think that, Zipline does use, artificial intelligence techniques, machine learning, et cetera, in order to. better understand our environment and ensure that we're continually improving the safety and efficiency of our operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How much of AI is used, currently or importantly, how much of it has been used in Africa?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Like I mentioned, we're continually using the flight experience that we have in order to improve the system. And so, yeah, they're, from weather prediction to flight controls, to autonomy and perception. There's artificial intelligence that we've deployed in different aspects of the business where it makes sense. Again, coming back to the basics where. we're not a company that's focused on developing technology because for the sake of developing the technology, right, we're focused on providing a service, and really scaling our operations and the value we're able to provide. And so I do think that we have taken a pretty pragmatic approach to leveraging. artificial intelligence and advances in those spaces in order to further the mission and continually improve safety operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Got it. Eric, as you think about, scaling the operations in the U. S., what do you consider as some of the top strategic decisions, whether this is, where to go, what geographies or, the depth of, of the experience and the capacity, or, the partnerships that you need to create. What's top of your mind from a strategic perspective?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I spend a lot of time thinking about this. I think one of the things that is really important to me and to us, as we're thinking about expanding more in the United States, specifically, is Identifying the markets and the partners and the airspaces and, the weather conditions and all these areas where we can provide an excellent customer experience. And an excellent partner experience. And, and the good news is that there's quite a few of those. it's not everywhere in the world, But there's quite a few of those where we have conviction that, that this year we're able to expand into a lot of these areas and so being able to just being really thoughtful about how do we expand the business in the right communities with the right use cases in order to set up that kind of, magical first experiences with the community and with our partners to be able to have those positive first impressions and then be able to layer on and expand and scale from there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about, relationships with, the likes of, the aggregators like DoorDash? Do you see competing with them or perhaps, partnering with them like, Manna has been rumored to have done in the U. S.?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, we see a ton of demand, for people just want faster deliveries, straight to their doorstep with a great customer experience. There's tons of demand in the space and I think there's different ways to integrate into, that last mile logistics spaces. A lot of our partners, like I mentioned, are in the healthcare world, for both deliveries to, pharmaceuticals to homes, for example, but also for Inter facility transfers of, samples and different things to improve healthcare efficiency, which we're really excited about, but also in the, in the retail and in the restaurant space, there's, like I said, there's different ways that we, that we could integrate in, that a drone delivery system can integrate in. Currently our partnerships are with the, the service providers directly. So we're working with Walmart, we're working with Sweetgreens, we're working with these different, retail and restaurant companies directly to provide, delivery services directly to their customers. So that, that's where we fit into the space, but, yeah, we're just excited to, to make the biggest impact we can to enable, drone delivery and positively impact the environment and these communities. And so we're, we're open minded to figure out the best way to do that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Eric, when you work with these partners and when you think about the rate at which you expand the service offering. What do you see as the rate limiters to the expansion of drone delivery? Certainly in contrast, DoorDash itself was able to expand very rapidly, just because of the nature of the service. But with drone delivery and with the people and infrastructure that you need to put in place, what are the expectations, for what that's going to look like, the rate, and also will it be concentrated on a geographic basis, city by city, or will it be initially more spread out and then filling in with capacity over time?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:12:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good question. I think that, I think it's going to be somewhere in between, right, on both of those. So I don't expect that drone delivery will expand like micro mobility did where they're seemingly we woke up one day and there were scooters all over the sidewalks in some places. I think that drone delivery will be very thoughtfully expanded in partnership with, the federal government, with FAA and other partners, as well as with, the local community, but I also think that there's an opportunity to scale pretty quickly, So I think thoughtfully and, metro by metro or neighborhood by neighborhood, but I do think that there's an opportunity to grow pretty quickly. And as far as the, Go wide and fill in or go deep type question. I think the most likely answer is somewhere in between where, there's two, I think there's two different pulling factors. I'm not sure what the ideal answer is or the optimal solution is, but one factor is that as you build a pretty deep network in one Metro, there's benefits of that network, right? There's benefits of being able to provide quite a bit of service. different infrastructure, charging, logistics, all of these things that you really can provide more and more service more and more efficiently in those communities as you go deeper, which might lead you to, go deep in a place before going wide into multiple. But at the same time, we're super excited about the partners that we've, been working with recently and we'll be working with over the next couple of years, and a lot of those partners are regional, especially on the healthcare side, they're operating in certain areas. And so there's a pull from our partners to be able to grow and scale and launch quickly. And so I think there's going to be a bit of both where we'll go into one metro area, work on going reasonably deep, and then, jump in the next, jump in the next.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:13:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Eric, what is the next five to 10 years look like in our industry? And how is it different than what most people are talking about today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:14:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. I think it comes back to the kind of opening of the conversation where I think one of the main misconceptions is that drone delivery is, and, scaling UAS is somewhere off on the horizon. And there's a number of obstacles that are in the way. and I think that, really it just depends where you live, There are places in the world where drone delivery is here today and is dependent upon. And my expectation of what the next five years, 10 years looks like is, I'm really excited for being able to bring that to more and more communities, So I think that there's different types of aircraft that are, executing drone deliveries in different markets, different niches, that are all, working efficiently together in order to help everyone live a better, more efficient life for the environment, for, safety, for all of these things. So I'm really excited about the, and optimistic about what the future holds in this space and how it can integrate into the next five to 10 years of our life as we grow.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:15:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you've been part of a very successful company for many years. You know, it started in 13 or 14. What advice would you give to our innovators? Our entrepreneurs that are listening. That may be unique.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:15:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the main piece of advice is to an entrepreneur getting started today would be to tackle a real problem, I think that, it's all too often that an entrepreneur comes about with a technology or with a solution, and then they spend their time looking for a problem to solve. As opposed to coming in and identifying, whether that's through their own personal experience and pain points, or, through insight they may have into the market, being able to identify a real challenge and a real opportunity. and I would just recommend entrepreneurs to, to make sure that you're identifying that challenge, identifying the opportunity and staying focused on burning down the risk to making that successful, As efficiently as you possibly can. and sometimes that includes technology development. Sometimes it may not. but just making sure that we're, efficiently focusing on solving the problem we set out to solve.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:16:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you certainly did that in Africa. Listen, I've heard a Keller, your CEO and he delivers a really inspirational message. And their problem you guys targeted and how you solve that problem. I wanted to ask given the time you've spent in Africa, Eric, what message would you give to Americans\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Eric:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:16:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a good one. There's just so much, it's so interesting and you have to go experience it yourself, I guess would be my main message. there's so much that's different, but there's so much that's the same, and so it's hard to explain the, that, that spread of where at some, in some ways it's the same problems in the same world and in other ways, it's just so different. I think you can say that about, probably any two, two countries and different communities and, cultures and whatnot. But, but yeah, it's just been such a pleasure to, work with, the partners that we have and the communities that we've been fortunate enough to be able to make an impact in those spaces and in our own way. So yeah, it's just been a really positive. part of my life and my career so far.

Welcome back to The Vertical Space and a terrific conversation with John Langford, CEO of Electra. John has over 30 years of experience in this space, so he knows what's been done and believes he has an elegant, smart approach to our industry with Electra. We talk about the key drivers for, and what becomes first in advanced air mobility and how factors such as market acceptance, use case, certification, tech readiness, and infrastructure requirements dictate what type of vehicles will fly first with commercial relevance. We extensively discussed eSTOL its advantages and disadvantages compared to other proposed vehicle types of today. He explains that most use cases don't need pure vertical or hovering. John explains why Electra decided to use blown lift, STOL technology and hybrid electric power. He discusses how there are no mode changes in Electra's aircraft. And that's why he believes Electra has several advantages. We discuss Electra, its unique characteristics and market fit. Listen to what use cases they're targeting with a soccer field sized operating spaces. And John's response to Luka's questions of the regulatory path of landing and taking off from a soccer field. He also makes clear that there'll be selling and not operating their aircraft. John mentions that pure electric does deliver on the promise of low noise and that the hybrid power may require pure electric in different areas and use cases. We then discuss Aurora Flight Sciences, why they started what they did for the first decade and their challenges, their pivot and trigger point for their success the importance of Global Hawk. And their years of subsequent success and their eventual acquisition by Boeing. Listen, we enjoyed this conversation for a variety of reasons, but one standout is that no other guest has referenced as many of our podcasts and guests as John has in this conversation. So, John, thanks for joining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy this conversation with John Langford, as you innovate in The Vertical Space.

John Langford, welcome to The Vertical Space. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's great to be here. Thank you.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First question we ask everyone, is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, if you judge by the responses to the SFARs that were put out last summer, we at Electra have a pretty different view than much of the industry on what those SFARs said. So I would start with that. There's three big pieces that are fundamental to that in the SFARs. The first is reserves. The second is training and particularly the use of onboard pilots and two seats. And the third is the whole issue of a powered lift category and a special type cert Our response to the SFARs that the FAA put out, the draft for comment, there were sort of two people who responded in favor of it, Electra and the Airline Pilots Association. And then pretty much everybody else came, came out against it and, and saying that it would be, everything from, an inconvenience to an industry killer. And you've had a lot of the other guests, on there who've spoken, to that, in the past. on our part, from Electra's point of view, I think the reserves, the issue of reserves speaks to the whole fundamental issue of electric propulsion, how it really fits into aviation, whether it's ready for prime time, and I assume it's something we'll spend a lot of time on today. But, I do think the issues on reserves, on training, and on the powered lift types are, are three things that clearly the industry and Electra probably take different views on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, just go into a little more detail on each if you could.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it was interesting at the Honeywell summit, which you guys were at and did a piece on. one of the eVTOL's CEOs made a comment to the effect that a requirement for 45 minute reserves, they couldn't even fly for 45 minutes, much less have 45 minutes of reserves. And, we nodded and said, yeah, that's what we've been saying for five or six years. And, and so the question of, do you make airplanes fit into the current regime? And, that includes the sort of safety regime. Or how much do you modify the environment to fit the capabilities or lack of capabilities of the new, aircraft. And I think that's really a really central issue. I can spend, I'd like to spend, in, in just a second, a fair amount of time on, a quick view of electric propulsion. But I think reserves are really fundamental and the reserves are not arbitrary numbers that have been made up, they're something that has been developed over many years and proven by experience. They'll probably will need to be somewhat modified for some of the new capabilities, but, I think you, you face a big sort of dichotomy in the aviation world today where the standards of safety are so high in the Part 25 world, and people project that to all other phases of aviation, and then to start right off with saying, well, we have to modify the existing safety regime in order for these new airplanes to work at all should give people pause. And certainly at Electra, the whole business plan is built around the assumption that we have to operate in today's regulatory environment, in today's airspace because the way you get a return on an investment is to, minimize the amount of time that investment is sitting out there before it can produce revenues. And so our whole business plan is designed to fit into the existing regulatory structure as it is, today. And I think that's a pretty big difference between us and most of the other players in the AAM, the new entrants into the AAM market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, have you heard any credible arguments in favor of changing the reserve requirements? Is there something about the concept of operations or the flight environments that are different from when those reserves were initially determined? And by the way, do you know the history of how the industry converged on 30 minutes for VFR, 45 for IFR\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you've asked the other guests that question, and I'll give you the same answer they did, which is no. ha\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you for listening.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's no real physics based argument and I know a lot of people are going we're gonna be flying short distances and we're gonna know where all the landing sites are all the time but you know as a former glider pilot and somebody at Electra, we spend a lot of time looking at landing sites and when we talk about Electra, that's a big part of what we're doing is opening up new places to operate out of. And while there are a lot of landing places, there are not infinite numbers of possibilities where you can conduct a, a safe, non emergency landing, and we are not trying to build, a chairlift here, right, which operates from one point to another point and nothing in between, we think that what you have to have is a system that can go anywhere. A lot of What Electra's focus is to decarbonize aviation, but also to expand the places aviation can operate. And, and if you're going to do that, you cannot have something where you are built around assumptions that you always know where you're starting. You always know where you're ending and you're operating like a chairlift or something.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You talked about, training as the second.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, the Electra airplane is built with two seats up front. It is intended as a, single pilot operation, nine seat aircraft. But there are two piloting stations up front. Now that initially came from just listening to our customers. Many of whom said, look, the kinds of things we want to do with this airplane includes building time as part of the pilot training pipeline, right, the, and so our customers want to use it as a training tool, a tool for building time as pilots move up from ab initio trainers, which that's not what we're building, but we assume you're already a licensed pilot by the time you get into this. But that you build time in order to move up towards the 1, 500 hour number and, that's part of what the customers want to see. And so that's very consistent, I think, with the FAA's approach that while they think simulator training is great, particularly for upset training, they still want you to have time with an experience, with a, be able to do check rides, right, in the airplane. And, I agree with that. I certainly I've heard the arguments, oh, well, F 35s, are single seat airplanes, but most of the military airplanes historically, even the single seaters, there's some two seat version that you work up to, and the military doesn't start you off in those super high end airplanes. So we looked at it. We think it's just extremely prudent, to be able to use this as a training device, even though it's certified and we expect most of the revenue operations will be flown single pilot. The third is the powered lift certification piece where, you know, it's goes back to the V 22 thing, and this is one of the questions that I ask anecdotally, but have never really gotten a great answer to, which is the V22 and the AW609 have very long, very expensive development histories behind them by teams of people who were well funded and knew what they were doing, and have struggled to get into certification. The AW609 is still working on that and there are unique things about airplanes that have these mode changes that fly from vertical flight profiles to horizontal flight profiles in that transition, and while a lot of that will certainly be masked in the flight control systems, it is still a very different animal. When we built the Electra airplane, one of the key advantages that we think is that there are no mode changes in what we're doing. It's a conventional airplane with a wing, from the beginning of the flight to the end of the flight. and that is, the basis of a lot of, what we think are the both operational efficiencies, which translates into costs, and also operational safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You in one of your presentations, John, caught my attention. There's a reason why the President's flying in a helicopter and he's being escorted by two V 22s.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, and we saw that yesterday at Manassas. The president came out to give a speech close by and Marine One flew right into the terminal there and it was a helicopter older than, well, not all of us on this call, but many of the people who work at Electra, those helicopters are older than, but yeah, absolutely, if the concept's not safe enough for the president of the United States to fly on, why is it safe enough for me to put my kid or my mother on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, John, an elemental stem cell question, what comes first in advanced air mobility? What drives the need for the first commercial vehicle?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it all starts with an air vehicle that works, and I can't think of another time in aviation where we're talking about certification and huge expenditures on new infrastructure for an airplane no passengers have flown on and we have no passenger feedback about whether people are even going to want to fly on these aircraft. So I'm a big believer that what comes first is you gotta make the airplanes work, and that means not flying them just in private tests, but actually in public use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the point you need to be able to roll out a vehicle that's actually going work. So many the use cases in advanced air mobility you would think could be more economically and safely addressed with eSTOL versus eVTOL. Talk about that a little bit. You've already highlighted in this conversation, there's a lot of challenges with vertical lift. You talked about cost but I'm sure you will. But there's a safety concern in the transition, but it seems like an awful lot of the missions in regional air mobility, and in other areas that they can be better served by the eSTOL.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, let me talk a little bit about how we came to the idea of Electra and it was through building a lot of eVTOL airplanes. At my previous company, Aurora Flight Sciences, we can talk more about Aurora in a second, but we were primarily in a rapid prototyping operation, we built all kinds of advanced aircraft concepts, and that's what we offered to our customers. And we did electric airplanes really from day one, or we tried to, right? The very first airplanes we started building in 1989 for high altitude use were intended to be electric originally. In fact, battery electric using, one shot lithium thionyl chloride batteries to, to get to very high altitude so you didn't have to build an air breathing propulsion system that worked at 85, 000 feet. In about the mid 2000s, starting in about 2002 and then flying in 2009, we did a hybrid electric airplane called Excalibur for the Army that had a gas turbine and a generator and three electrically driven lift fans that also had batteries. And then we did a program for DARPA that was called the XV 24 Lightning Strike, which was a very large turbine driving generators, 3 megawatts worth of electricity, driving 28 fans buried in the wing. It ended up being a tilt wing to get the, the high speed and the VTOL, working together in that. And as part of that program, we also did a subscale demonstrator, which was purely battery powered and autonomous. And we used that to demonstrate the full flight envelope. And then we went from there into a program with Uber, which for an airplane that we called the Pegasus and Boeing called the PAV. And then we did a proprietary program with, with Porsche. So we built a lot of eVTOLs of almost every configuration you can imagine and everyone that's out there and some that aren't. And when we went to go study how to put it into production, we spent a lot of time trying to come up with a design that could beat existing airplanes. I was in a lot of design reviews in which I would go, look, we're not going to spend all this money, hundreds of millions of dollars, to come up with an electric airplane that doesn't have the performance of a Robinson, okay? We never were able to do that with, battery electric designs, but what did happen was some guys up at MIT, John Hansman and Mark Drayla and one of their grad students, Chris Corton, began to say, hey, look, for most use cases, it does not have to be strictly vertical, right? What you really care about is the runway independence. There are some cases where you have to hover, where you need that pure vertical, or you need that pure hover capability. You always will, and so those will be the province of, of, helicopter designs, but in most other cases, every other case that doesn't have that absolute requirement for vertical or hovering, you're better off with the physics of a wing, and a wing is essentially a thrust multiplier, whereas with a VTOL design, all of the lift is provided by the thrust, so you know, you have to have thrust higher than your weight. And in a normal airplane, what a wing does is act as a thrust multiplier. So if you have a 10 to 1, lift to drag ratio, you can get away with 1 10th the thrust that you would need if you were trying to take off vertically. And, that gives you a physics advantage that, is why most airplanes that you see are, what we call CTOL, or you use a wing throughout the entire flight envelope. The science that Electra is harnessing in this is a technique called blown lift, which is something that has been around for, oh, 50 years or more, since NASA in the 60s and then 70s really pioneered it, and the French and the Japanese, and there were some Air Force programs that looked at this. By blowing the wing, bathing the wing in carefully designed flap systems and with the higher velocity air from the propulsion system, you could get lift coefficients that were multiples of what you could get from a conventional sort of static configuration system. So instead of getting, a lift coefficient of two and a half, you could get lift coefficients approaching ten. And if you can do that, you can fly much slower, and if you can fly more slowly, you can take off and land in very short distances. Blown lift as it was developed in the 60s and 70s was always that it was being done with gas turbines. And gas turbines, are basically, well, if you look at the history of CTOL airplanes, we've gone from four engines to three engines to two engines, and people would go to one gas turbine if they could, obviously they don't because of the redundancy need to be able to lose one at takeoff, but, you essentially pay for the maintenance cost by the gas turbine. So the blown lift wants continuous blowing across the wing in an infinite number of propulsors and the gas turbines want to have one propulsor. And so that was fundamentally the problem of, the early blown lift designs was they were never economical matching with the propulsion systems that are available. The insight that Hansman and Drayla and Corton brought to this was that distributed electric propulsion actually solves that problem. And so with the electric motors, you can now have good specific power and good efficiencies on a number of small propulsors and, the exact number you have to optimize, but a lot more than two, we have eight on the airplanes that we're doing, which matches very well to the requirements of blown lift. And so that's the fundamental physics behind what Electra is trying to do. It gives you a two to three times the useful load fraction compared to a vertical lift design, for a given vehicle weight and a given mission. And then we spend that advantage in a couple of ways. We spend some of it in, we have a better useful load fraction than a VTOL design. But we also spend some of it in things like development costs and in manufacturing costs that we're focused on how you reduce the non recurring costs by not being highly vertically integrated, but by using more COTS components, and I don't mean commercial COTS, just other aerospace level components, and we can talk more about that, and then in the recurring, we're, we have not settled yet in the production of how much is going to be composite and how much is going to be metal, but, we don't have to use the ultimate lightweight solutions that the VTOL folks get driven to because we have that physics advantage that we can spend in a couple of different ways. And overall, we think it's going to make a much more cost effective proposition both for the operators and as a business than anything else we have been able to come up with, and that includes, as I said, looking at pretty much every eVTOL concept, out there. So that was the genesis of when I, left Aurora and started Electra about three years ago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So John, you were looking for design and you saw this insight that distributed electric propulsion enables a really effective blown wing design. What beyond that helped you refine that down into a product and commit to that product? What mission set did you want to go and target with this aircraft?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we started with the whole suite of urban and regional air mobility missions. One of the beautiful things about the eSTOL, particularly when you couple it with the hybrid electric propulsion, essentially the blown lift gives you the very short runway capability, and the hybrid gives you the ability to go long distances, and in this case, long distances is hundreds of miles. And so we look at the whole set of missions. One of the things we, announced this week is we've crossed the 2, 000, pre orders, or letters of intent for the 9 seat airplane that we're developing. And you just look at the range of folks who are buying that and what they are planning to do with it. And it basically breaks out into helicopter operators. Our launch customer was Bristow, one of the world's premier helicopter operators. The people who really understand both the pluses, but also the minuses particularly in terms of cost and noise of helicopters today, and we believe we can operate at 70 percent less direct operating costs than the helicopters they're flying today, and to get in and out of all of the heliports, for example, that ring Manhattan. And so the first people who are really interested in that are the helicopter operators, right? Then we move into, the second category, sort of regional air service providers who want to expand the number of destinations that they go to. The kinds of things that we're offering, if you can get in and out of a soccer field sized location there are a lot of things you can do around the world. Our level zero requirement, as we call it, is to be able to get in and out of Wall Street Heliport, right? That facility is what we have chosen as sizing our capability, that's where the 300 foot by 100 foot operating space comes from in our requirements is that existing piece of infrastructure at the Wall Street Heliport. And there's space at the other heliports that ring Manhattan for that as well, although like at 30th Street West, you can't actually fly directly into that today. There's a barge that's big enough that would have to be refurbished, and there's a horizontal space parallel to the river at 30th Street that is large enough, but has a temporary building in the center of it, but the Wall Street Heliport you can fly in and out of today is the idea, and everybody in this market is talking about the airport shuttle mission to go from Wall Street to JFK or to Newark or whatever. That's what Blade does today and we start with that mission and we can certainly do that mission and we can do it at significantly lower cost than Blade is doing it today with the helicopters. But then we can keep going with the airplane and you can go to the Hamptons or to Martha's Vineyard or Boston. Or you can keep going further and you can go to Washington, D. C. We spend a lot of time working that route between New York and Washington. Because if you look at that today, it's about four hours at a minimum. No matter how you go, whether you drive, take the train, fly commercial, it all starts at four hours and goes up depending on what kind of delays you may encounter. And the only way to, to really save time is to get in closer. This is not a case where going faster in the airplane really makes that big of a difference. You can take a private aircraft from D. C. up to New York, but you're going into Teterboro or Westchester and you've still got to get down to Manhattan, so our view is you've got to be able to get into Manhattan with whatever device you're talking about and that's what our level zero requirement is. Once you can do that, then you can go all kinds of places. You can go to, places like Santa Monica, which are existing airports, but which, carriers like JSX can't get into today, but which they would love to access and which we can because of both the space and the noise that we the quiet operations and the short field operations will be able to do non interfering approaches into places like into big airports JFK, but will also be able to operate off of the tops of parking garages which will allow us, we think, to get into places like Tyson's Corner, which is, a couple miles from where I'm sitting. It'll allow us to operate out of big warehousing distribution centers. It'll allow us to go into destinations, like islands that don't have airports that might have ferry service or helicopter service, but don't have an airport for a fixed wing service. There's actually a lot of those out there. Obviously, it allows you to do every road as a runway. today roads are emergency runways for airplanes, of course. But in the medical evacuation or in the defense applications, we use a lot less road than others. And the 300 by 100 foot is about the size of a soccer field, and if you go and look around the world at how many soccer fields there are and where they are it's amazing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If I was building an aircraft that was range constrained, I could only effectively go 25 or 30 miles in my mission, then yeah, I would focus on these urban centers finding a way to make that mission profile work from downtown to the airport and all of that. But that comes with so much baggage and you have an aircraft that is far more versatile. And so why even focus on those missions first? The last few things that you mentioned, going to places that people want to get to, but there isn't a small airport there, to me, that seems like such a layup for you. And why not focus on that first? Or maybe you don't care. Maybe you're just in the business of selling airframes and the customers will fly them where they will.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the other things that we are adamant about is that we're not the operator. We're not trying to be our own user. We are going to, established other customers and that's part of that 2000 pre orders is it's something like 40 different customer organizations, and one of the beauties of those pre orders is it puts you inside an NDA veil that you can, operate where you can tell them what you're really doing and they can tell you what they want to do and what they're really doing and the things that they want, the features that they want on their product and, and that is, that's basically what we're focused on is listening to the customers, and making sure we deliver what they want. At the same time, you have to have a visionary element as well to it. It's the Steve Jobs iPhone, analogy, right? That people aren't really good at market research because it doesn't really help you on things that don't exist today because people don't really know what they want if they've never had one. And so we're balancing that, right, between the existing missions, which will be the early adopters, some of which are even literally direct replacements for airplanes that are in the fields today, and the expansion markets that are enabled by the new capabilities that airplane offers. We think that's one of the things that makes it such a robust plan, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. think you're bringing forward a versatile aircraft that you put it in the hands of the customers and let them show how they're going to use it, rather than, of the other companies in the space being so prescriptive with this incredible new set capabilities. And they have very narrow vision how end users going access. I'm a big fan of letting the industry discover how customers are going to use it by putting a versatile platform in their hand and something that's really multi mission capable and then watch them apply it and learn from that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We absolutely agree with you.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>what is the, regulatory path to landing an aircraft in a soccer field?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you can do it today with a helicopter, right? It's the same, structure there is on, operating on the same flight rules and stuff as helicopters are today. The, the joke in the helicopter the field is you can land a helicopter anywhere once and, and honestly, as we look at our business plan, particularly for some of the things like where you're dealing with, establishing commuter services to towns, to communities that don't have an existing airport, or you're going to do, package e pickup or delivery to not just between distribution centers, but even to retail stores, that we think that the local regulations will be an important part of this. And that's why we go back constantly to the noise, right? And why we go back constantly to the need to get these things out there and, and begin to demonstrate. And, I think what happened a few weeks ago in New York when Joby and Volocopter did demonstration flights off of the Wall Street heliport and they were very warmly received. And there's always some laws of unintended consequences right, when people say hey that's really, yeah, that's really quiet, that's all these other guys, right, say, now that option exists, we're not going to let into our space, That\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>be\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>things that you see,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, I want to ask you a quick question given you brought up the noise. what's your noise signature versus Joby? say\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>signature is.

And, there's probably people listening to podcast right now, some of whom may be critics of eSTOL. So give a little bit of a flavor first of all, what's the noise difference? Would electric eVTOL companies say, I have a significant noise advantage over eSTOL, or at least a hybrid eSTOL, which you have? And then just give us a quick rundown on what would the critics of eSTOL say overall?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>34:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, let me start out with the promise of lower noise is definitely one of the promises of electric that I think electric can deliver on, right? There's a lot of hype and promise around electric aviation in general, much of which I think will be very hard for that people to deliver on, and we can talk about that more in a second, but I think noise is one of the ones that really will, because the motors are definitely quieter. If you have a lot of small props, you can have lower tip speeds, and then the design of the props is, advanced quite a bit. So there, there's no question that these things are going to be a lot quieter. Will the difference between the eVTOL and an eSTOL pure electric mode, will you be able to tell? I doubt it. I don't have specific numbers today. It's all aspect, angle dependent and stuff. But I will say that in the flying we're doing today, we do have a chase plane and you never hear the electric airplane if the chase plane is in the air. We are collecting noise data on that, and it's great, and, we're super excited about that. I think the electric airplane promise of lower noise will be delivered on by everybody. On the hybrid, obviously we have a generator on there, a turbo generator in our case. It's small and we're working to make it quiet on the two seat tech demonstrator that we're flying today it was designed to be inexpensive, so that turbo generator is not particularly quiet, but the airplanes are designed to be flown, and we've tested this, that's why we did our first flight purely electric, because, we are working to make sure in all modes, it's extremely quiet, but we recognize that there are some cases when you want to be, completely our airplane can operate without the turbo generator on. And the analogy I give on that is, is, with your, a Prius, right? When you pull out of the driveway, you're probably operating purely electric, and when you get out on the freeway, the, gas engine kicks in and that's how you get the range. And I think operationally you're going to see a similar thing with the hybrid airplanes. In cases where there's an extreme noise sensitivity, like some of the military missions or some of these close in neighborhood missions, you'll probably will be flying them purely electric for the part where you're low. The other big thing of course besides emitting noise is how much are you emitting at the source, and then what is the trajectory, right? One of the ways that the big turbofans really benefited noise reduction on current jets, of course, is that when you had two of them, you climb a lot faster than the older jets did, and therefore you get away from the ground, and therefore you expose a lot less, surface area. And the eSTOL does that as well with the steep approaches in both, both for takeoff and landing, that, that's another factor in how you minimize the ground exposure. It's also another thing most people don't realize about the eVTOL airplanes, which is that everybody pictures them taking off and landing straight up and down. That's not how helicopters work, but the big thing on the eVTOLs is you take off vertically, but then you've got to get on the wing as fast as possible\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's talk about eSTOL safety case and how you are going to approach safe, slow flight, let's take, final approach with the aircraft. What is final approach speed and what are the safety concerns you and the team had to overcome with that and what do you expect is going to need to be accounted for in the certification process for this? And we talk about, slow speed control, we talk about wind shear, talk about power loss on final approach. Walk us through that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. One of the interesting things about a powered lift airplane, about the eSTOL operation, is that the stall speed is no longer a function just of the geometry of the airplane, the way it is in a normal conventional CTOL airplane. What's the flap setting, right? And that's, that's going to pretty much determine the stall speed. In our case, it's also a function of throttle setting, because of the blown lift. With the blown lift, you're flying at speeds considerably below the power-off stall speed. We are expecting to be operating, 30 to 35 knots in the approach regime of these airplanes. That means that if you're coming into a place like the Wall Street Heliport, you have to have multiple levels of redundancy in the powertrain. And that is one of the beauties of, the, of distributed electric.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, so approach to safety is that we're not to allow the power to fail through redundancy and reliability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's eight motors, there's four batteries, there's two generators, and there's one turbine in, in those, and it's sized so that if you lost the turbine on a critical part of the approach you have, more than enough battery capability. Even if one of the battery systems fails, one of the strings, one of the buses, you can lose two motors in any, scenario. And that's to handle the extreme STOL, and obviously, one of the other beauties of this design at its heart, it's a conventional airplane with a fixed wing and so A complete power loss situation in a a battery vertical lift airplane, you're gonna come down. And, in the electro eSTOL concept, you're going to glide down. That's a much safer situation. We saw that just last week, in Loudoun County, not far from here. a Caravan coming out of Dulles. And so, we think that's an important, safety feature.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the other aerodynamic risk factors in slow speed flight in the traffic pattern on final, that your aircraft needs to designed around?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, obviously one of the things about flying slow is wind and turbulence. One of the really great things about the electric propulsion, and this is again why we think it's the marriage of distributed electric and blown lift that really is the enabler to make all this work, is that you can now use the different electric propulsors as part of your control system, and in fact, we, we do that in the design that the differential thrust, for example, is mixed right in to, the yaw control and also into the roll control and it's actually a strong pitch actuator as well and well, so you have tremendous control effectiveness that you don't have in a normal airplane, where the control get squishier the slower you go, and ultimately, you lose control authority. That's, that does not happen on these blown lift airplanes. That's one of the advantages of this is that you have very powerful control actuators all the way through the flight envelope. And we plan to use them. That's one of the ways you handle, gusts and turbulence and things like that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so how does this apply toward preventing one wing from stalling and causing a spin and et cetera? Will this system be designed to account that and prevent that as part of the envelope protection?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is power by wire, first off, and then the entire airplane is a fly by wire, and while I think pretty much every, you get arguments about how much autonomy people have in the AAM space, but I think pretty much everybody buys into the idea that it's a fly by wire system, and so much so that we often don't comment on that or talk about it. But, I would just note that at the moment there are no Part 23, certified fly-by-wire systems. There are in military jets, there are in bigger airplanes, but the certification piece of that is, important and is significant. It doesn't have challenges of autonomy, the unknown pieces but it also shouldn't be taken for granted. What you get out of FBW is the ability to have protection throughout it, just as you do on the A320 or the big jets. And that'll be a big part of this. Absolutely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. And then with respect to my last, question on this is, low level wind shear. What does that present for this type of very slow flight? What type of risk does low level wind shear present? The airplane perhaps finding itself on short final, an increased sink\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What do you need to be especially wary of at these types of speeds how do you solve for\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>that? That, that is one of the things that we are looking at It's related to the other piece of this is the precision touchdown, part, that it's, it's pretty easy to take off of a, in 150 feet on a 300 foot space, it's pretty easy to take off in those conditions, and landing, if you need only 100 or 150 feet of ground roll, that's not too bad. But if you've only got 300, you've got to hit the space exactly. And so that's one of the real, that we see as one of the challenges in this. And that's where, while there's no autonomy per se in this airplane, there's a lot of automation and a lot of work is going into the pilot guidance and exactly what roles the pilot is playing and the flight computer is playing. Hitting a precise touchdown point. There is no flare planned for what we're doing, okay, so we come straight in, if you have an aim point, we're gonna hit that, but your point is, well, do you know the atmospheric profile between here and there? And that is a research topic on whether we are going to, in some cases, need you know, a LIDAR profiler or some kind of atmospheric profiler in these, very very short spaces. We are trying hard not to because we are big believers in light infrastructure but we have not ruled out that you might need to put some kind of atmospheric profiler at these very small spaces, particularly if there's large building obstacles or stuff around, so you could feed forward, essentially in real time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, so you're saying it's really these extremely small landing spaces where this becomes stringent because otherwise if there's wind shear day and you're landing on thousand foot runway you just increase your approach speed like airplane would you account for it that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, exactly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John, tying back to one of the comments Peter made earlier about the market opportunity outside of these 300 foot balanced field lengths, have you given thought to the idea that maybe this is too complex tackling some of these issues and there's enough of a market opportunity in some conventional missions where you're introducing an aircraft that has significant direct operating costs savings. So, why not go and utilize existing 2000 foot runways and avoid these kinds of safety issues that we just talked about and go serve those missions and there's plenty of those. What is the benefit of having the capability to land on a 300 foot field? And, what does that translate directly to market opportunities?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We've looked at this, it's a great question, and we've looked at this, in sort of, I'll broaden the question to how you use blown lift, and, the NASA X 57 and the Electra eSTOL set out to use blown lift in two different ways, right? Essentially what the physics of the blown lift do is make the wing look aerodynamically like it's larger than it physically is, and we use that to have a large wing which gives slow speeds and therefore short takeoff and landing, and the X 57 was focusing it more on CTOL mode and have efficiencies in cruise. And I think that, where you set that knob depends on the mission that you're trying to do. beat\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'd be really curious to understand, a customer of yours that's in the logistics space, that's in the Caravan space, for instance today, how do they think of the added benefit of, this kind of short field takeoff and landing capabilities, and whether they would be eager to go through the, trouble of setting up a private field and creating, presumably this needs to be an available service, and so you need to be able to go in and out in all weather conditions including IFR, and so that means developing procedures for those airfields. So why not just go to a nearest 2000, foot runway, wherever your current operations exist and utilize an aircraft that is much cheaper and easier to operate?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>48:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Couple of, couple answers to that. The first is that in our analysis, it's not a lot cheaper than, the actual cost for being able to do, both what we would call a very short field urban air mobility mission. Short field, the helicopter, analogy mission, versus the the, sort of Caravan mission on that. And our analysis is that we can do both, but the kinds of things we're looking at, the time savings, I go back to the time savings comes from getting in close from starting and, ending your journey, close to the customer's point of origin and point of destination and, yes, there's an argument that, oh, there's lots of underutilized airports in the U. S. Yeah, and most of them are places people don't want to go. Okay, that's why they're underutilized. Their warehouse is not on an airportand there's 4000 warehouses in the Amazon network alone and the Walmart network alone and you've got 10 or 12 of those players in the US economy and so you have tens of thousands of these middle mile logistics places you'd like to go your you're not going to build conventional airports at all of those. Are you going to be able to take a piece of the existing parking lot and, stripe it off and fence it off and operate aircraft out of there? We think the answer to that question is yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, that's actually one of my questions is, if you have a customer that has these types of facilities and maybe they're, well located next to a highway network, but they want to bring an air capability into those locations and they have the lot or they have open space, walk us through what it would take for them to, be able to fly in and out of there. Do they have to go and deal with zoning county ordinances? Does it happen at the state level? I think a lot of us in the audience know what the fAA has to say about this, paint that picture for types of customers. how easy or hard that going to be for to do?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. Well, yeah, well, and you had Dave Stepanek on, from Bristow, and Dave talked about a lot of this in his interview. What Bristow is looking at is not necessarily flying an E STOL airplane onto an existing oil and gas platform. That's probably going to stay as a helicopter mission, although Electra also says, well, here's how much a barge costs, and a barge that you can operate our airplanes off of is, is actually not an expensive proposition, but be that as may, Bristow's current market, is to expand into exactly that, or in current vision, I, and I not putting words in Dave Stepanek's mouth, he said this on his podcast with you, is exactly to expand into some of these middle mile kinds of things. And who better than helicopter operators to address those questions that you're talking about? We do not have the answer to every question that you answered in there, but you can do all of these missions today with helicopters. It's just not, economically feasible and with the noise, we think not very, sustainable in that. But, you could do air service with helicopters into these distribution points but we think for the middle mile, you need to do a couple of thousand pounds and, we think the economics begin to really work on this size airplane more than some of the smaller UAVs. What's the interesting really going to be to routine drone deliveries in residential areas? We're hoping it's where everybody goes, oh, they notice it the first few times you Do it and then it goes to a background effect.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One question that I wanted to ask was, what extent, John you considered general aviation an an interesting use case. You mentioned, the three up front, but I haven't heard GA that to me is, a really interesting market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, GA is, it goes back to a lot of your autonomy guests that you've had on and discussions. At Aurora, we had a program called Centaur, and Aurora still has that going, which is, a DA 42 that was modified to be an optionally piloted airplane, where there was a human in the left seat and a robot in the right seat, and we did it in a way that it didn't void the normal category certification of the airplane when you put the robot in, and we spent a lot of time making the robot removable and in a way that didn't void the normal category cert, so you could fly it manned in a normal category, you could fly it, robotically in a, in an experimental category then, and we demonstrated that. I personally flew on one of those. And it's pretty weird sitting behind the robot while the robot flies it. There was a safety pilot, of course, on the airplane, but all they did was avoid other traffic right. That was the, their role on that was the detect, see and avoid. And so, I always thought that the real role for autonomy in the US airspace system is really in the revitalization of general aviation. I, I think that's where it's going to ultimately make a huge difference, because if you look at it for the last 50 years, it's been a steady decline of the number of rated pilots, Learning to fly safely in the United States is a little bit of stick and rudder and a lot of procedures. Where a lot of the costs, the proficiency and the, I'll just call it the hassle, comes from. And that's the place that I think autonomy can help the most. So I'm a big believer on general aviation. When I was at Aurora, we were looking at, what it took to get an STC on the automation package and when you talked to Rob Rose a lot of his comments are very familiar, because we looked at all of that and worked on all of that at Aurora, with the goal of getting to a general aviation airplane that you could fly with the kind of, training and proficiency that goes into a driver's license and not what you currently have to have for\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You brought up Aurora, Tell us some highlights from Aurora that you think apply to Advanced Air Mobility that you think our audience be interested to hear about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the first comment I would make about Aurora is that it started out to be an environmental company That the mission of Aurora Flight Sciences, when we started in 1989, was to do robotic airplanes for global climate change research. And for our first decade, that was pretty much our exclusive focus of trying to build new tools for atmospheric scientists to probe the stratosphere. And that turned out to be challenging, primarily in terms of the financial support that is out there for climate research. People seem to have lots of opinions on the climate and it's proven to be remarkably difficult to build a company around, um, the, environmental research tools and the exploration of the stratosphere. Aurora pivoted, about, 8 to 10 years into its history to being what I would call more conventional UAV markets, meaning that we got into the defense sector, prior to 9 11. And the program that I think really made Aurora, which a lot of people probably don't fully appreciate, was Global Hawk. We bid that as a program to DARPA, or DARO, back in 1994. And the only requirement that they put out was a 10 million unit flyaway price. That was the firm requirement. We took that seriously, and we bid that, and we told them, here's what we think you can do for a 10 million UFP. Bob Mitchell, who is one of the absolute, both aeronautical and management geniuses of our business, who was the president of Teledyne Ryan at the time, built the airplane the Air Force actually wanted. And, of course, they won that., Aurora pivoted quickly and got onto that team as building composite parts, for Bob and his team on the Tier 2 Plus. And then it went from Tier 2 Plus to Global Hawk, from DARPA to the Air Force, from Teledyne Ryan became Northrop then 911 happened and all of a sudden, Global Hawk was a very large program About two weeks before the 911 attacks Aurora put in a bid to Northrop at the time, to build all of the composite parts except the wing, on Global Hawk, and we had won it. And all of a sudden, that was just a huge program. It was very painful, a lot of learning and rapid growth into that, but that was the program that really made Aurora transition from being a, a small, shop that had been pursuing the environmental market into the serious player it became in the aerospace market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And John, how has Boeing benefited from the acquisition of Aurora? What was the rationale behind that? Some would say that one of the reasons that this transaction happened was because Boeing wanted to kill the D8 Double Bubble who compete with the 737. What do you think about that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I, I'm a huge admirer of Dennis Mullenberg, and Dennis did a great interview again on your show, and I think in that interview a lot of Dennis's vision and enthusiasm really came through very clearly in that. And we were part of that. Dennis was out to transform Boeing. He realized that just because you're the best in the game today doesn't mean you will be in 50 years. And our job was part of that portfolio, was to be a disruptive innovation force at Boeing that was looking at generations of airplanes in the future. And, and Dennis, I just think is a terrific, visionary. He was the driver behind the Aurora acquisition. And so Aurora's role was to become an autonomy center, a prototyping center. Boeing had a lot of aspirations. Boeing did not and still does not have a Part 23 division, a division that can do Part 23 airplanes. At various times they've said that's not a market we want to be into, but other times they have been interested in it, so there were a lot of pieces that combined into there. Absolutely true that the D8 was the thing that got that round of the discussions that it led to the acquisition did start with teaming discussions on this NASA, Advanced Concept Demonstrator back in 2016 or so, came out of the NPLUS 3 program and the D8 was a program that had been led by MIT and that Aurora had worked on and was very interested in. But that was, that was a piece of the discussion. Aurora and Boeing had a number of previous programs for a number of different customers, several of them in high altitude, long endurance things where we were both competitors, but also we were, suppliers to them on, on high altitude programs, what the world came to see as Phantom Eye. There were programs before Phantom Eye, but The, Phantom Eye was the one that that became publicly announced and flew. And, you know, Aurora did the wing on Phantom Eye. We did all the engine testing. This was back in 2007/2008. So there was a pretty long history of collaboration working for and with Boeing before the discussions that were kicked off in 2016, that were in fact centered initially around the D8, but broadly they were centered around Dennis's vision of how you built a great aerospace company for the 22nd century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How do think that plan is shaping up?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I don't think it's any secret that Boeing has had some tough times, the Max and COVID were a double whammy. that, that hit them and all the big players particularly hard. I'm impressed. I think Aurora's doing well under Boeing. And I was really pleased at the AIAA SciTech, just a couple of weeks ago here that the DARPA TTO director on stage, publicly commented on how well he thought the Aurora Boeing merger and integration was goIng. Usually we see, big companies buy the little companies and then smother them with bigness. that's in he said, I don't see that happening at Aurora. I see Aurora doing really well and keeping their small company mojo while still doing a good job of reaching deep into the Boeing system for talent and resources. And, I think when your customers are saying that, that's what you want, right? You want it, you're, we're all in business, for our customers. and, I was really pleased to hear that. So I think that's a great testimonial for everybody who's worked hard to make that integration\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the comments you made earlier I'd like to get your further thoughts on. Aurora being great in research and development, but never really building more than one of anything and then to see you move into Electra starting a company that really is very much product focused. What are some of the insights in terms of commercializing technologies that you have learned along the way at Aurora that you internalized as you started to build out Electra.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the company culture is something that is, very difficult to change in, any entity even in small organizations, particularly in large organizations, it's hard to change the culture once it's, locked in. And, you get really good at doing one thing, and you know, Clay Christensen said that your, disabilities are a byproduct of your strengths, right? that what you're good at also defines what, you're not good at. Cause you have all these systems and processes in Aurora's case that are set up to do new things quickly but not to do the same thing, over and not to, support products in the field if from Something at Aurora, I you know I always kind of regretted that. I mean to make a real impact you have to not just invent new things, you have to fuse them into the world where people can use them to make a real impact. And that's what I wanted to do with, Electra. So Electra is not at all competitive with Aurora in terms of company mission.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>John. you've had a lot disciples from Aurora who are in Advanced Air Mobility.

It, the list is like 15 or so. It's amazing. And a number of them have been on your show. So, Brian Yutko, one of the true stars of his generation you who was, what or one of the most rapidly advanced people in the history of Aurora, ran the R&amp; D center in Cambridge, and then was the, head of all the product development. He's now the CEO at Wisk, but Paul Eremenko hired him out the aero department. His first job was on the goldenEye at, at Aurora. He's, had a incredible career at Google and Airbus and, now Universal Hydrogen and, Billy Thalheimer, at Regent, Adam Woodworth, who, was our go to guy for small UAVs at Aurora, until, Google lured him to the West Coast, and now he's the CEO at Wing. it goes on. one of the, one of the bigger ones was Insitu.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let me ask you a quick question. John, if we had Brian and Billy in room right now and you closed the door and said, okay, guys, here are the things you're doing really well and here are a couple of, things you should take a look at.

It's not about burning people down, to build a successful company. It's about, helping everybody reach their full potential. And, we always said that the, you hire on talent. And then you find a role for people in the, business. And I think the string of people who have gone on to start their own businesses or become CEOs of either their own business or a business that somebody else helped start, is something that I'm very proud of and that speaks well to that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Such a universal truth. And, now you're embarking on a similar journey with Electra. When you look that journey, how do see the capital requirements for bringing Electra Aero's first product to market and, into reasonable scale production? How is this going to compare to what an eVTOL project? We all have good examples and familiarity with what those cost. How much capital have you raised so for Electra?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, one thing my mother taught me, you never talk about money in public so I'm not going to give you a straight answer on that question. I will say the total we're looking is based on things like what Pilatus spent to bring the PC 24 into certification. And, Pilatus is one of my favorite companies. I, I think they are just a fantastic example. And, their airplanes are wonderful. And they did the PC 24 for somewhere around 400 million or something like that. And I think that is a reasonable number to bring something in this class range into, certification. That's a 20 percent of what some of these other guys are spending on on this and frankly, I don't know how they have 700 people.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, to get the certification, if you can do it for about 400, I'd say that's, 25 percent of the cost of what these other players are going to take. Maybe 20%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we've lot questions John. Is there else that we haven't talked about you'd like to discuss?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I wanted to just touch on the STEM and, diversity and inclusion element of, industry, which is one of the things that, I am really, passionate about. We touched on it a little bit in that, how you grow leaders and how you help people develop to their potential. But, that starts really young, and I am a huge believer in both the sort of workforce development, which is the pragmatic way to look at STEM, and then the, the sort of, it's the right thing to do, sort of morality angle of STEM, and, I think that is just so the important and foundational to everything all of us in this industry are doing. I grew up in the sixties when Apollo was on the evening news every night, it was the good news story of the 60s and it attracted a whole generation of people into the workforce. Today, we don't have that as much from and we can't take for granted as an industry that people are going to want to just flock to what we're doing. I think we're all made up of total aviation people and, true believers, but we can't just depend on that cadre of folks. We have to be, evangelists in this for, our profession. And, that's part of why I've been very passionate about, programs like FIRST Robotics or like the Team America Rocketry Challenge and why our family has gotten involved with Estes Industries because I see the hobbies like model rocketry as being incredible, STEM development and workforce development, tools.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:09:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Five, ten years from now, how is world different than most people are expressing it? You've heard sounds like just about all of our podcasts, and you're hearing them pontificate on what's going to happen in the next 5 10 years in this world of advanced air mobility. How was your than what you're hearing of our guests?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first, I will caveat that, the reality is I have no idea, right, because, it's really tough to have a crystal ball like that. I tend to think, though, that being a big student of history, that, I look at the VLJ market, I look at the commercial drone market, I lived through the hype and excitement, that surrounded both of those, and if you look at those, you think, well, there'll be few players that emerge in a dominant position there'll be a handful of zombies and there'll be an awful lot of roadkill. I think the big outstanding question for me is whether the eVTOLs are going to end up being the aeronautical version of the Segway. And there was a great article in Wired magazine a few years ago that was titled, well, that didn't work. The Segway is a technological marvel. Too bad it doesn't make any sense. And it, goes back and dissects the, I'll call it the rise and fall of the Segway, which was, an amazing invention by an amazing person. Dean Kamen is truly remarkable. And what he's done in his career, and particularly with FIRST Robotics, I think is nothing short of amazing, but the Segway, was, we weren't going to be walking anymore because we were all going to be on Segways. And, that's not how it played out. So I push those as cautionary tales. And, I guess that's my big question of whether, you're going to see a lot of the eVTOL stuff end up as aeronautical Segways.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What advice would give to our listeners are starting companies with all of your experience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>John:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Agree that it is a remarkable time for innovation and thus for entrepreneurship answer in aerospace I encourage and support that. My, advice would be not to get captivated by chasing unicorns. That the idea that it's how much money you raise, that's the goal, or the metric that's that wrong. I believe that the goal here is to build sustainable, viable businesses. That means they have to have customers and revenue and ultimately earnings. And, I think that's what you've really got to focus on when you build a business is, how am I going to get to, revenues and earnings and not, just, some kind of paper valuation.

I think that a lot of economy of scale pricing for commercial components is on the idea that those really large scale orders come in very few and far between, and I'm not sure that their profit margins are going to hold when they start getting multiple orders at the high end of those economy scales. So I think we may see some pricing innovations come out of the commercial sector. And I think we may also see what I have mentally been referring to is like Kirkland brand options for drone components. Just like you can go to Costco and you can get your Kirkland brand for fill in the blank. I think we may start seeing that in the drone industry as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Kara Kramer, Director of Business Development at AeroVironment. So this is a discussion around the evolving role of UAS in warfare, including in Ukraine. The critical role of the supply chain to ensure we can properly engage in when those wars, and the recent announcement of the U S Replicator Initiative. What it is. Why it happened and what it is intended to achieve. So Kara immediately jumps into the fragility of our UAS supply chain. Something we've talked a lot about over the last couple of years, but she says that with all of the talk and awareness, not much has really been done about it relating to our preparation for UAS in warfare. And speaking of vulnerable supply chains, we discuss how batteries essential to UAS and UAS warfare are often sourced in China. Speaking of vulnerabilities. Then we enter a very cool discussion that the outcome of future wars, as Peter says, may revolve around high volume electronics. And how lethality is coming in, smaller, smaller packages and where the need for secure supply chains becomes perhaps even more important. We discuss the state of the UAS market, particularly defense in UAS and especially around mass. How many drones can you produce and field? How quickly can you scale what's needed to maintain scale? And lastly, how would you rise to meet that demand? Kara discusses, how mass is achieved and how DOD is forecasting orders is the greatest limiting factor and how even large businesses can't invest without effective DOD forecasting requirements. Without the forecast and the requirements that businesses can't and won't justify investments to meet that future demand. And to achieve mass we have to lower the cost and to lower the cost we may have to have an established electronic space and today's BOM or bill material is four to five times higher than equivalent Chinese drones. We discuss the impact of Ukraine on UAS and the impact it's having on our vision of future wars. I really like Luka's question about air superiority. And the role of UAS and that you may never really have air superiority, as long as UAS exists in the battlefield. And we discuss contested logistics, how to get the supplies out to the time and place of need. What a shift from previous conflicts where in future conflicts, like in Ukraine, It's going to be very challenging to have complete air superiority. This is one of my favorite, what I consider to be most relevant parts of the podcast. Then we discuss DOD's Replicator Initiative and what drove its birth, how it surprised industry, how it will leverage unmanned systems to prepare for mass and how it's meant to address the growing threat from China. We discussed the need to move from exquisite group five drones to high volume, high attrition, UAS vehicles. And another great section we discussed startups, listen to what Kara says are their advantages and what she said should be the focus areas for startups. And a really interesting section around counter UAS, the market size, the lack of a real leader and the real demand. Finally listen to what Kara sees as the future of warfare and her advice to you our entrepreneurs. Kara, thank you for joining us for an impressive discussion and to our listeners enjoy our conversation with Kara Kramer as you innovate in The Vertical Space.

I think about the fact that all of our edge computing comes from one single foundry in Taiwan, all of our NVIDIA chips, and that we, as we're thinking about preparing for the next great power conflict, we haven't thought enough about diversifying away from that, the one, there's one specific boundary in Taiwan. So that's, I think one thing people don't agree with me on is that fixation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Has it changed at all in the last couple of years, based on the reality of the supply chain\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think COVID woke folks up to how fragile the supply chain can actually be. It was even something as simple as consumers not being able to get toilet paper. I think it was an eye opening experience for folks when they start thinking about supply chains for critical weapon systems that have one, maybe two provider of a part that it will not operate without. I think COVID 19 made it real. But what I haven't seen is, I've seen a lot of discussions around how we're going to make it better, but I haven't seen a whole lot of action on it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When did you begin to form that view and what keyed you into it first?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what actually keyed me into it is it was back when I was at a company called Thomson Reuters. so Thomson Reuters is a Canadian data company. they own Reuters News and a whole bunch of other Data sources, you probably have no idea, roll up under them. While I was there, I was doing some work for, the defense department looking at supply chains for GPUs, graphical processing units, and that's when I first realized how many just critical components for weapons systems were coming out of TSMC, which is a foundry in Taiwan. And you'd see fluctuations in the GPU market caused by video game popularity. And then you'd see cryptocurrency would rise, and then that would put a strain on GPUs as well. And then folks in the military could not get what they needed because of a really popular video game. And that's when I started to really realize how fragile this could be and what a risk this is creating for us, especially as we're looking at the future of warfare that is largely focused on that exact geographic region.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Yes. And what you bring up, really pulls forward some historical lessons in modern warfare. If we look back over the last century, take World War II as an example, like many modern wars, it was ultimately decided by the strength of the respective industrial bases in the countries that were fighting and the U. S. had, I think an advantage going in with the automotive industry that it had already built and the mass production capacity that was throughout the supply chain in the U. S. And if what we're looking at here in this, next iteration of warfare is that the aspects of the industrial base that will be decisive are around, let's call it high volume electronics and the semiconductors that drive them. Then, I don't think that the U. S. has anything resembling leadership in that, I think that a lot of that capacity has, over the last 30 years, really developed in Asia. And so for us to, change that as a country and our industrial base, it's not something that we can just say, hey, we need this and a year later, it shows up. Would you agree with that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, I would absolutely agree with that. And especially with the rising demand for what folks are calling attritable assets in the battlefield.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's only going to put more pressure on the supply chain when you can't cannibalize old systems for parts to keep the new systems in the fight. How will the supply chain keep up with that? How can you price that to be a attritable when there's one specific semiconductor on there that just, you can't get right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think we're seeing, lethality show up in smaller and smaller packages in modern warfare and what we're learning from the conflict in Ukraine, and we're seeing, looking ahead, more and more automation being built into weapon systems and certainly the Chinese are developing, what you might call truly autonomous weapon systems. But to whatever degree that you decide to imbue that automation into these systems, it gives anyone the opportunity to really scale it out and have very high volumes of systems on the battlefield. And just the numerical scale of it can be an overwhelming and decisive factor. If that's the way things play out in the future, then, from our standpoint, where are we going to develop the capacity in the manufacturing base to deliver that scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Kara you're not saying that people necessarily disagree with you on this point, before you answer Peter's question. It's more, people may not be as aware of the vulnerability of the supply chain. And it directly relates to, military use of drones, for example, as Peter's referring to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. Because it's one of those pieces that folks look at, they look at the drone and they think of that as a commercial part that goes in there as something you can go on your computer and you can order, it just comes. in the mail for you. It's not something you're going to consider, like a critical component until you can't get it or until the price skyrockets because there's such a shortage in what's available. And what we were talking about with the autonomy piece and trying to push autonomy out en masse, our policy dictates that we need to have a human in the loop for anything that's going to be regarding lethality. Which means for a human to be in the loop there needs to be a video feed so they can make that determination. And that video feed is going to require edge processing of some kind. And that's where you're going to hit that, you're going to hit that roadblock every time. But my other truly controversial, people don't agree with me on this, I think that our policy around the human in the loop limitation will only last as far as, the first few days of a peer adversary conflict.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interesting. play that scenario out for us, Kara, will you?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, based on what you can read in the news, you have a pretty good idea that our adversaries are not limited by the same policies around your AI and your lethality decisions. And so you're talking about meeting a peer or near peer adversary out in mass when they're not limited by the same restriction. And you're talking about fielding thousands of autonomous systems at once in swarms? And you need to keep a human in the loop for every single decision that involves a kinetic effect. It just, it's hard to imagine how that's going to scale well, and how we're going to remain committed to that policy, as we engage in, or hopefully never engage in a conflict like that. But if we were to, I don't think it would happen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If it's in the opening days of the war, where there's only one side in a certain direction you can have a, quote, kill box and instruct the autonomous systems to engage whatever is past a certain boundary, but once the troops start mixing, then this becomes a lot more complicated scenario to, work through.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I agree completely. It becomes almost dystopian to think about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the supply chain fragility topic, besides the video links, what other specific UAS components do you think are most impacted?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Probably batteries. So I've been in the UAS industry for not as long as most people, but for a while. And one of the hardest pieces to source that doesn't touch China is batteries. And when, especially when you're talking about small, attritable UAS, they're going to be operating off batteries to be likely sourced from China. So as soon as that would be shut off, that would be problematic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let's zoom out a little bit and just, share your perspectives on the market. Describe the state of the UAS market today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure, I'd be happy to. So most of my statements are going to be focused more on that defense part of the market, not commercial. So the biggest focus of the market that I'm seeing right now is around mass, is how many can you produce, how quickly can you field that, and a lot of that's driven by the conflicts overseas. So Ukraine is a huge demand signal for systems. It's also a proving ground for new technology, and it's been, a time where you can see innovation happening in real time in a way that we haven't had that ability to do so. And then you're also seeing. You're seeing people, like, the situation in Israel and Gaza, you're seeing our allies going through their reserves, and you're seeing how quickly that can happen. So you're feeling, in the industry, you're feeling a lot of that demand of how quickly could you scale, what would be required to maintain that scale, and some, almost like an excitement, but also a little bit of trepidation around how you would rise to meet that demand. Also seeing a lot of, push towards the smaller systems that have a higher level of endurance. That's a challenge for both physics and power, but that's been a kind of, a rising trend in the drone industry. It's almost as popular now, in my vision, than the eVTOL space that you've seen with the Air force's Agility Prime and all the providers around that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the topic of mass, how do you think this is achieved? Where do you see the limiting factor? Is it in the, parts as we discussed just moments ago, or is it in manufacturing processes to accommodate that level of low cost and production at scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in my viewpoint, it boils down to forecasting orders. That's the biggest limfac for the industry rising to meet the challenge of mass is that there's a lot of discussion around how we will achieve mass, what kind of manufacturing facilities we need it. But the truth is that's well within America's wheelhouse to rise to meet that challenge. But even large businesses can't invest in the facilities and start to manufacture at that scale until they have at least a few years of forecasted orders coming in from the government that would allow them to make that investment. And so that creates a catch 22 where, the government may not be ready to put in those orders because what would they do with that mass if they didn't need it and that industry can't prepare at risk because they don't have any certainty on it, and they either have to answer to their investors and their board, or they have to answer to their shareholders about how they're managing that fiduciary responsibility. But it also means we will be in a situation where we'll likely have to try to scale really quickly when the time does need it, unless the government invests in it ahead of time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, in your mind, for a country to deliver that type of mass, how important or helpful is it, for that country to already have a domestic consumer electronics industry that is enabling high volume production, of related types of products. Is that really a requirement in order to be able to turn and have the industrial base deliver high volumes of these types of systems?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>17:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In my opinion, yes, absolutely, because to, to achieve mass, you have to lower the cost. And a big part of lowering the cost is using as many commercially available parts as possible in your system. And those commercially available parts have to be available to you. You can't have a six month lead time for the electronics that are going to go into your system. Because those lead times build upon themselves. And all of a sudden you have this attritable mass that will be available in the next 12 to 36 months, which potentially is not as helpful as we'd like.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what do you see as the state of the consumer electronics industrial base in the U. S. and, how far away is it from, being able to support the type of demand in the military space that we're looking at?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know that I would call myself an expert on the consumer electronics industry, domestically, I will say that, generally speaking, in my experience, you end up having to seek out the best performance for the dollar in order to meet your obligation to the government, as well as to the taxpayer. And that, generally speaking, isn't always going to be domestic. Unless there's a regulation that's blocking you and forcing you to go domestic, you will be, in general, trading off performance to stay domestic. And so I think until that gap is closed and the domestic electronics perform the same way, it's going to be, it's going to be a limfac for us.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>19:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I've heard, anecdotal accounts of, people who are doing systems integration, to build domestically sourced drone platforms. And they've related to me that to build something with equivalent capability to a Chinese drone, the bill of materials is four to five times more than what that Chinese drone costs. And so if we were to think about domestically building up an industrial base that had the depth and that therefore could be cost competitive, is there a way to do it that bypasses already having a consumer electronics manufacturing base in the country? Is there a way to do it as you talk about, working with allied partners or building that capacity in another fashion?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My theory is that we'd likely have to work with allied partners to get to the point where we would be anywhere close to the cost of Chinese made parts. I mean, there's a reason why you're not buying an iPhone made in California. You wouldn't like that price, and it may not work the same way your previous iPhones did, and even if you could achieve the same performance the price is going to be well past what you would consider reasonable to spend. So, if you have a system, a UAS system, that is completely NDA compliant, meets all the blue list and green list requirements, it's not going to cost anywhere close to your DJI type equivalent, even if the performance is equivalent. And that is the price that the government has to pay right now, and it is one of the, it's one of the stumbling blocks for achieving mass, is that, we've set up a situation where even hundreds of millions of dollars isn't going to get you the same mass that a hundred millions of dollars for another country would.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And, numerically, what do you think of in terms of, being mass? Is it a thousand? Is it 10, 000? Is it a million? and looking at, Ukraine perhaps as an example that gives us some kind of bedrock off of which to think about this, what do you see as the level of mass in these systems that is going to deliver, an advantage on the battlefield?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I love that question. How would I define mass is right up there with how I would define attritable. It's going to depend, largely, and there is no definition that everyone's going to agree to. I think for what we're generally speaking about mass would be in the hundreds. We don't have any systems that I'm aware of that we could do in the thousands or ten thousands, or at least it wouldn't come from, one provider because of the cost would just be really prohibitive to do that. And in Ukraine, you're able to achieve mass with hundreds, but you're also facing a high degree of attrition. Which is to be expected in a conflict. And so part of, the math is just keeping the water at the same line as when you started, even if there's a leak at the bottom of the cup.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>22:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Kara, one of your earlier comments where you were saying that there's difficulty in forecasting demand. I mean, even in light of the kinds of attrition that we're hearing is happening in Ukraine and how little, arsenal the West, especially in Europe, seems to be having right now. Even in light of that, there is, you're saying, uncertainty or unwillingness to forecast demand with some certainty.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>22:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. There absolutely is that. Because there is uncertainty around the continuity of the funding being an even flow. So, in order to be prepared to build a stockpile, that would be an investment the government has to make. Companies themselves generally do not stockpile systems at all. They're just going to have exactly as much as what's ordered and any spares associated. They're not going to have anything extra that would be laying around unless the government instructed them to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, we're just coming off a podcast talking about eVTOLs with Dr. Manning and Dr. Bourdain, and we've been talking about autonomy with eVTOLs and AAM. Set the stage for us a little bit of what's driving the demand for mass what's happening with Ukraine that is different than we saw a year ago, let's say. And then second, how is this translating what's going on with Gaza right now?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I love that question, and I would say that from my viewpoint, what's driving the demand for mass is actually coming out of the Indo Pacom area more than anything. that's where that drive is coming from. Indo Pacom is going to be your Asia Pacific region of the world, and that region is defined by this, what is affectionately called a tyranny of distance. Meaning you aren't going to be able to have a central base, you're not going to be able to quickly resupply, you're not going to have runways necessarily, and there is just going to be a significant amount of inescapable maritime factors in whatever you have going on. So a lot of that focus on mass is looking at that tyranny of distance and imagining that you're across this great, vast expanse and you're also in an area where you maybe do not have traditional communication means available to you, the navigation would be limited, but you still need to conduct operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Given that we have the problems we have today in meeting the demand, were we anticipating this a year or two ago? Has Ukraine changed our view at all? Has what's gone in Gaza changed? Or is it still an Asian focus and Ukraine has had little impact?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>25:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think Ukraine's been hugely impactful for understanding how important unmanned systems will be in the current and the coming conflicts. I've heard folks refer to Ukraine as the drone war, where it's the first war where we're having drones versus drones happening in the battlefield. We saw lots of drone operations happening in Afghanistan and Iraq, but it was normally just we were using drones, and we weren't seeing folks using them against us in the same way we are in Ukraine. In Ukraine, you're seeing Russia using loitering, munitions. You're seeing Ukrainians use loitering, munitions, and you're seeing that signal jamming going back and forth and then the Ukrainians are having to adapt on the fly to, to be able to still operate and keep their assets in the air.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>25:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's been the biggest lesson learned from the war in Ukraine and how drones are used there for you personally, Kara?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the biggest lessons learned. It's probably the importance of having more drone operators in these militaries is that Ukraine has done a great job on ramping up on having their training catch up. But that's been one of the things that they've had to catch up on is having enough people who can operate the drones because the U. S. can drop off a Connex box full of them. But if they don't know how to operate it, then it's not going to be useful to them. So I think having that training tail be ahead of conflicts is probably one of the biggest lessons learned.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the types of drones that the Ukrainians have had the most success with or that are in the most numerous use on the part of the Ukrainians?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know that I can answer that definitively. I think most of it is going to be in that sensitive information category. to plug AeroEnvironment, I would say that they've been having a lot of luck using the Switchblades in the engagements. It's one of the unmanned systems that you're going to see referred to often in publications. And that's because the loitering munitions are pretty ideal for this type of conflict because they can stay up in the air for up to 25 minutes. And then they have that kinetic impact as well that it's providing, like, close air support without needing actual close air support in the battlefield.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One thing that the war in Ukraine highlighted from the get go is the need for air superiority which has been absent and therefore resulted in the kind of trench warfare that we're seeing. Now, it seems like that concept is extending to the realm of drones as well. So it seems like going forward, especially in these kinds of operational scenarios, there's no true air superiority if you also cannot protect the skies from drones. So how do you think air superiority will be achieved in a world where a few hundred dollar drones can be sent up, en masse, and disrupt, lines, make everything visible. There's no safe haven anymore. You can't maneuver with the kinds of vehicles that you're used to maneuvering because you'll be picked up very easily by a surveillance drone that's just, saturating the front lines. How does air superiority get achieved in a world that looks like that?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think air superiority is going to end up looking almost like an arms race between UAS and counter UAS. Meaning, I think that you're going to see a prevalence of unmanned systems making a real impact in a conflict, and then you're going to see a meteoric rise of a specific counter UAS technology that is then neutralizing that. And then you're going to see the UAS innovation catch up and figure out a way to operate around that. So you're going to see a ping pong back and forth between counter UAS, and UAS, capabilities. I don't think you'll ever achieve full air dominance in the battlefield as long as there are unmanned systems. There's always going to be one, that's either, smaller, flies lower, flies higher, you fill in the blank. They're always going to get some through. It's more going to be about trying to achieve dominance versus, like, absolute conquest.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Peter today, sent us an article by Ian Lovett from the Wall Street Journal that talked about the impact of drones on even logistics, as you were, mentioning Kara. I mean, it's amazing to think that the, the combatants in Ukraine can't even be bringing forward supplies in the vehicles they traditionally brought them forward with because of the use of drones. And they can pick up on the different vehicles and the, I mean, you talk about air superiority, the impact that drones has even on the supply chain and the devastating effect it can be if you don't have a secure supply chain or logistical tail, that's amazing, what are your perspectives on that? Are you surprised by it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, I'm not surprised at all. In the DoD, it's commonly just referred to as contested logistics, right? And that's a huge pain point. It's how are you going to get the supplies out to the time and place of need. Because we can't send the warfighter out and think that we can't resupply them. And the thought of not being able to do that, I think is a paradigm shift for our military. In our past conflicts, we've not had points in time traditionally, there's always going to be exceptions. We haven't had points in time where we can't get supplies out to the warfighter. And we're preparing for a conflict where it may be very challenging to do that. And we may have to use alternative methods for it. And that's where another use case for UAS is providing contested logistics of having an unmanned system bring forward MREs, bring forward water, bring forward ammunition to a place that we can't get a vehicle or a manned aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because the combatant drone knocked out your supply chains.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exactly. And having an unmanned system do contested logistics means that if it went down, all you're losing are the supplies on it. You're not losing any human life. So that's going to be, I think, really critical in future fights.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What this points me towards is, in this game of one upmanship between UAS and counter UAS, it seems that mass itself can play a big role at each iteration of that game, where, someone will choose to counter the other system by simply producing, huge scale numbers of their system. And especially as we move towards systems that have less and less human involvement. the ability to do that scale up becomes even more and more feasible. So, it points towards an inevitability, number one, of moving humans out of the loop in these systems. whether people are comfortable with it or not. One side or the other is going to go in that direction. And it also points towards something decisive in the battle being a high volume production capability to produce things throughout the war effort and not just prior to the war. Because as we're observing, these are really rapidly evolving technologies. They change throughout the conflict and thus they don't have a really long shelf life. So it really points towards cheap, high scale, immediate production capability as one of the ingredients going into this conflict that it helps either side play this type of a game.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that cheap, quick aspect of it, I think, is a challenge for our military. Because when you think cheap and good, you're going to have a really hard time finding something that's NDA compliant. Because that's going to push you more towards the drones you can buy at Walmart, right? But there's always going to be American innovation. They don't all have to be small aerial systems. We've seen some really exciting innovations coming out of the Navy's Task Force 59, where they want to run demos on a shoestring budget. And they're just using a commercial boat and they just modified it to be unmanned, an unmanned surface vessel. You have even older drones that are fielded program of records that's just a software update to push those to be fully autonomous. So we aren't limited by new purchases only. And everything doesn't have to be the quintessential small quadcopter, I think a lot of it's going to involve thinking about something from a different angle to get to that true mass that we're looking for.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It really does require new thinking because it is, in some ways at odds with the ways that we've developed and procured military hardware in recent decades, where we've opted for more lethal, more expensive systems that we perhaps possess in fewer numbers than the previous generation. And other types of munitions we've been able to stockpile over long periods of time. For instance, 155 millimeter shells, you can stockpile those for 30 years and still employ them with effectiveness in the battlefield. But if the munitions, if the expendable high scale items that you bring into the conflict have this degree of intelligence and behavior built into them, they have a shorter shelf life. And so those two factors are both changing as we look at, the lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, and as we look ahead to a future conflict. It's really bringing home the deep implications of this for what we emphasize in future procurement.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And, the Boneyard in Davies Monthan comes to mind as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For repurposing some of that. Kara, what are you hearing from defense customers? What are things that they care about the most? You mentioned the Switchblade, but can you peel that onion a couple layers and talk about the specific capabilities? Is it the robustness to jamming? Is it GPS denied navigation? Is it autonomous features?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>35:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in true DoD fashion, it's going to be, they want all of it. That's generally what I hear from the customers is they want something that has a long endurance. It can go up in the air for a while. They want something that has crystal clear ISR. They want something that can operate in a GPS denied or contested environment. And they want it really cheap. That's generally what they want. But you get to pick just a few of those characteristics. I'm also seeing a demand for things that can be passively placed as well. So systems that don't need to be handled as often and they can be, left in place for use later. I'm also seeing a demand for systems that operate off a common ground control station. And so instead of a warfighter having to have multiple apps in order to control systems, it's being able to have a more single, point of contact for controlling systems. And when you start thinking, everyone loves the word swarm. When you start thinking about swarms, it's how on earth would a single operator control multiple systems, especially if they all come from different providers, which likely they should. That's likely because you want folks that are really good at what they do. You don't want one company making every single drone on the battlefield. So we need those to all be able to work together in a single interface that the warfighter can interact with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are you talking about the, I don't know what the acronym is, RAC2 or SCI initiatives in the Army, or is it something else that you're referring to?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's just broader in the idea that even if you took it away from the DoD and you looked at something like Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol, they're using well over 10 different providers for drones at the border. And so those have to have a commonality for use, because you can't have every single officer be trained on every single type of drone, and the interface can't be completely different. So just a broader, interoperability versus a specific initiative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Kara, how do you see the status of the counter UAS capabilities in the battlefield? And what is the source for the massive attrition that we're seeing in Ukraine?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the status of the counter UAS is that we need more soldier borne options is that we can't have counter UAS that's tied to a specific location. And I think we're not seeing attrition solely from counter UAS in Ukraine. I think we're also seeing it through your other options like system failure or kinetics from the counterparts are taking them down, but for counter UAS, I think that the market's going to see a really intense focus on pushing innovation in that area, and that innovation is going to probably not get a break from that push for a while because they're going to need to keep pace with what's coming out of the UAS market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you see UAS as having the edge over counter UAS currently?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I do. I do because I think a lot of counter UAS has been focused on a small, very small drone swarm. They haven't been focusing on larger drones as often that I've seen, unless it's just not available out in the news. And so there aren't going to be as many things they can take down from a counter UAS standpoint that are going to take down like a Group 3. You're going to have to resort back to traditional military means of taking down an aircraft, which is likely going to require a cost that's multitudes higher than the cost of that airframe. And we're seeing that in Ukraine as well, where Russia's putting up systems that are, really cheap, probably wouldn't even fly five more missions after that, but it costs 50, 000 to bring it down. Because there isn't going to be a counter UAS method to bring them down, other than ammunition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If Ukraine is losing 10, 000 drones a month, how is it losing them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's going to be losing a lot of them either from counter UAS, from the adversary, or it's gonna be losing them. So one of the things that they count in that are gonna be things like loitering munitions are gonna count, but that loss is actually very intentional. It's not meant to come back. So anything that's a kamikaze drone, that will be counted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If a lot of the demand is coming from the military use of drones, where the path to market is a lot quicker, what do you think is the impact on the commercial market. And specifically here I'm thinking about creating these attritable systems with components that don't require the kind of robustness that you would want to see in a drone that's used in a commercial, use case. So if most industry resources are funneled into a world where you don't need that level of robustness, what's the impact on the commercial technology development?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So assuming that the regulatory environment catches up, it should lower the barrier to entry for commercial customers to get into UAS to replace things that they're using, maybe, even like manned systems for right now. Things like agricultural use cases, where you need a low cost way to crop dust, but you need to crop dust once a year. There probably isn't any reason that you would need a really high level system to do that. So, having the defense lead the innovation, and push industry to innovate around that attritable mass will likely make it easier for commercial customers to enter into the UAS market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right, Kara, so let's talk about the Replicator initiative. Can you describe for the audience what we know about it? What information is still missing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Replicator caught most folks, I think it's safe to say everybody, off guard when the Deputy Secretary of Defense Hicks announced it in early August, and she announced it to the press that we were going to do this initiative. And that's where she introduced the name Replicator, that was going to leverage unmanned systems to bring mass and prepare for upcoming conflicts. After that press release, there's been just a lot of confusion in industry around what does this mean exactly? What's going to be their acquisition method for doing this? Is there going to be an RFP? Where is that going to come out of? And what we know today is that a lot of the coordination for industry and government is coming through the Defense Innovation Unit or DIU, and that we have moved to the point where we believe that there's going to be tranches for Replicator. And we know that tranche one is what they're focused on first, but beyond that, we've had nothing really official from the government providing firm guidance to industry on what to expect coming forward. I think the number one thing folks aren't sure about is where the money is coming from. We know that Hicks has said that this isn't a new program. So Replicator is not a new program of record. It's an initiative. Also not clear is whether or not it's accelerating current and funded ongoing efforts by the DoD or if it's starting new. So this is one of those times where there's a lot of information trading happening in industry. There's a lot of engagement with the government and trying to put the puzzle pieces together on what this means so that we can be in a position to meet the demand if and when it comes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, tell our audience if you could just, what drove the need for Replicator and really what is it, why did, secretary Hicks feel it was so important?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Replicator is about bringing this mass into the environment. And I know that sounds really high level, but we're talking about all domain attributable autonomous systems, which has a confusing acronym. If you're familiar with other DoD acronyms like A2AD, this is ADA2, that all domain attributable autonomous systems. They've been fairly forthright saying that the reason for Replicator is to meet the growing threat of China. And that's been the motivation around it. What we've learned since then is that we aren't just talking about unmanned systems that are in the air. We're talking about unmanned surface vessels. We're talking about unmanned underwater vessels. So we're going to be covering down on all of those domains.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned tranches. What do we know about the plan to roll out the tranches, and what's Tranche One?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we know that the tranches were something that the government, they had an internal committee, and they reached out to the services and to the combatant commands and asked for recommendations on what should be included in that first tranche. We know that those recommendations were then given, We believe that they've done a vote on that. Hicks released press towards the end of last week saying that she's made her decisions and she's going to be presenting them to Congress. So, our best guess is that she'll do that in the next week or two, and then after she gets congressional approval on that plan for Tranche 1 that it will be announced and communication with industry will happen then. There hasn't been any commercial solutions openings or RFPs. There have been a few RFIs, which are requests for information and it's not binding that have come out related to Replicator, but we haven't seen anything related to tranche one come out through official government channels. It's actually all been coming through the press. The\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's the chatter in the industry?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Chatter in the industry is mostly focused on trying to figure out who's on the list for Tranche One to be honest, and trying to figure out how much funding they're planning on. They're planning on doing what's called reprogramming funds. So that would be potentially tied to the 24 budget. So there's a lot of what I like to call business development math going around trying to figure out Tranch One. So figuring out, hey, is my company on the list? Does it say what thing that we make is on that list? Great. So we know they're going to reprogram funds and we know that the 24 budget will likely hit on x date which means the money would be available on y date so that we can inform our leadership on what our next steps are going to be. And that's what every company who is anywhere close to being on Tranche One is doing right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And are we correct to understand that most of the companies that will be on Tranche 1 are, companies that are on an existing program of record with DoD?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'd actually, nobody knows for sure. The idea is that they're all currently engaged with the DoD. They may not be engaged in a program of record though. So I think it would be unlikely that it's going to be any companies that are not currently doing business with the Department of Defense. But I haven't heard anything that's going to limit it to current program of record.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you are a betting person, who are the top five firms that you're would say are gonna be part of the program?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would say, Aeroenvironment, Anduril and then I would have to Google some unmanned surface vessel and unmanned undersea vessel company names, because I don't even know there're any.

And is it all Group 1 and Group 2 vehicles? Is there any intuition about the kinds of capabilities or the types of vehicles, at least in the air domain?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think in the air domain, that focus is going to be on, just to go back to that all domain, attritable autonomy. So what's going to be able to be autonomous in that all domain. And when I think all domain, I'm really thinking about back to that Pacific theater. So what's going to work when GPS doesn't, what's going to work when you're in the water, what's going to work when it's been days and you haven't been activated yet. So there haven't been any formal requirements for Replicator released to industry. So a lot of it's going to be around the press that was released and some of the industry events that have happened. The DIU is going to do a Replicator industry summit either this month or next, they haven't announced it yet. At that point, the hope is that some of those requirements will be released to industry. What we've been told is that Tranche 1 is going to be a way for them to experiment and learn on how Replicator should be. Because in the name itself, there should be a process that is able to be replicated. We aren't just producing systems for the sake of it. We've done that before. that's not too innovative. This is more about the DoD itself having a process that it can replicate on how it can step outside of its traditional acquisition boundaries and achieve mass when needed and creating that replicated process they can pass on as needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We talked earlier about the industry's lack of certainty about forecasting demand and therefore investing in manufacturing and technology. Has Replicator changed that a little bit or to what extent has it, how has the industry responded back in August versus in the months that followed?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I have seen some press from some drone startups saying that they're opening new manufacturing facilities to be better positioned for Replicator. But for most of the industry, we're in a wait and see. We need to get the requirements. We need to get the timing. And we need to get the actual order from the government that's what we need to be prepared. But that's just basic economics, right? Where any company isn't going to produce more of something until they're sure that it's been ordered.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interesting. I mean, just looking at the macro. Situation and the direction that the world is headed towards. it does look like it'll be increased instability. And the need for production capability and fielding of these autonomous attritable systems is only going to grow in importance. So, I get the argument of not investing without firm orders, but there's a balance to that. At some point you have to be investing so that you stay relevant and so that you stay ahead of this wave that you can respond to in short notice. How do the major players in the industry think about this balance? How do you think about it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that balance is one of those checkpoints that at an established industry, you're checking in constantly on the forecast. You're checking in on how things are looking month to month. Because you want to be able to ramp up manufacturing, but you also have to maintain quality. So you're balancing a lot of factors when you're looking at it. And most of the established defense industrial base, they are manufacturing at a fairly high level already. They are pushing out what's needed. And it is always the question of, well, what if that quadrupled? What would you do then? And the answer is, new manufacturing facilities, hiring additional people, and all of that takes time, especially when you're talking about manufacturing things like munitions. You can't just, throw that together in a couple weeks and get it going. There's a lot of regulations and certifications that need to happen before that can get going. I think that it's possible we may see some government investment in the manufacturing capability for weapon systems from the government, similar to the, CHIPS Act that came out. But if you look at the CHIPS Act, it takes a lot of time for that to flow down to the industry as well. So I think it's one of those we need to just prepare for.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You said the defense industrial complex is supplying at the demanded rate so far, or say that again so I make sure I have that right. And my question that's tied to it is, how do you think about that in the context of the current order backlogs for existing missile systems, which we're reading about in the press right now? But please say that again.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I think the defense industrial base in general is producing at the quantity as required by their contracts. So a lot of that demand signal is going to come from their contractual requirements. Things like lead times, they're usually built into the expectations in their contract, and so Peter, you brought up missile system delays, there will be times where they're going to be untenable delays and delivery. And the more complex the system you're delivering, the more likely you're probably going to hit some of those. But for your smaller group one UAS, you're likely not going to hit those kind of delays. And so those are going to be able to be produced relatively easily, as needed, depending on that demand signal and contractual requirements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you think that there's a logical conclusion that comes out of this? That, some of the future systems that get designed, the people designing them will put certain constraints on it that avoid very complex handbuilt components or exotic materials that, by avoiding those, would allow them to ramp production rapidly in the event of a big change in demand due to a conflict. Is that something that's being discussed that's being pursued as a theory now or not?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think I see that trend in industry. I'm seeing the trend to move away from the exquisite. But I'm not seeing that demand signal in government solicitation documents. And that's really where it ultimately needs to come from. Because if the exquisite one off system is what wins, that's what industry will, create. Because there's going to be payoffs for using commercially available parts. And those payoffs will likely come in performance. And so the end user has to accept that, where if you want something, let's say you need a solar powered high altitude drone, if you're willing to accept that solar, high altitude drone has commercial solar panels that were not, designed and engineered for that drone, what you're likely doing is you have less payload. Or you've had to change the design in a way to account for the commercial solar panels. So if the end users and the customers, if they accept those trade offs, you're going to see even more of it in industry because it's what makes sense. And it's what allows us to have shorter lead times. There's nobody in U.S. industry who wants to tell a customer that it's going to take 180 days to send you what you ordered.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>54:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, that ability to rapidly ramp up production might become one of the requirements of the system design.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. But I think even more so than saying rapidly ramp up production, because you're always going to have companies that are going to put their finger in the air and say, well, what about additive manufacturing to create my exquisite part that I developed for this one particular air system? You actually will likely need to see a more explicit emphasis on using commercially sourced parts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara what do you think is the advantage of startups in this environment, especially with respect to those kinds of entities being more long term looking in terms of capital allocation and planning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think startups have a huge role to play in this because startups bring a couple advantages. The first being focus. A good startup is focused on a particular subset of a problem, and large companies, they're never going to be focused on one small piece of anything. They're focused on a whole family of systems, a family of products. So startups can bring that focus, but they're also going to bring investment, which gives them freedom to experiment. And you're going to get a lot of innovation from that, that is going to bring advantage to this challenge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>56:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if you had an audience of innovators, well, actually, you do have an audience of innovators, you said, listen, this is a great environment for startups. And these are the three things I would focus on. What would they be?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>56:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So the three things I would focus on if I was in a startup right now would be Underwater Unmanned Vehicles, Surface Unmanned Vehicles, and whatever is the next generation of counter UAS. There's a huge proliferation of companies that do USVs and UUVs. In my viewpoint, and maybe folks can send me emails and tell me I'm wrong later, which I'd love to hear, there isn't a clear leader. There's no Anduril or Palantir of USVs at this point. And there needs to be one. There needs to be that company that's not just pushing the envelope, but leading the pack. And for counter UAS, you have some of the larger defense startups like Epirus that have a really exciting product. But, like all good startups, they've been really focused on one subsection of it, and there's a lot of space left that needs that American startup innovation concentrated focus.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And that's a pretty good size industry. If I remember correctly, it's today, maybe a couple billion, but it's supposed to go to 10 plus billion in the next couple of years. So it's a good size, realizable market for a startup to get involved with. And you're saying it's not a crowded space, counter UAS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it is, but I think there's not a lot of sticky in that space. Because if you had to name a company that is in counter UAS, I would challenge you to name one off the top of your head that wasn't Epirus so I think that there's a lot of room left to rise above the level that folks are at now, and proving out maybe a different way of thinking about counter UAS.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think there have been a lot of attempts in Counter UAS, but the results have been, middling.

Back to the Replicator, why do you think the announcement was done in a way that it was, with such levels of ambiguity?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I can tell you that, my joke is that it's the whole thing is a psychological operation, either against our own defense industrial base or against the Chinese. We're all going to spend a lot of calories trying to figure out what's going on. But it was probably something as simple as, sometimes in bureaucracies, the only way to get something done is to say it publicly. And so it may be a way of making innovation happen is by forcing it by telling the press we're going to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a very interesting theory. So if it was the former, what is it about the existing military industrial base that needs to be shaken up?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>59:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think shaking up on the idea of a low cost system is that an announcement like Replicator makes even the most established large businesses think about, how can I make it cheaper? Let's go back to the CAD designs. Let's really think through what can we drop? What can we modify? How cheap could we make this? Because they want to be ready to talk to the government about how they could meet the mission. And so it is a forcing mechanism where, in general, you are not trying to think about how to rip out everything out of your system to make it as cheap as possible is not a common thought exercise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if that is the end goal, and especially if this is the end goal for the 18 to 24 month timeframe as initially communicated, what's on the critical path to achieving this in terms of technology or processes or anything else for that matter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In all honesty, the biggest piece on the critical path is gonna be clear announcements and communication with industry so that industry can start working to meet the intent of what we're doing with the Tranche One of Replicator. And then also clarity on what the Tranche Two and Tranche Three however high those numbers go. It's what's the vision there? Because sometimes if it's something that's going to maybe push the envelope further than we're doing right now, R&amp; D doesn't happen overnight. And industry has the capacity to invest in it, but you need a heads up, you need to be that trusted mission partner and sit shoulder to shoulder with the government and see what they're trying to achieve, what's the overall concept of operations that we're doing here, and that's going to be the critical path. The more that's shown to industry, the more that we'll be prepared to meet the challenge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so let's say that, the industry day for the Replicator happens this month and there is clarity in the volumes and let's say the DoD decides that we want to be able to manufacture in 24 months from now, tens of thousands of group one and group two UAS systems. Is that realistic? What is the realistic path of achieving that goal look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I don't know if tens of thousands is realistic, but hundreds or even low thousands is absolutely realistic. And once that's clear, the individual industry partners will make a plan and start working to make sure that either investments need to be made, a reprioritization of resources needs to happen. And we'll all start marching towards the goal of being able to do that. I think right now, when we're in that ambiguity and haze of not being entirely sure, I think this is probably the hardest part. This phase, I think, is going to be harder than actually delivering on the goals. Because we aren't able to do anything with the amount of information we have right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So do you see a need for innovation and entirely new technology development that needs to be executed on in order to be able to ramp up to these levels? And I'm thinking novel manufacturing processes, cheaper infrastructure, or perhaps, certain elements of the supply chain of the industrial base that requires new R&amp; D, new technology development, or is it a matter of just having a line of sight to capital and scaling whatever existing technology?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think innovation is absolutely going to be required for the later tranches. What we've heard about Tranche One is that it's going to be about systems that are already in production, or are about to be in production. So the anticipation there isn't that we'll need to change anything about what we're making. It's more about being ready to make more of them. But for the later tranches, innovation is absolutely, I think, going to be required. And even for the current first tranche, there's a lot of room for innovation around how things are manufactured, how supply chains work, and how supply chains are also managed. Because a big part of being able to supply mass is also maintaining mass. And so we'll need to look to innovation to be able to do that better than, is currently done.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's your intuition about tranche 2? What will that look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My intuition is that it will likely focus on what I like to refer to as enablers. So when you, when you start thinking through having, let's say 3000 drones, then you start to wonder, okay, I just delivered these to fill in the blank Army customer. Now, how are they going to actually employ that mass? How are they going to, train for it? How are they going to do the command and control for it when they're actually using it? And a lot of those are going to come from what I call enablers. And so you're going to see things that are less attritable, but maybe still autonomous that work in concert with the mass to enable the mission to actually happen. That's my gut for Tranche 2. It may be a later Tranche than that. And I also think, contested logistics is going to be a focus of one of the Tranches as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, yeah. Before we wrap up with the podcast, I wanted to ask a quick question. I mean, at the end of the day, a lot of innovation comes on the commercial side because of defense spending. Let's say we implement Replicator in the next year or so. What major change on the commercial side will occur because of Replicator?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the major change we're going to see is probably a rethinking of economy of scale pricing from our commercial partners. I think that a lot of economy of scale pricing for commercial components is on the idea that those really large scale orders come in very few and far between, and I'm not sure that their profit margins are going to hold when they start getting multiple orders at the high end of those economy scales. So I think we may see some pricing innovations come out of the commercial sector. And I think we may also see what I have mentally been referring to is like Kirkland brand options for drone components. Just like you can go to Costco and you can get your Kirkland brand for fill in the blank. I think we may start seeing that in the drone industry as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, arguably it'll drive prices down. The US commercial drone companies, will they be negatively affected by this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that until those Kirkland brand options are available, there may be some scarcity in the market, or there may be a difficulty at meeting your price objective given to you by the government. But eventually, where there is demand there's gonna be market\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Arguably at a lower price because of the\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>for the volume\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>driving down costs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in line with that, do you see the evolution of some kind of mil spec drones being designed and then bid out to different manufacturers to produce at scale?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think that's the only way you would be able to achieve the kind of mass we're talking about and then sustain it. If you weren't able to have large manufacturing plants or gigafactories that were producing drones at scale for multiple providers, It's hard to imagine how you're gonna meet that demand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's interesting.

I mean, is it going to be some of the big commercial drone companies? OEMs?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think it will be with the big commercial drone OEMs, and I think it's gonna be some of the defense tech startups as well. I think you may see some eventual consolidation there as maybe some new start startups come up through the Replicator program as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara what is the most difficult and important question that the UAS industry needs to answer?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most important and the most difficult or either or.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Either or.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the question is simple.

And we're looking at this proliferation of options available that will be at a much different price point than what we've seen and able to operate with a higher degree of autonomy than we've seen in the past. And I think for Counter UAS, we'll see a rise in optionality in that market for how we can counter these systems and secure key places like our bases in forward locations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:09:19\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about even longer term, 10 years?

I say slippery slope like it's a bad thing. The idea of having warfare be just about who has the most money on resources and not actually hurting people. It's actually doesn't sound like the worst thing to me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, that's the inevitability of it that I referenced earlier.

We talked about the state of the UAS market with a specific focus on defense and then how drones are being used in the ongoing war in Ukraine. We talked about the Replicator program. What do you see as some of the most common misconceptions when it comes to this industry?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Kara:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think one of the common misconceptions, and I definitely fall into this trap myself, is forgetting that other countries have good drones too. And that it's not an area where we have pure dominance. Ukraine has definitely shown us that there are systems that are coming out of other countries that are performing really well on the battlefield and are giving Ukraine an edge and they're cheaper and they have a great deal of capability. So I think one of the things that's important to keep in mind is that we aren't the only game out there for this and that's a good thing to keep in mind because it keeps you sharp and it keeps you focused on making our capabilities even better.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Great point.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kara, I gotta tell you, I am so impressed with how you've handled these questions and you get to the point, you're brief, and you're so knowledgeable.

You triggered me. It really irks me when people use that expression because I think, well, for what purpose? Why are you collecting data? What system is this that you have where enough data on its functioning makes a safety argument? I'm not comfortable with a system where people say, well because it worked for several thousand hours or because we did so many auto landings with it, it's safe. That's just bogus. That's not the way these processes work. That's how you get to 10 to the minus two, maybe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey everyone. Welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Robert Rose co-founder and CEO of Reliable Robotics. Listen, few have Robert's pedigree to create systems for autonomous aircraft with his work and leadership at Reliable Robotics, as well as from his position as Director of Flight Software at Space X and at Tesla, where they worked on bringing to market the first consumer automobile with fully unassisted self-driving capability. This is a conversation about autonomy. We discussed the arc of automation and what evolved in the conversation, the arc of safety in aviation from its early days to today. You'll notice how Robert will closely and consistently link autonomy to safety in the beginning, throughout and at the end of the conversation; an irrefutable argument. He essentially says autonomy is going to happen so get used to it. But he makes the hard medicine taste just a bit better by tying the key arguments to safety. We spend a bit of time on the motivation for pursuing autonomous flight by segment GA part 1 35, 1 21 with a safety imperative with automation being more required in the former than in the latter. After a few attempts, we eventually get to other reasons why autonomy is needed in addition to, and beyond the safety case. As we've discussed many times the podcasts, we discussed the need for autonomy for many of the advanced air mobility business models to scale, and to meet their financial projections. Robert discusses the autonomous capabilities of Reliable Robotics, and as Robert says, what makes them unique is their ground up designs for automation and certification, where it's more difficult for others to go back and design for automation if that wasn't the original intention. We spent a lot of time discussing the processes required to certify automation systems. And you'll notice that we make every attempt to quantify the addressable market for autonomy and for Reliable Robotics at each of its stages today and in the future. Robert deftly steers the path to the size of the overall aviation market. We try to stay focused on the addressable market in the next five years and what opportunities within Reliable Robotics are tied exclusively to the Caravan and how easy it is to transition the capabilities to other aircraft. Next is a really interesting discussion around the design of their air to air radar it's value, market size, and why build it on their own versus purchasing off the shelf radar and whether or not it's core to their autonomy focus or perhaps a distraction to that focus. This naturally leads to a discussion around their airspace integration solution, including capabilities from their own radar and integrating data from other sources and the dependency on those solutions. And a discussion around the availability and value of primary radar data, where some would say, including me, it's availability is a lot further away than most people think especially given justifiably how long it took to release secondary radar data to industry. Listen to what Robert says is his biggest upcoming challenges if he had to pick one. He wraps up his talk with great advice to entrepreneurs. Robert, thanks for joining us and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Robert Rose as you innovate in The Vertical Space. Robert's deep engineering experience spans over 20 years across aerospace, self-driving cars and robotics. Prior to co-founding Reliable Robotics, in his role as Director of Flight Software at SpaceX, Robert was responsible for flight, ground, simulation and data management software successfully launching and operating the first 10 Falcon 9 rockets, 5 Dragon spacecraft, and Grasshopper VT VL tests. He led the development of the onboards flight software for their first commercial mission to the international space station, for which he received special recognition from NASA. At Tesla, Robert brought to market the first consumer automobile with fully unassisted self-driving capability. He led the team through developing novel computer vision, human machine interfaces and control technologies resulting in the successful deployment of the autopilot 1.0 and the 7.0 version of Tesla's instrument panel. At Google X, Robert led a development team on a secret project combining AI techniques with practical robotic systems to bring advanced machine perception and manipulation technologies to large vehicles. Earlier in his career, Robert contributed to three\"Game of the Year\" award winning titles during his time at Sony PlayStation and worked at HP as a software engineer. Robert is a presidentially invited Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Robert holds multiple patents, a BS in Computer Science, a BS in Computer Engineering and an MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Oregon State University. Robert, welcome to The Vertical Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, great to be here. Thank you for having me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First question, is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So there's a couple of different ways I could take this. I could take this, the, are you asking, Robert the individual or Robert the company? let me take the, company perspective. we started Reliable Robotics because we felt that somebody needed to cut a different path from everybody else in, in the UAM, AAM, RAM, new aviation space. We felt very strongly that somebody needed to focus specifically on autonomy and autonomy in the United States, because at the time, and I think this is still true today, I still hear from folks, people say, well, well, this is never going to happen. We're never going to have autonomous aircraft or this is never going to happen in the United States. It's going to happen in Dubai or New Zealand or Brazil or someplace like that first. Or people say, well, nobody, even if we have autonomy, nobody's going to buy it. Customers aren't going to want it. Pilots will never allow it. Passengers will never accept it. And I feel that a lot of these criticisms are still true to some extent today, or at least many people still hold these, and bring up these criticisms. We obviously, I obviously feel quite different. I believe this will happen. It will happen very soon. It will happen in the United States. I believe there is a path to bring this technology forward that, pilots and other stakeholders in aviation will accept. And we can talk more about that later. And I think ultimately we'll get to a place where passengers are going to accept it. this is the future. I think the near future is going to have orders of magnitude more aircraft in the sky, and the way that we get there is with greater levels of autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>when you say it's here, it's going to happen. and people are going to accept it. So what level of automation are you describing when you say it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm referring to automated aircraft that enable you to take the pilot out of the plane and into a control center, place them into a control center. This requires an aircraft that's capable of fully automated taxi, takeoff, and landing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Now you mentioned, you have, you had a professional response to those who, don't always agree with you on something. And then you said you had a personal as well. So what's the personal?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I want aviation to be safer. I'm a pilot and I think there's a lot of people that get into aviation because they have that love of, grabbing the controls and, they are the airplane, be the airplane. And there's a part of me that I get that, I understand the appeal. I think, unlike many that get into aviation, I also appreciate it for what it enables you to do and where it enables you to go. And I value the where you can go with aviation more than the experience of aviation, if that makes any sense. And for me, I want more automation in the cockpit. to ensure my safety, the safety of my family and others that I take in the plane with me. I've had several occasions in my limited experience flying where I've gotten myself into trouble and I wish there was a land now button in the aircraft. I think there should be a land now button in all airplanes. not just a system that's certified for emergency use only, but a normal use Autoland gets you back into a safe configuration and on the ground. and we have aspects of this today in airplanes. we've got wings levelers and emergency autoland and autopilots that can do heading changes and capture an approach and do all of that, but I don't think that goes far enough. I think there's a lot more that we can do to make aircraft safer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, before we get into, the meat of the discussion, you used the word safety now, 15 times in a couple of minutes,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>two or three, exactly two or three\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you for noticing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>two or three years ago, would safety have been mentioned as much as the use case for automation or what was your value proposition a couple of years ago for automation and fully autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:16\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I feel like we've been consistent on this from the beginning. Now, I think the larger conversation this industry has been having has been shifting. And I think that's because folks or others are recognizing that, the way you get the FAA and larger customers excited about this technology is you do that through safety by improving safety. I don't know if that answers your question. is that what you're getting at?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, there's a piece of me that says, well, you can't argue with safety. although I question whether people will pay for safety, you can't argue with safety. But yes, the many people listening right now will think, oh, we're going to talk about automation, we're going to talk about fully autonomous flight, we're going to talk about the economic value, we're going to talk about pilotless flights, which is extraordinarily controversial. But in some ways, you've steered a path here that is not controversial. Who can argue with safety? And you're saying that's a deliberate act for a variety of reasons.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>11:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, if you look at what stakeholders in the aviation industry care about, safety is the first thing that they talk about. If you look at, well just step back and look at the history of technology advancements we've had in airplanes over the last a hundred plus years. why has anything in an aircraft changed? It's changed to make the airplane safer. Like that's not an accident. I actually would be interested in knowing about improvements that were made strictly for economic reasons. Okay, maybe winglets come to mind. But most technologies, or at least electronic, avionic technologies, are there to prevent accidents and save lives. Period. And I think autonomy fits within that same trajectory. Autonomy or autonomous aircraft. It is just, it is an incremental set of enhancements on top of the incremental enhancements we've been making over the last several decades. I don't see the advanced navigation system that we're developing a whole lot different than what has been done in previous years with GPS, ILS, and other radio navigation systems, and even going all the way back to light beacon navigation systems. these are all technology enhancements to help improve safety. the automated landing system that we developed, I think, fits within that same trajectory of, automated landing systems and automated approach systems that have been developed to date. Our automated take off system, which is really a take off rejection system, fits largely within what's been happening in the industry for, for decades on automated monitoring of aircraft configuration during take off and take off rejection systems, And finally, automated taxiing, I see that, as a bit more new and novel, but from a core technology standpoint, really just builds on systems that are already going into aircraft. and even now, it's, our automated taxi system, I would say, builds on taxi planning features that you have in an EFB now, and it's just taking that one tiny step further, to ultimately improve the safety of you, the pilot, the occupants of the aircraft, and the people that operate around that aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm sure a lot in our audience all have, pretty good familiarity with aviation history and the milestones that were achieved over the last century. But from your perspective and from the perspective of what you're building at Reliable, What are the key milestones along that arc in terms of putting in place the building blocks and setting the precedence for autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, we, and you're referring here specifically to the history of aviation. what are key milestones throughout the last century?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>13:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, Full Authority Digital Engine Control. Huge. I think we need FADECs in every plane. I think it's ridiculous that small aircraft, expect you to sit there and manage mixture and, prop speed and all of those other components. it, it should just be, fully automatic. At the very least, we should have auto throttles in every plane. Instrument landing system goes back to the 40s. I believe the first experiments were in the 40s with automated landing systems, and then that technology was further developed in the 50s, and then commercialized first in the 60s. I think it was the, I think it was the Trident, I think it was British Airways, I could be wrong, that first deployed that technology, and that drove, developments in fault tolerant computing, I think, is something we take for granted because the space race was occurring around the same time, but the first real commercialization of a fault tolerant computing system was an Autoland system. This goes back to the 60s. NASA in the 70s built, I can't recall the acronym, I just remember that it wasn't the best choice for an acronym, but they built a, oh, it was the Terminally Configured Aircraft Program. they built a flight management system that allowed you to specify a flight path through all phases of flight, takeoff, enroute, and all the way to landing. And they actually flew this, it was on a Boeing aircraft. I can't recall exactly which model. GPS also stands out as another huge safety benefit. switching from, ILS approaches, which require expensive, infrastructure to be installed at the airport and then maintained. By the way, the FAA has a small army of pilots that just do nothing but fly around the country to monitor approaches and to make sure all the radio signals are correct. Moving away from that and towards a satellite constellation system has gone a long way to improve safety because it's enabled so many more airports to have RNAV approaches. That's huge! Think about all the accidents that we had before from people messing up approaches and going visual before they should have, or scud running. a lot of that has gone away. It's gone a huge way to improve safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>let's stay on the history of flight. Talk about the arc of automation and aviation from the early days.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we go all the way back to the Sperry autopilot, would be the start of it. I believe those tests were done first in the 30s, and then instrument landing system, as I mentioned, fault tolerant computing associated with that developed in the 60s. I think other key moments, key inflection points would be, Automated descent systems that monitor depressurization events, and then will bring an aircraft back down, to a safe altitude. I don't want to get too dark, but there have been some accidents recently where if that technology had been in those Private aircraft, it would have saved lives, but it does exist in a few large, commercial aircraft. there's a GA Avionics manufacturer that, promotes this as a product. I don't know off the top of my head how many aircraft have actually adopted this system, but, That, I think, is huge. for us, that's very significant because, automated descent following a depressurization event, you've got there a system that at very high integrity is monitoring for an adverse condition or an anomalous condition in the aircraft. And without asking the pilot, it's taking over the plane and putting the plane into a safe configuration. It's descending down to a safe altitude to save the lives of everybody that's on board the aircraft. And we talk about, that as like a key inflection point internally, because that's a time when you've got, an automated system taking over from a human, and in a split second manner, acting to take control of the aircraft. and you can't find a straight line between that technology and the regulations. the closest regulation being 91. 3, the pilot is the ultimate authority for the safe operation of the aircraft. here you've got the automation taking that responsibility, and that's significant precedence for us. and a lot of the system that we're developing now leverages on that precedence, or builds upon that precedence, I should say.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, as we pursue, autonomous flight. Let's talk about the motivation for, this goal and let's do it on a segment by segment basis. So describe for each of the, part 121 operations or 135 or general aviation or UAS systems for that matter. Why do each of those segments really care about fully autonomous flight?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, so GA, 121, 135, and then you had UAS, which I assume you're referring to small UAS\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>correct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>okay, sub 55 pounds. The Box Droppers, as we affectionately call them. GA, I think, has a clear need to improve safety. there's this myth that is commonly propagated that aviation is the safest mode of transportation. And that's true for certain 121 operations. That's definitely not true for GA. And there's a couple of papers that were published in the last several years that dug into the data here and concluded that, flying small aircraft, and this is GA, and certain 135 operations is actually 8 to 15 times more dangerous than driving on a per mile basis. I found this shocking. my intuition was planes are probably not safer than driving smaller planes. I didn't know it was this much worse. and so there, the motivation is to improve safety. That then ties to a very clear economic or business imperative. if you talk to almost any small airplane manufacturer, they will tell you that the biggest impediment to them selling more aircraft is the significant other. I don't want you getting in that thing, or I'm not getting in that thing with you. And systems like, parachutes and whatnot have gone a long way to alleviate some of those concerns, but not all of them. My strong belief is higher levels of automation are going to improve safety and thus expand general aviation to even more people, which I think is very exciting. I know my significant other, my wife, would be very excited about this and much more comfortable flying with me if she knew that we had a land now button.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I agree. General aviation does have a much more pronounced safety problem, but what about part 121 operations and 135?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll take 135 next. I'll take these in, in order from smallest to biggest. So in 135 operations, you also have a safety imperative. Here you've got, aircraft that are frequently operated single pilot, frequently operated at lower altitudes in, More adverse weather conditions than what you would see in 121 operations. And the nature of the work, tends to be a little bit less, What's the word I'm looking for? A little bit less structured than what in 1 2 1 operations. safety management systems, for example, are not required of all 1 3 5 operations. They should be, but they're not. small 135 operations don't have the FAA requirement. certain operators impose. They voluntarily adopt SMS. I think that's great. more operations should do that. But there, I don't want to get dark again and start citing specific accidents, but if you Google around, 135 accidents, especially 135 cargo accidents, you'll see some very unfortunate events where, People have gotten themselves into some pretty sticky situations that could have been prevented with automation. so there's a safety imperative there. The business, motivation in 135 is a bit different. I'm going to say pilot shortage. that shouldn't be shocking to anybody, but the pilot shortage in the 121 realm is trickling down to the 135 realm, and it is vacuuming up pilots out of 135 operations at a very fast rate. I hear from operators quite frequently that turnover is extremely high. it's getting harder to recruit and retain people. Salaries are skyrocketing. And on top of all of this, because of the accidents we were talking about earlier, insurance and training and other factors are all becoming more expensive, so it's becoming harder to find people to run these operations. For some operators that I've spoken with, it's existential. They say that they may not be able to run their operation in the near future because of pilots, and so they need to look at automation. they need to look at ways they can, Get more people, trained up, which you can do with improved levels of automation, or move to remote piloting as our technology is moving. so finally, in the 121 realm, you've got some different dynamics. pilot shortage is definitely a topic of conversation, but, I think safety, it's not talked about that much publicly, but Congress has been bringing it up as of late. we've had a few incidents that have occurred at major U. S. airports that made headlines that could have been prevented with certified alerting and guidance and higher levels of automation. And I think the industry needs that to be able to keep operations efficiently flowing and to maintain public confidence in the aviation system. I don't think you can draw a straight line between pilot shortage and automation. I'm not ready to go there. I think some folks in the industry are trying to draw a straight line, but I think it's going to be several more years before, the pilot shortage is a direct driver of automation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>23:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>can you go a layer deeper, either in the Part 135 safety cases that you reference or Part 121, and give the audience some examples of a dangerous situation that occurred and the cause of it and how automation would have prevented it because obviously in aviation there are many different causes that lead to an accident. Some of them can be weather related, some of them can be, a failure of some part of the aircraft, or it can be a failure of communications. help us connect the dots between how automation specifically would alleviate certain types of accidents.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, I'll have to go back further because I I don't like to talk about recent accidents until the NTSB has completed their reports. I don't think it's appropriate to draw conclusions. but there was an accident about, a year ago involving, a Caravan pilot where, this hits pretty close to home for us, where they were attempting a, a landing, at an airport in northwestern United States, and the weather was pretty close to minimums, and they came down, broke out, and, were not able to make contact with, the runway, or they didn't break out, they weren't able to make contact with the runway, visual contact, they performed a go around, and it appears from the preliminary reports that I've read that, They decided then to descend, believing they understood the airport environment, broke out, and then, ran into some fixed infrastructure on the ground. And, this breaks my heart because, there's just no reason they needed to die. If they'd had a system that enabled, Zero Visibility Autoland, if they had a high precision navigation system that gave them a glide slope and localizer that they could track, then they could have shot this all the way down to the ground through the clouds and missed that fixed infrastructure. Some have speculated that it was a poorly designed, approach procedure, and the runway and that fixed infrastructure never should have allowed an automated approach, but, there's ways to do it. could have had a slightly higher glide slope, and we could have given this person something that would have saved their life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>as tragic as it is, it's not a case for adopting a remotely controlled aircraft though, right? How do you draw a line from that to remote control of aircraft as being the answer, as opposed to other safety enhancing, tools and systems on the aircraft from, navigation, better situational awareness, et cetera.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:25\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the first system that we're developing is a fully automated aircraft that still has a pilot on board. our first step is not remote piloting. our first step is give the people in the cockpit, more sophisticated tools to prevent them from getting in those situations. And that does lead eventually to remote piloting, but there's a lot of other technologies that have to be added to the aircraft in order to enable remote piloting, such as air to air radar and more robust, communication systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you talk to your customers, part 135 mostly, I assume, do they admit that they have a safety problem? Is that what the business case revolves around?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's a substantial component, and for the reasons I mentioned earlier, there's, it comes first from a genuine desire to not put people at, a higher level of risk than necessary. If we can do something to prevent accidents and save lives, then damn it, that's what we need to do. and the customers that we talk to, the customers we spend a lot of time with, that's what they say. This is about saving lives. Having said that, there are other benefits that come along with it, once you move to remote piloting. I mentioned earlier, training, training becomes much simpler, much more straightforward. being able to reposition aircraft becomes much more straightforward. Being able to up gauge and down gauge the aircraft, flying aircraft that is appropriate for the mission or right sized for the mission is another benefit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>tell us how your concept for remote operations, how that is fundamentally different to how the military is operating its MQ 1s, MQ 9s, or for that matter the QF aircraft series.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>our system is more like Global Hawk than the old Predator system. we don't have a joystick. there's no rudder pedals. there's no live stream video feed that lets you hand fly the plane down to the ground. our system Works, very much like an FMS, because it is an FMS that we've modified, and in fact, the first system that we're certifying, the system with the pilot in the plane, they're programming the aircraft through our flight management system. It's a slightly more, sophisticated flight plan than what you would do today. Today, you would go into a plane and you would program your enroute portion. maybe you would program your departure procedure and your approach procedure. But if you did those things, there would be potentially discontinuities in your flight path. And maybe your FMS will alert you to those discontinuities. A few systems actually do that. Many will just be happy to let you fly off, out over the ocean and never actually intersect your approach. And then while flying, air traffic control, and for other reasons, you may need to change altitudes, you may need to change headings, and that deviation from the flight plan is not managed by your FMS. So our FMS manages all of that for you, so you don't need to ever Disconnect the autopilot and hand fly the aircraft, we do it all. And we do that at a level of safety that far exceeds autopilots today. So our system on the ground now uses that exact same FMS. you're programming the aircraft, just like you would if you were in the plane using our system. What else is new? You also have a Traffic awareness, feature that's built in. So on top of our moving map, we plot traffic and our system provides certified or will one day be certified, today it's certifiable alerting and guidance, that maintains safe separation from other aircraft and will modify your flight plan for you. it also enables, voice communication to the aircraft. So there's a headset connected to our system and it works just like it does today. You dial in the frequency that you want to talk on. There's a push to talk button and your voice is streamed over satellite to the aircraft and then broadcast out the aircraft. So surrounding air traffic control, they hear you. Just the same way they would if you were sitting inside the plane. And conversely, you also hear everything just as if you were inside the plane. So we did it this way because, we're trying to do the simplest thing possible that can integrate into the existing airspace system. And I emphasize this because there's Folks out there that talk about, digitization of air traffic control, I think that's exciting. We're part of an RTCA group that's working on that, but I think that's a very long ways away. today The airspace works through charts, sectionals, AFDs, and people talking to people over amplitude modulated VHF. And so if you want to integrate UAS, that's the way you've got to do it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Robert, given that there's so much experience across the General Atomics platforms, the Northrop Grumman's and some of the others. if there was a solid business case in the commercial market, Wouldn't you expect those same players to service part 135 operators?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know how much of this is public. so I'll speak in generalities, but major military drone manufacturer you've heard of, I know, has attempted to market, the system to commercial players and has attempted to push, their aircraft through an FAA certification process. And I, I think the short story there is, it's hard. it is really hard to take something that was not designed with certification in mind and modify it to be certifiable. the Certification process, and not just the certification process, but the set of standards that the FAA has recognized, that should be used for certification, take your systems engineering all the way back to requirements. and if you don't have the evidence going all the way back to the very, very early days, mapping the requirements for your system and why everything is exactly the way it is and precisely how you have tested everything to ensure that it meets those requirements, it's hard to go back and do that after the fact, and for those that are listening that are familiar with DO 178 software, there's common stories in there about how you can't just take something from a prototype and then snap your fingers and make it certifiable software. It just doesn't work that way. So it's hard for these military manufacturers to make that transition. millions of flight hours does not a certification case make. You need to be able to hit factors of safety in the 10 to the minus 8, 10 to the minus 9 realm. That means the acceptable failure rate is, depending upon the size of aircraft, one in a hundred million hours of flight, or one in a billion hours of flight. You can't fly a plane for a billion hours and say, well, we only had one accident, therefore, it's certifiable. I'm not smart enough, but there's a RAND paper that goes into this too, that says that even a billion hours isn't sufficient to show one in a billion. You got to go way beyond that in order to get any kind of statistical\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:18\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right, right. I guess where I'm going, Robert, is when we look at the Enabling technology blocks that exist on these platforms. And there's been some recent examples where, one of these big OEMs, have integrated into civilian airspace in the UK, they do have a certifiable platform. So what's different in your system approach? On a fundamental technology block that stands in contrast to the approaches that you're seeing by these and other players,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so you used a phrase there, fundamental technology block. And maybe I'll disappoint your listeners a little bit that I don't feel there's anything fundamentally different about what Reliable Robotics is doing from a technology perspective. What we're doing that's very different is our systems engineering approach. We are looking at this from day one with certification in mind, which means a thorough understanding of the regulatory construct for Highly automated aircraft and charting a path through the regulations, through existing published guidance by the FAA. Well, by the FAA, I was going to say and others, but we are nearly exclusively focused on the United States and building a system that complies with That set of regulations and guidance from day one. I think that's what makes us different. And when you approach it from that perspective, it leads you to make different technology decisions. for example, our air to air radar is not a military target tracking radar that consumes a tremendous amount of power, takes up a bunch of space and costs I don't know how much to manufacture. It's going to cost a lot less. it's going to meet exactly the requirements the FAA has, Published that they will accept for air to air radar for detect and avoid, through TSO C 211, 212, I believe, and nothing more. and that's going to result in a system that complies with those requirements right out of the gate and is probably an order of magnitude or more, less expensive than the systems that have been developed for military applications. I would also say the same on our communication system, our ground control station. Human factors is probably the biggest area in the FAA certification process where subjectivity creeps in, and that's where there are fewer standards to leverage, and what you really ultimately need to do is convince a number of subject matter experts in the FAA that the system does not Impose an undue burden on the pilot, and is consistent with human factors best practices, which change year to year, month to month, day to day. And that, that also needs to be designed from day one with a civilian aviation use case in mind. and that's where it's probably not a custom user interface that's point and click. it probably looks a lot more like the user interfaces that the FAA has accepted to date. and that's why our, design decisions track more towards a classic FMS and not something completely new.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:39\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so whenever somebody makes a safety argument, the bar is really high, obviously. So how can, anyone pursuing autonomous flight Reliable Robotics included, make a convincing case that what you are developing is safe in every conceivable condition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>36:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, this just goes back to what we were just talking about. The way you show a system is safe is you follow the published guidance, that the FAA and EASA have long accepted. There are standards. There are system engineering process standards that have been around for many years that are used to develop the Boeings, the Airbuses, the Embraers, the Part 25 aircraft of the world. And the way that you convince the FAA and thus the public that it is safe as you follow those same processes. I fundamentally disagree with folks that say because it's autonomous, because it's new, we need to invent new processes. That's completely bogus. We have processes to do this. It's just, it's a very hard, it's an arduous path. That's how you do it. That's how you get to 10 to the minus 8, 10 to the minus 9 and beyond.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we talked about the fact that, the military systems have not been able to prove it after millions and millions of flight hours. What's your view on the path to getting there? In terms of, data collection, time, whatever metric that you are using to track your progress along that way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>38:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The metric that we use to track progress is how many regulations have we demonstrated compliance to so far? And there's processes for each. this is how certification works. You map out the regulations. you establish a certification basis, that says these are the regulations that are appropriate. You establish a means of compliance, an MOC. Fancy word, but just means how are you going to show that you meet the requirements. the, and then within each of that, there are processes. collect data, collecting data is a trigger phrase for me. You triggered me, it really irks me when people use that expression because I think, well, for what purpose? why are you collecting data? what system is this that you have where enough data on its functioning makes a safety argument? I'm not comfortable with a system where people say, well, because it worked for several thousand hours or because we did so many auto landings with it, it's safe. That's just bogus. That's not the way these processes work. That's how you get to 10 to the minus two. maybe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>obviously data is important. Obviously showing a track record is important when you talk to the regulator. how do you then view this challenge of proving to the regulator that in the absence of data\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>no, there is, I'm sorry. The collecting data is a trigger word for me because people talk about throwing their Autonomous plane up in the sky and building hours on it and collecting data so that they can further improve and modify the system. and then they, there's a double speak there where they often tie that to certification as if the FAA is going to say, Oh, you've flown 10, 000 hours, it must be safe. Okay, go for it. That's just irrelevant because it matters what it. You need to understand, like, well, what conditions did you operate the system in? did you just burn holes in the sky endlessly for 10, 000 hours? what were you really doing? I, we could take our plane and go burn holes in the sky over Mojave and perfectly clear weather with no other air traffic for 10, 000 hours, but what did we prove? Nothing. but\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it's configuration management. It is the right data logging. It's the right data management. obviously, it has to be structured in a way that resonates with the certification processes and all of the other applicable regulations. Absolutely. But, that's table stakes And so once that is understood, Talk about the development process, where you get comfortable and you get the regulators comfortable that you have achieved a certain, maturity level where you can field this to an aircraft and have confidence that whatever conditions they might encounter, the system will work and be safer than when the pilot is on board.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>40:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll go back and explain the certification process. There are hundreds of regulations that impact what we're doing. and each regulation has, Congress passes laws, FAA creates regulations that are, in compliance with those laws. The FAA then publishes guidance. on how they expect applicants, like us, developers of aircraft systems, to comply with those regulations. So within that, they publish guidance on, I'm trying to think of an example. regulation. says that automated landing systems need to be certified. and then they publish, an advisory circular that says, here's how we, the FAA, believe you need to demonstrate that you meet the regulation for an auto land system. And that, that one line regulation or paragraph may expand into a 700 page document. That 700 page document may reference other advisory circulars. It may reference industry standards. Maybe RTCA has published some guidance on how to tune a radio system that uses radio navigation for the purposes of auto landing and what the performance requirements of that system should be. This all expands out into thousands and thousands of pages. We actually summed all of this up, recently. we're well over, I think it's 27, 000 pages of documents, that we've brought into our system that are all FAA standards and publications and guidance that the FAA has put forward and blessed as applicable for Complying with the regulations. And these are just the ones that impact our system. There's actually much, much more in aviation more broadly. And so you have to dig into each of these standards and pieces of guidance that the FAA has published to get answers to questions like, well, how many hours is enough? Or how many flights is enough? How many landings is enough? In the vast majority of these cases, our certification approval that we received earlier this year, maps to about, I would say, 90 95% ish to things the FAA has already put out there. The stuff that doesn't match is dealt with in issue papers, and there, we've either proposed our own standards. We've said, hey, if we were you, FAA, this is the standard. And we just made it up. This is what we think the standard should be for this type of system. And we've gone back and forth with the FAA. It's taken many years, but we've gotten them to agree that's a reasonable standard for this thing. And now that's the standard that we're going to follow. In other cases, we've taken existing standards and we've proposed tailoring them. We've said, for example, the auto landing standard for Part 25 aircraft has a lot of really good stuff in it, and we're just going to leverage that, most of it, 98 percent of it, for Part 23. There's a few areas that we don't think are applicable to Part 23. Don't ask me off the top of my head what they are. we got the FAA to agree to that. Okay, so now you get into, let's take Autoland for example, I don't know the numbers off the top of my head, but the Autoland set of standards, and this is hundreds of pages of documents that explain this, state that for you to get an automated landing system certified, you first have to build a very high fidelity simulation of your aircraft, and you have to show in simulation that the aircraft can hit essentially all possible, foreseeable, combinations of environmental conditions and aircraft configurations within whatever envelope you are intending to certify. So if we say that our system is good to 15 knots crosswind, then we need to show that for all density altitudes, and for all crosswinds, plus or minus 15, and all weight and balance configurations, and all aircraft configurations, and all possible, internal system failures that the aircraft could be experiencing, it will always bring the plane down to the ground within our performance window X feet laterally, Y feet, longitudinally, et cetera, and we're never going to exceed the G load limits of the aircraft. then you take the simulation, then you, from that, you say, okay, well, how do we verify that the simulation matches reality? And you have to choose test points in the real world that give you confidence that the sim is representative of the real aircraft. So you may want to pick the worst case aft CG configuration at the worst case density altitude at the worst case crosswind component, and then you have to go find a place in the United States to go do this. And that's why you go out to a place like Casper, Wyoming or whatever, and you stay out there for a couple of weeks until you hit that test point. And then you hit all your test points and say, okay, boom. Now, the simulation is good. We comply with all the Autoland requirements.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in developing autonomous systems, you can broadly bucket into data, algorithm development, and testing, which one of those three do you see as the most challenging?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Say that again, algorithm development and what?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>45:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>broadly data, and in that it might be data collection, data annotation, warehousing management, so broadly the data bucket, then it's the algorithm development, and then it's the testing validation and verification. So if we can high level those three categories, where is your biggest focus now? what's the long pole in the tent? and where does a startup have an advantage over an incumbent?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>can I see what's behind door number four? I, I think, I wouldn't pick either of these. I would go to the certification basis, I think is the biggest challenge. And that's the area where a startup like us can have the biggest positive impact. And that's why we started the company. I don't think, I don't think collecting data is, a huge technical challenge. that's solvable. Algorithms, while complicated, are just algorithms, and that's just work. and the testing is just work. It just, it's something that you just have to do. the really hard part, the most challenging task in all of this is to figure out how the autonomy maps specifically to the regulations,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>while we're on the topic of Algos, can you talk about the software that's behind your autonomous features?

We're going through those exact same processes here. The difference is, we just don't have the pilot inside the aircraft to act as part of the system, if that makes sense. And it's hard. it's a lot more work when you don't have the human in the cockpit as the final node in your fault tree, to save the day and you don't get to defer the problem to training, then that means you need to implement an algorithm to, to solve it. And if we can imagine it, then we need to implement code or some feature of the system to mitigate that hazard. If you can imagine a hazard, we need to mitigate it. Period. That's how it works. Or we need to convince ourselves that it's like extremely improbable, like beyond 10 to the minus nine.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>48:56\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>a lot of these, situations you cannot imagine ahead of time.

Can you give us a little bit more detail about your cert plans?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we don't intend to get in that situation. I am not surprised that their request was denied. there's a reason we have the certification process in the United States.

Our system is an STC that goes on top of the existing aircraft that's already type certificated, modifies it to enable remote piloting, and then the Part 135 air carrier certificate and the operation specifications associated with it need to be modified to support the STC. Much like today, if you have a 135 and you want to I don't know, fly CAT 2 ILS approaches, you have to write that into your OPS spec. You need to demonstrate to the FAA that you have sufficient training procedures to, teach your pilots how to run a CAT 2. they'll be the same kind of thing with our system where if you want to run our STC in your operation, you're going to have to write that into the OPS spec and you're going to have to coordinate with the FAA and get permission to do that. So for those of you unfamiliar with how airlines work, certifying an airline is just as complicated, if not more complicated, than certification of the on board equipment, the aircraft itself. the FAA gets very deep into how an airline runs itself, and the procedures that airlines use. There's a few obvious things like, pilot training that they get very deep into, because all airlines have chief pilots and chief pilots are responsible for, ensuring that everyone is sufficiently trained and there's standards that they need to follow. Safety management systems is another aspect that the FAA gets very deep into, and how, airline operators build and maintain safety culture is a big part of that. Maintenance is another obvious feature that the FAA gets very deep into.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right. Hey, Robert. so let's take a breath and let's go in a different direction here. Great discussion. How big is your addressable market today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, are we talking about today right now? Because I don't have a product yet. I don't have a certified\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>you had a product today. How big is the addressable market?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>51:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, our system is designed to be aircraft agnostic. And our intent is to take this STC, that we're first working on in the Caravan, and then modify it so that it can be put onto other aircraft. It'll be somewhat straightforward to do this for other Part 23 aircraft, a bit more complicated to do it for Part 25. But if we're including, Part 25, in your question, then the addressable market is huge. It's basically all of aviation. aviation is close to a, what, a trillion dollar industry now, drives four and a half percent ish of global GDP. and we think that we'll be able to access a very large portion of that. I should say to our business model, because I think this is important. is not just to provide the equipment. We don't want this to be a one time sale, but we're also providing all of the training and infrastructure necessary to install, deploy, maintain, and operate the autonomy as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are people willing to pay for today? And why? By market. And how much of it is safety driven? And if it's not safety driven, what's the key value proposition?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's safety driven. We were talking about that earlier.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Even 135 and 121, if there's a market with a 121 today, you're saying that the safety driven value is the number one driving need for autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's my position and I'm sticking to it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. And five years from now, you define the size of the market by the trillions of the size of the aviation market. But realistically, Let's say you're in front of a group of investors and they're thinking, is this a company, is this a space\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, you think I wasn't being realistic? All right, okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And if this is a space I want to invest in and this is a company I want to invest in, what are people willing to pay for in five years by market segment for autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>54:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most blunt way to put this that I think simplifies it, because yeah a trillion dollars, is a huge number. Let's see for your audience, let me decide how to answer this, because well, first, the most naive way to look at it is, okay, you're automating the aircraft. That's a function currently performed by the pilots. Well, what portion do, pilots contribute to the cost of aviation? And the answer to that is on part 25 aircrafts, it's close to 20 percent and on part 135, it's close to 30%. In some cases, it's 35 percent or more. A naive way to look at it is, okay, if all we do is reduce piloting costs, then it's 20 percent of the 800 something billion dollar, Part 121 world, which is a big number.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>54:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But Robert, it's not that autonomy would replace the pilot, it would just move it, right? There would be efficiencies in centralizing these pilot services so you can spread them around the network and make the network more efficient, that is for sure, but it wouldn't be a one for one replacement or removal of the pilot.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I would think that autonomy is necessary for replacing the pilot in Part 121, but it's not sufficient. There are a lot of other things roles that the pilot is playing in the airline and in the operation of that flight, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>55:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, and I don't want to say that it diminishes that cost to zero, but it is a substantial reduction. some of that I think still needs to be tested, and we're working towards testing it as soon as we have our STC. We'll be able to, to go test out this and validate the unit economics, but it is a substantial, we are anticipating a substantial savings Right out of the gate. just by having the pilot sit in a control center, the effective utilization of that pilot goes way up. this is especially true in 135 operations, where, pilots typically fly less than two hours a day. And having them in a control center, they could fly a lot more. But then, that, I don't think that's looking deep enough that's, as I said, the naive way to look at it, the very, the oversimplification, where this gets quite a bit more nuanced, is when you look at how you can change the way your operations work, now that the pilot is in the control center. And the first thing there that we hear from operators that's most important to them is repositioning. Freeing the aircraft from the pilot, and this could even just be a completely empty plane that just needs to deadhead somewhere, a repositioning flight, would drive huge operational efficiencies. determining the value of this is complex. It depends on an operator to operator basis. But the feedback that we've received from many of them is that this is a substantial driver for them. The second is being able to, right size the aircraft, up gauge or down gauge. if you're remote piloting and you're flying an airplane that has a much more simplified interface, and the automation is taking care of all of the aircraft's specific details for you then, you don't necessarily need to be specifically trained, aircraft to aircraft. And so you can switch flying, one morning you might fly a Cessna Caravan, and then the next you might fly something like a Cessna SkyCourier. You can't do that today. It's not considered safe. It's not safe to have people trained up to fly multiple aircraft simultaneously and be jumping around back and forth because it's hard to maintain proficiency, across different aircraft types. maybe some pilots would disagree with me. I'm going to take that position, and there's many operators that take that position, even within, like, variations of the Airbus fleet. there's some operators I know, they will not let their 320 pilots that are trained to fly one avionics configuration fly the other because they don't consider it safe. So, remote piloting, you can now do that. and that, it also enables a huge amount of operational efficiency, being able to right size the aircraft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what do you see as the time horizon for Reliable to be able to realize that vision? I want to tie back to Jim's question, on that five year time horizon, unlocking value for the company. You've been focused on the Caravan of which, roughly 3, 000 have been manufactured in its lifetime. a subset of those are in a type of operation that falls within your target market. But what does it take to expand the footprint of your product via STC into other platforms? How much time does that take? And does all of this happen within the time horizon that Jim laid out in his question, as we, we drill down from the top level market size down to the direct market that you can capture in five years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>58:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The key inflection point for us is, once we've got this system certified and operating on one aircraft type because of our focus on certification and the certification basis and all of the tools that we've developed to enable these, processes and analyses to be performed, don't anticipate it to take all that much time to transition the technology to subsequent aircraft. So I see an inflection point for us where once this is certified on one aircraft, boom, we can quickly scale to modify it and deploy it to other aircraft. So the time horizon question in my view gated or the critical path is on getting this very first system certified. That's the focus. so then you're going to ask me, well, when do you think that's going to happen? And it's hard to say. for all of the reasons we've been talking about previously, these systems engineering processes are very complicated and when you start digging into the details, you find things and it's hard to predict when you're going to be done. I can tell you when I'd like to be done. And I can tell you the dates that we have in mind, the team is tracking. but it's challenging to predict because nobody has ever done this before.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:03\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is your development path of a radar capability, is that on the critical path to what you're describing here?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The radar itself, the hardware, the software, the signal processing, no, the certification basis, yes, that is a component. I wouldn't say that's the, the biggest thing that's keeping me up at night, but it's certainly, it's a, an important component. The FAA has accepted, a set of standards for air to air radar. To my knowledge, nobody has yet driven that all the way through the certification process. We will likely be the first, and we're going to encounter things when we do that, and it's hard to predict how long it's going to take.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:00:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so when you, embarked on this project and you did the breakdown of, okay, well, are there ways that we can acquire this data? And I know that you have, done a lot of thinking on that. are there ways that we can lean on the supply chain to get a radar solution that meets our needs versus, what is the, time and investment and risk involved in developing our own? walk the audience through what those choices looked like and how you settled on this path?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:01:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, this is a recurring theme or nightmare of my career. we, we dealt with a lot of this at, previous companies that I'd worked at. you're trying to do something new. You're trying to put a product out in the world that nobody has ever done before. And you want to do it as quickly as you can. And so your mind goes immediately to, okay, who can we partner with? who can we get this component from? Radar was one where we had been trying for a very long time, to convince another set of developers, I won't mention any names, but companies you've heard of, to go build, a radar that meets our requirements, or rather meets the requirements the FAA has already published. And we've said, if you build this thing, we will buy it. And we've got customers, and this is how many units, you can expect us to purchase from you on this rough time horizon. And this has happened with us, with radars. It's happened, with actuators. It's happened with flight computers, with IO concentrator computers. It's happened with, our communication system. There's a couple of these key components that we didn't initially set out to build this ourselves, but we ended up deciding to bring it in house because we either, couldn't get anybody else to build it for us, period, we couldn't get anybody else to build it on a reasonable timeline, or we couldn't get anybody else to build it at a reasonable cost. And with the radar in particular, that was one where we went back and forth for a very long time, and eventually it just became clear that we're burning more time trying to convince this other group to go after this billion dollar market opportunity when we could just be spending this time building it ourselves. And at least then we build ourselves, when we encounter issues deploying it, which we inevitably will, it will at least be a misery of our own making.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So let's dig in on that project. what are the deficiencies that you are trying to address with this in house R&amp; D to build a radar that meets your needs? What are the gaps between what's available and what you want? And what do you see as the resources required to pull it off? Radar is not like a weekend project, right? It is an industry all in of itself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, it's not? Oh,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>there's actually a\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:38\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was told it was going to be done next weekend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>there's a lot of rapid innovation that's going on in that space right now. And so how do you look at that, risk versus reward profile?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first one realization was that radar, the components to build a more sophisticated radar have become more widely available in recent years. If we were having this conversation five years ago, I think you would be on much firmer ground to say that we're crazy. But now much of the signal processing technology, has become commoditized through deployment of global 5G networks. Antenna manufacturing is still, really tricky. and there are a few areas where we are still partnering, but, we're now the main integrator of the component. I'm not answering your question. You went to, What was the first part of your question again?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The first part of the question was, the required resources and the gaps that you're trying to close between what's available in the market and what you need to have a radar solution that works in the National Airspace System for autonomous flight. And then what are the resources required to pull off that R&amp; D project and what is the, risk profile of that undertaking?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:04:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Roughly speaking, the air to air radar requirements for an autonomous aircraft, the reason you're putting a radar in there is to comply with 91.113 see and avoid requirements. And RTCA, a major standards body has been publishing, Minimum Operating Performance Standards for air to air radar systems for several years, the FAA has accepted, some of this work through, the TSO publications that they've put out. the requirements for those radar systems are largely a function of encounter speed, and within that, you have a range and resolution and tracking requirements, so you need to be able to see something at a certain range, you need to be able to infer its velocity at a certain amount of precision, and then you need to be able to track it, at some particular rate, and you need to be able to track a certain number of things, and you also need, a certain amount of visibility, vertically and horizontally. so those are the requirements. so this might be, I don't know, you might need to see out to 6 or 7 nautical miles, for example, and you may need to be able to see another aircraft that's moving 400 knots relative to you, for example. that then, it just goes to radar physics, and from radar physics, you conclude, okay, well, if we're going to use this radio frequency spectrum, then we need something this size and this power, and we need this many antenna elements, and then you go out to the market, now to answer your question, you look at, okay, who has a radar that meets these requirements, or is close, or could modify something to meet the requirements. In there, radar developers, fall into three buckets. you've got existing aviation certified radars that are designed for weather applications. those have incredible range, but the resolution and tracking is not sufficient. You've got military radars, which definitely have the range, definitely have the resolution and tracking capability, but they are tremendously expensive, they're huge, and they consume a lot of power. And it's hard to imagine how installation of some of those systems would be practical at scale on a Part 23 aircraft. And then you've got, sort of new entrant radar manufacturers that are using clever algorithms to do things at lower power with less, radar reflectivity information, and it's tricky to see how they modify those systems and scale them up, because they don't currently meet all of the requirements. And so that, that investigation led us down the path of, okay, let's try and convince one of these folks that are operating in the radar development space today to modify their system to meet the FAA's requirements. And that's ultimately what led us to where we are today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:49\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What technologies do you foresee being an important and necessary onboard part of an aircraft, as opposed to, being offered as a service? What do you think is the right combination for the mission that you are pursuing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think what you're question, getting at here, is what are the key technology components that are necessary to enable autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Especially in the context of detect and avoid, obviously you can have a radar onboard, which you are pursuing, but you can also, and you've had some experience, so maybe you can share some of the, insight with the audience here in terms of, asking for primary surveillance data from the FAA radar feeds. how do you think the market evolves around what ultimately gets equipped onboard versus what gets offered as a service. And then how does that change depending on the mission?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:08:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, I see what you're getting at. I think of the technology that enables autonomy in two different categories. Step one of autonomy is to have an autonomous aircraft. an aircraft that can manage itself through all phases of flight. The second thing you need is you need an airspace integration solution that integrates that autonomous aircraft into the system that we have today. And I see these as distinctly different things. Autonomy, or the airborne automation component, consists of all of the things that you would need to do automated taxi, takeoff landing. You need also a high reliability vehicle management system that can manage the fuel, circuit breakers, and all of the other subsystems that exist on aircraft, to keep the aircraft in a safe configuration. And now once you have that, once you have an aircraft that's capable of flying itself through all phases of flight, then it becomes a question of, okay, how do you integrate this into the airspace? And that's where you need to comply with 91.113 see and avoid requirements. And that's how you end up with the air to air radar. You need to communicate with air traffic control and surrounding aircraft. That's how you end up with the communication system. We have a dual redundant satellite communication system that we're working on certifying. And then finally, you need the ground control station, and to satisfy all of the human factors requirements associated with, with that interface.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>but specifically see and avoid, where do you see the, the market converging, onboard radars or, surveillance data that is provided as a service.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's actually long term it's going to be a fusion of many things, because air to air radar is good at certain things. Primary surveillance radar is good at other things. camera systems are good for other types of things. and so I think we'll see, a fusion. Our path that we're taking, now, and what we believe will first be accepted by the FAA for aircraft the size of the Caravan will be an air to air radar system, and that will meet the requirements and allow us to do operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can you tell us about your experience requesting primary surveillance data from the FAA?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:10:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah, so primary surveillance radar, for those not familiar, these are radar systems that were initially put together by, a lot of them were built by the U S air force, for national security purposes. And then the data was released to the FAA for air traffic control purposes. They've since been augmented with transponder data feeds, and the combination of the primary radar with the transponder feeds, is frequently referred to as secondary surveillance radar. and the pictures of air traffic controllers, the screens that they're looking at is, is a terminal that shows you a fusion of primary and secondary, surveillance radar. Or frequently just secondary, but, they have the capability to see primary as well. Primary surveillance radar, in the United States, and there's some publications that the Air Force has put out there on this, is pretty incredible. There are very few places in U. S. airspace that are not covered by primary surveillance radar, and for the types of operations that we need to do with small cargo aircraft like the Caravan, it's possible to fly the Caravan and stay within primary surveillance airspace with sufficient margin to see all of the things around that aircraft. And we've shown through a variety of simulations. There was some work that we did with NASA several years ago on this. we've collaborated with some folks at MIT Lincoln Labs, on this as well.

I think we talked about this in that article in The Air Current. and that was partly how we demonstrated the efficacy of PSR for solving this problem. and then we went to go do another set of test demonstrations and our access was revoked and the message that we got back was that too many other groups had taken notice of what we did.

We care about national security. I care about national security too. We anticipated this and we proposed a number of processes that the FAA and the DoD could use to secure the data. We even went so far as to, suggests that the data only be accessed within locked facilities that are access controlled and follow a variety of NIST standards for cybersecurity and none of that was accepted. And my understanding is, the FAA is continuing to look at this. They are making progress with the DOD on how to release the data. I've even had executives in the FAA tell me that they think it is in the interest of national security to release the data because if they don't, then it means private companies, potentially foreign owned private companies, might stand up their own radar networks and have better surveillance in the airspace than the United States government does.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stand up their own primary radar within the United States, foreign governments?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Foreign owned companies may do this, and I would say that there are private companies today that already have stood up their own radar systems at airports.

We started this airline. We view it as an incubator and this gets to what we were talking about earlier with the certification of the airborne component and modifying the Ops spec for the airline. We decided to bring that portion of it in house so that we can modify the OpsSpec ourselves first in a very small airline, relatively small airline, I should say. And once we figure out how to do this and get the FAA to approve it, our intention is to then license it out so that other airlines can benefit from it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And what do you see as the optimal position to occupy along the value chain? What are the pros and cons for each? Whether you're an OEM, an operator, an avionics supplier, an airframer, in this world of autonomy?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:17:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think there's places for everybody to, to get wins. OEMs are going to benefit because autonomous versions of the aircraft are going to sell much more than other versions. Maintenance providers, FBOs, are going to benefit because there'll be different maintenance challenges. We were talking earlier about ground handling complexities with remote piloting and how we're going to figure all that out. And fixed base operators and others are going to benefit from that. Component suppliers are going to benefit by pushing the technology out. Airlines, obviously, are going to benefit through operational efficiencies. Where we see ourselves fitting in is we want to provide a few of the core components, not all, but a few of the core pieces of equipment, and we want to provide the certification services to get the equipment put into use. And I'm talking about the airborne component as well as the Airline operations component. And then there will also need to be ongoing, services, communication services, as well as detect and avoid and other cloud based, aircraft management components that you'll need in order to be able to run this technology at scale. And I think that's an area where, we'll be able to provide value for our customers too.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:18:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Robert, do you see companies that are building autonomous flight technology in the small UAS space entering this value chain and being a player in the coming years? On the one hand, they are developing very rapidly. They're able to do tighter iterations. They're able to fly a lot more hours. On the other hand, they're, building their innovations in a different airspace regime, below 400 feet, different requirements for that. But I think one could argue that some of the technologies that are being matured there are advancing very rapidly and, have relevance in the rest of the airspace system. So when you look out ahead, where do you see those manifesting in the value chain?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:19:14\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I'd go back to what we were talking earlier about military UAS and applicability. I'd give you almost the same answer. in order to meet the certification requirements, the regulatory requirements, you've got to take it all the way back, to the beginning. And while I'm sure there are lessons being learned in the small UAS space and, we're benefiting from work that's been done there, early work with Beyond Visual Line of Sight, the core components and the regulatory basis, I don't see that carrying forward. It'd be like saying an autonomous fork truck in a warehouse is going to turn into a self driving car. Sure, like, there's aspects of it that we'll carry over, but it's just a very different design domain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:20:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you don't see potential of the safety case and the data built up in that domain being extended into other types of flight or other parts of the airspace system, that's really just not going to be a factor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Robert:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:20:13\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I hate to give you a firm no, because there may be an element to this that I'm missing, but, I, I struggle drawing a straight line between the two. the Part 107, uh, 44807 exemption space, It's just very different from part 23 aircraft and part 25 aircraft.

Wernher von Braun was the designer of the Saturn V. and he said, I've learned to use the word impossible with the greatest of caution.

I don't think that's going to be a problem. However, I would pivot slightly on the technology that I really think that certification is the challenge. Certification is the challenge. We need the FAA to do this. This takes a massive public private partnership, and, I know I'm the one you're speaking with, but, and I'm representing Reliable Robotics, but I also feel like, the FAA has a big role to play here. And it's of crucial importance that Americans especially take note of this and inform members of Congress that the FAA needs support to do this. If we want the United States to continue to be a leader in aviation, we need to be putting more resources into the FAA.

We, are margin constrained and. It was like, Oh, right and so what I realized is that we need to solve the problem.

Welcome back to The Vertical Space and our discussion with Dr. Yemaya Bordain as president of the Americas of Daedalean. From right out of the gate, Yemaya challenges, much of today's established thinking. Listen to what she says is an area where very few in the industry agree with her on. And where she questions the near term economic viability of the UAM model. And that she believes level four autonomy is needed for UAM economic viability. And listen to later in the podcast, when she believes level four, autonomy may come about. Those investing in UAM should pay close attention to Yemaya's comments. We first discuss the history of automation. The why of automation on a segment by segment basis. What has and what will drive the need and how does it scale? Followed closely by a detailed discussion on the levels of automation and the value of each. As well, as in what market the Daedalean is spending most of their time today and why. And how safety improvements are the biggest near term opportunities in this market. Listen to Yemaya's first discussion with operators on autonomy, particularly commercial operators. What's also interesting is the role or lack of a role for AI at the different levels of automation? Next is a detailed discussion on the future of avionics, starting with discussion of Yemaya's white paper. We enter into a detailed discussion on why AI needs multi-core processors and the difficulty of certifying MCPs. And listen to Yemaya's response to Luka's question on whether or not there can be a generalized approach to certifying MCPs and how Yemaya thinks that autonomy and certification of AI in MCPs will change the existing value chain in avionics. She also discusses the levels of automation where Daedalean will be generated revenue and what markets including AAM over the next 10 plus years. Her summary at the end of the discussion is inspiring. Yemaya, thank you for joining us and to our listeners, enjoy this terrific discussion with Dr. Yemaya Bordain as you innovate and The Vertical Space. Dr. Yemaya Yemaya Bordain joined to Daedalean in October, 2022, as president of the Americas to lead innovation, flight testing, and partnerships. Previously, she spent seven years at Intel developing industry, leading to advances in partnerships with top global OEMs, including Lockheed Martin corporation, Collins Aerospace, Indra systems, and Mercury Systems. She earned her BS in electrical engineering and MS in Computer Science at Clark Atlanta at University and a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, welcome to The Vertical Space. It's a real pleasure to have you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, thank you so much for having me. I'm so excited to be here today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:47\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We are, too. We are, too. So let's start with the one thing that very few in the industry agree with you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>4:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lately, I've been going to and even speaking at some of these Urban Air Mobility, conferences and I think that there's a business case, problem that, Urban Air Mobility has particularly for people carrying, operating cost, the cost of total ownership, the cost of the airframes, less range, slower, and carrying people, especially when they need to carry luggage, I just think that there, there should be some, analyses that is less optimistic than some of them that I've seen recently and, more feasible and truly take into account, how the airspace is operated today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. so the need for high levels of autonomy to scale is what you'd like to underline in this viewpoint, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>5:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, the economic viability in, our minds, it doesn't happen until one is able to scale and automation, autonomy, these will address the operating cost significantly and enable that scale. And so we believe that we don't see economic viability until at least what we call like a level four, autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:09\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Interesting. let's set the stage, understanding that aviation has a rich history in automation from a hundred years plus. And so describe to us the evolution of automation in aviation from its very early days to today and how we think about autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>6:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh man, great question. I guess when we think about it in terms of that, automation and autonomy could potentially be its own scale, in relative scale versus absolute scale. I'm certain that, Sperry's gyroscope, seemed like a huge, device that drove automation. and it came only, what, six years after the Wright Brothers, flew, right? some other huge advancements included Fly by Wire, enabling, pilots. to fly the aircraft through a computer. that, that was huge, right? And in fact, one of my favorite technical papers that exists is, the, fly by wire system architecture that was published on the A320. It's, it honestly, it's actually what taught me how, important flight safety is and how people design safe systems. And then, finally today, autonomy looks like everything, being Digital, all pilot tasks moving toward being taken over by, ultimately silicon plus algorithms.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>7:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, historically, the introduction of, automation in flight. as I describe it, was initially because of the expansion of the envelope of the aircraft. aircraft became, faster, they flew higher, they flew farther. So there was a need to alleviate the pilot mechanically from, the stick and rudder skills. And it was much more difficult with these higher dynamic loads to move the control surfaces and therefore increasing level of automation. And then, I guess another phase could be the use of automation to reduce the cognitive load of the pilot to then, paint a better situational awareness picture or just operate more efficiently and safely in the increasingly, busy airspaces and complex scenarios. And so what about now? What is this? Is this a scale? the next frontier that introduces this new wave of automation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:42\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Luka, you mean in terms of the motivation for, why are we pursuing this?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:46\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. this arc of introducing various degrees and kinds of automation and what is really the motivation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>8:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think you're right on with scale, accessibility, cost. In today's, general aviation market, it's, safety enhancements. general aviation has so much headroom for safety and automation can enable, GA to enjoy the safety levels that are available to the commercial market. I do believe that it's driven by cost, it's driven by scale, it's driven by, people wanting more accessibility. It's driven by our world, being more connected and requiring, being able to, engage a lot faster, right? There used to be email and, You could expect that someone would respond to your email within two days or then within a day. Now you just text people, right? So I think a lot of the driving forces behind it is really, along the lines of the trends of society today, mostly driven by scale and cost.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>9:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Peter, since you asked, what jumps to mind to you when we introduce this arc and this motivation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>10:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think it's really interesting to look across the segments of aviation and, okay, number one, you look at the opportunity to automate, and then number two, you look at, well, what differential does it deliver and let's say in commercial aviation, it is, It's exceptionally safe today, it has a level of automation but it's not the type of automation that we're looking ahead to, nor is it, a level of automation that you would describe as autonomous behavior. but in that segment, there is, a lot of resistance to, bringing in high levels of autonomous flight, reducing cockpit crew from two to one. there are a lot of motivations that people are pursuing it, but there's a lot of resistance to doing that. in other parts of aviation, you have a different landscape. You do have a safety opportunity, but you might have, a different customer profile. Where I think it's really interesting is some segments of aviation, UAS, they're physically so small that putting a human on board to operate it is just, fundamentally not an option. This is a 40 pound air vehicle. And so in those segments, you have an incredibly high motivation to, bring the level of automation up to whatever is required for the mission, call it autonomous flight in some cases, if you want, because that's what makes the, mission possible. and in some of these segments, as you highlight, making that mission possible is world changing. It will change our perception of how we think about moving things around the world, how we think about the time and space around us. given all these different, segments of aviation, they share some technological similarities, they might be operating a different scale, it might be a different mission profile, but there's a lot of commonality in the technology that pulls this off, that allows us to achieve this vision and looking at it through that lens is what... has me so interested in this question of motivation because like everybody, I just took it for granted that of course we want autonomous flight. It's a new technological horizon. Let's go and build it. But then in conversations with people in industry, it struck me like, wait, let's take a step back and think about what is the real motivation and which segment of aviation is the path of least resistance to build up the technology, to build up the operational experience, that kind of organizational muscle, to then really realize the vision. And maybe it propagates from there, but where do you start?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>12:40\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>so I, to address What you stated, it's such a good point. by training, I'm an engineer and I absolutely positively nerd out on new technology, and I find that much of the industry does that as well. And so your point of course we want automation. Of course we want autonomy. I initially geeked out about that as an engineer and just, this is so cool. We totally should do this. And it was after the fact that I challenged myself and my team to dig into why do you want autonomy? What does automation and autonomy deliver? And that's when we were able to, realize or, reveal that we want enhanced safety. We think that this can reduce labor cost. we think that this can enable the optimization of crew, it can streamline operations, potentially even, lead to simpler maintenance, fuel and energy consumption. We just, we realized that we wanted to focus more on the why of automation and autonomy, and of course, be pioneers of how we get there as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:04\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yamaya, it's interesting. you proud yourself on being a problem solver. I've read a lot about you and I've seen you in interviews and we're talking about the foundation of why autonomy, but the reason you say some people may not agree with you is that you're saying that the advanced air mobility passenger carrying world won't be viable without what you're claiming to be fully autonomous, which is, four out of the five stages. So you're saying that the very business proposition of AAM won't be viable without autonomy. So that's a pretty darn good reason. A lot of us agree with you on that. And so if we need a motivation... For autonomy and advanced air mobility, this is one of them, because even the public companies are saying that we can be profitable, but for them to be able to meet their financial projections, some level of autonomy, you call it fully automated automation, as\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>automation. Yeah,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>14:59\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You're saying that has to be achieved. So what a motivation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>15:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that you can only get there when you sit down and start talking to operators. and in particular, you start talking to today's civil airspace, those operators. I remember having, meetings with a very large operator and, I was so focused on how cool the technology was. And, this is when I started at, Daedalean, I was so focused on how cool the technology was that I just assumed that he got it when I said automated or autonomous. And I didn't get the same kind of excitement from him that I expected. And I took him to the side and I said, Hey, can you give me, very direct feedback? Why weren't you so excited? And he said, well, one, I don't think that automation or autonomy is going to happen for next decade. that makes you not very useful to me, right now in, in what you're providing, if you're leading with that. but secondly, he said, Yemaya, we are not, a risk environment. We, are margin constrained and. It was like, Oh, right and so what I realized is that we need to solve the problem. We're problem solvers, each one of us, even, the engineers. I was trying to solve a technological problem, but we're really supposed to be solving an operational problem. And that operational problem is an economic viability issue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>16:33\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. we had, several guests in the course of the podcast series where we discussed autonomy and it's always interesting to hear their thoughts on the reasons why autonomy, we talked a little bit about this now over the last several minutes, but I think it's worthwhile hovering a little bit more and going to a bit more detail, perhaps on a segment by segment basis, commercial, airline operations, part 121 operations general aviation, UAS, all of the other segments. And describe what are some of the common misconceptions in terms of the reasons for autonomy, versus what you think autonomy is helpful for, right? what's in the back of my mind is a conversation that we had with, Brian, Yutko from, Wisk, and on that topic, he mentioned that, a common misconception is that people tend to drive their economics discussion around autonomy in terms of the removal of the cost of the pilot in the operation, whereas he says, no, that's totally not the point. The point is in a better management of an asset, from a network perspective and being able to reposition those assets and separate the human operator from the actual vehicle and how that opens up the, operational freedom and the network design freedom, which totally makes sense and similarly, there are. misconceptions around safety where people jump to the conclusion that, removing the pilot will automatically result in safety. So give us your thoughts around this. It's a kind of long way of saying, let's go a layer deeper into why autonomy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>18:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I, absolutely positively agree with Brian. We also are not driving toward removal, or, nor do we think that in, in every, application, the removal of a pilot is the best thing. And in fact, when we deliver talks and talk about the levels of, autonomy, we've started looking at those in terms of Search and Rescue, there's, Offshore Oil, Transport. There is, Law Enforcement and Surveillance. We, there's HEMS, there are many that we said, yeah, these could be along the spectrum. of, automation, but they're not appropriate for full automation and full autonomy. And, we define the difference between the two of those, as full automation the aircraft is, self separate, but there is a human in the loop. who is monitoring, the decisions that are being made and then for full autonomy, there's no human in the loop. This thing just runs, by itself uninterrupted and unmonitored. And, so for that reason, we think that it is a common misconception that saying that you want to, develop autonomous or automated systems means that you want a world where there are no pilots. it's quite the opposite. We want pilots to, be managing the decisions, the processes, that are reserved only for humans that's where we think that, it continues to be in, especially in very, dynamic and, environments that are changing quite a bit. And even in those, we talk about that a bit as well of when should you use AI versus not AI and where there are benefits. But, we want to augment pilots, we want to support pilots, we want to lower the pilot workload, we want to enable operators to scale, we want to address the cost by using, resources a lot more efficiently.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>20:20\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you looked across, those different operations and CONOPS, on the one hand you look at the ultimate manifestation of autonomous flight and you say, okay, well, where does this really fit in? And maybe it's transoceanic cargo as you mentioned, did the stepping stones to get there also surface from all of those conversations where you see, hey, okay, here's the state of the art today. And if we push one step further, what is a sensible application for that where we could, deploy it, build up experience with it and have a marketable. solution out there. did the path to get there, surface from those conversations? And I'd love to get your thoughts on what that looks like, whether we really need AI or not in order to go down that path. what did that look like? what emerged from that\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>21:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. We looked at these different CONOPS. we approached it in a few different ways. We looked at the, segments, the market segments within aerospace and, not including defense. we don't, support defense applications as a company. and we looked at GA, we looked at commercial, we looked at even, UAS and we looked at UAM, it as its own kind of use cases or segment as well. because we do think that it in the way that it will, be developed, it'll be, a pretty unique, use case or a pretty unique segment. we looked at those and we segmented them in margin versus volume. We, also looked at, the, pilot tasks that can be automated, as you go along. So for instance, being able to detect obstacles or other, aircraft, in the airspace. and we looked at it in, in ConOps and what we were trying to get to, is where automation and autonomy could address, a segment that, is currently high revenue generating, even if it's not high margin, because the costs are so extreme, or the costs are just, they're prohibitive, put it that way. and we thought through some of those applications and then we dug more into those and what parts of that if we were to, automate certain tasks or automate, certain parts of, these operations, what, how could we get a bigger bang for our buck, in order to enable, these things to scale? We also, took some applications that we think probably would fall under kind of lower automation, say for instance, Search and Rescue, where, you know, the environments are really dynamic and the mission itself is dictating, say, the navigation, of the airframe, right? And in those cases, we thought that, okay, how can we support the pilot workload, the pilot that is, flying, but then there's the, operator that's managing the mission, right? That's basically telling the pilot, go here, go there. So we thought about that as well. And we said, look, we just don't think that there is a huge opportunity here, but there are definitely some specific tasks and areas where, we can assist the pilot. And so we thought through that as a spectrum and we went through tens of CONOPS in order to rank them along, different scales.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You have mentioned level four and level five automation. do you mind just mentioning the five just for our audience? Because it's cool how you refer to CONOPS and levels of automation, but if you could just, go from assistance to partial automation to highly automated, just briefly define them for our audience. And then as you refer to from level one to level five, they'll have a sense for you, what you mean by, for example, even where's the low hanging fruit for automation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>24:36\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, absolutely. Level one, human has, full responsibility. And this is just for task assistance. So the AI, Pilot Not Flying or, AI Co Pilot. Sometimes we call it AI Co Pilot. Sometimes we call it Pilot Not Flying or Pilot Monitoring it provides just assistance to the pilot for, situational awareness. And the AI provides... situational intelligence. So this is the ability for the pilot to not only understand the current situation, but also to be able to predict the future and anticipate, any potential problems in the future. So what humans do today with semantic understanding is that we paint a picture and we're able to identify threats that could happen in one second, five seconds, 10 seconds. That's what the AI brings. And in this case, we are just providing the pilot with task assistance. and our first product, PilotEye is a great example of this. PilotEye is a traffic advisory system that uses, camera inputs and neural networks to draw a box around anything else that's in the airspace. And, what is the value proposition there? Well, when you're using cameras and neural networks, we identify non cooperative traffic. We identify birds and drones and paragliders and, hot air balloons, right? And the point is not necessarily to say this is exactly where it is, but the system, it provides that input to say, look up. There's something there, and we, we want your attention here because we see something there that is not, going to be identified, through a transponder.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And Yemaya, what segment of the market are you targeting with Pilot Eye?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:32\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, PilotEye is, GA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:34\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>that's interesting because as we were discussing earlier, GA is the segment where, safety is a concern more than for other segments of the market. But at the same time, it is a segment that doesn't really have a high willingness to pay for new technology. So how have you thought through the business case. How do you articulate value?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>26:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Oh my gosh. That is such a great question because this is the, it's the ongoing question, right? And sometimes it's even, what divides your BD team from your engineering team? Because engineers want to do cool stuff. and engineers want to develop the best of the best and we have to remind our teams that, Hey, just to let you know, right, these things need to sell for 15K, 20K, right, 30K.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:23\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. And at the same time, the community is struggling to sell 500 transponders,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>27:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. Absolutely. this is where that analysis that I spoke of earlier, where we assess the market along ConOps, but also along, the high revenue generating, ConOps and applications because there is a bit more flexibility in those markets and then we drive toward there. And there are some applications where. I've had conversations with, operators and they've stated, yes, we won't pay, I'm making it up, a hundred K for this, but definitely the cost benefit justifies, us paying more for this because this is a real threat for operations and it could lead to loss of airframe, which in that case, then you're talking about millions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>PilotEye has applications for Level 1 automation, which is the category of assistance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Level two. What about\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:27\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Level 2 partial automation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>28:29\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Level two. Human pilot still has full responsibility. the AI pilot not flying, provides assistance and forecasting risk in offering mitigation. Again, this could be something where, the, the system not only, identifies that the traffic is there, but it also could say that, there is a bird there and you are on, a direct collision course and it could offer mitigation in, for instance, providing a maneuver. So this could be like a TCAS2. if we, plug this into closed loop with, TCAS2, that, that provides some mitigation. Level 3.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If I may real quick, yeah, I'm assuming Captain Sullenberger would have, that would have been extraordinarily valuable in this situation where if he could have been notified, I think there were Canadian geese that around this certain direction. I'm not sure what he could have done different. Luka could probably could answer that better than me, but I would assume with that kind of capability in a commercial aircraft, would be a big deal where there's a lot of birds and obviously that had near catastrophic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>29:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that's why, as we're introducing PilotEye, that's why many get it. One operator that we met, he'd been flying helicopters basically his entire life because he learned, to fly from his dad. And he said while he was in, fixed wing training that he almost hit a bird and he, I think he said that he dove and he said, if I had your system during that time, he said, I thought I was going to die. And I could have died. I wish that your system was available to us at that time and, for the same reason, we think that you're right we can't say what could have happened, if Captain Sully had a system like ours, but we would love to believe that our system could have made, a difference in, the impact in the first place.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:31\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, can we quickly climb through the ladder and get through level five and then we'll get into the topic of, certifying these systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>30:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. level three, automated, autonomy, or automation, rather. the human pilot, it's either remote or on board, and it's still responsible for the decision making and execution of the system. And the AI, pilot monitoring provides, full guidance and, while the pilot still remains fully responsible. And this could be a system that, identifies a runway and then provides full guidance all the way down, to a safe landing. Level 4 is fully automated. In this case, the human pilot, is remote and supervises all of the AI decisions. And, the AI co pilot, is promoted to the pilot flying while there is a human pilot that is supervising and, can always interject if a wrong decision was made, but in this case, the airframe, the aircraft is self separate in, in the air. And then finally, Level 5 is what we call autonomous, that's the difference between fully automated and autonomous, and that's where there's no human and the, the AI pilot flying, has full authority.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>31:52\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What would be very cool to know, we're going to talk about certification here in a second, what would be very cool to know is what's the total available market, now, three years from now, five years from now, ten years from now, by level. you don't need to answer it now, but would be interesting is, my guess is four and five are near zero today. and then by level what's the available market for your technology with its application of AI, that would be interesting to know, you don't need to answer it now. Maybe at the end of the podcast or, maybe at another time to see what these opportunities are, in\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:26\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's great. Our team is going to go back and definitely take a look at, from that perspective. I love it. That's a great way to slice this as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>32:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>in preparation of the podcast, we've read your white paper with Intel, I think it was earlier this year, on the future of avionics. and there were some really interesting points that, I'd love to uncover in a bit more detail here. the paper outlines, really two main challenges around the future avionics. One is the software assurance problem for AI and for neural networks, and in this case for Pilot Eye with the use of neural networks and computer vision, And then the second one as these neural networks require really higher levels of computational resources, necessity to use multi core processors in avionics. two really fascinating topics for us. So let's start with the first one or actually you pick, but let's uncover both of these angles in some level of detail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:24\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. now we're getting into my passion and where I start to nerd out because by training, I am a, Silicon Person. My doctorate is in electrical and computer engineering I did atomic force microscopy looking at, individual, transistors and how, electrons and photons, I'm sorry, electrons and,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I like that. Infotants.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>33:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How they move through individual gates. And so this is really cool. I was at Intel for, what? Seven years before going to Daedalean. And I actually met Daedalean, in my work at Intel in driving, multicore adoption to higher DAL levels in the avionics space. So I love this topic of processing and how to, compute massive amounts of data, on systems that have to meet the size weight and power constraints of gravity. This is, again, on, this, idea of high performance computing, this is where gravity becomes a big challenge. and so I've spent, years trying to support and solve this problem. The challenge with, artificial intelligence is, again, it requires a lot of processing, resources that for certification or systems that needed to be certified, systems that were safety critical systems, it's pretty unprecedented to require this much performance. And, for instance, flight control systems don't require a whole lot. but, when you're working with a lot of data and you're needing to process a lot of data very quickly, particularly that are coming from, image frames, it becomes quite challenging. So this was a problem that Daedalean did not set out to solve when the company was founded in 2016, our co founders were fully intent on solving the software problem. And, that software problem is really around how do we ensure software assurance when it's a machine learned system, and you're running machine learned algorithms. And Daedalian worked with the EASA and published the first guidance or theory on an approach on how to certify machine learning and found that, some of the differences is in, say, Software Assurance, Code Traceability is really huge. Well, when it's a machine learned system, data traceability is just as, or even more important, for those systems. And, we co published with the EASA, a series of papers, CODAN, Concepts of Design Assurance for Neural Networks. And this was the first guidance on how to manage machine learning systems. And we found that really the focus should be on the data management, data verification, ensuring that, your learning process is managed extremely well and, with high assurance and the way you train your models, all these things in, verifying that there's a, the learning process verification. There's the, model implementation. These are all along this process of assuring what we coined with the EASA in this, in these papers, learning assurance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:00\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can we talk about learning assurance a little bit more? Because even from the white paper, it left me, wishing for more, especially how you decompose the system level requirements into ultimately data sets, the algorithms, how you create these, offline, independent, annotated data sets. Tell us a little bit more about that particular aspect, how you run this learning assurance and, reach a level that is, by your own judgment, similar to software assurance for running a DO 178 project, for instance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>37:35\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>yeah. we, we said if I were to summarize what CODAN says, it essentially said that we want to ensure that the data that you train on is representative to your operating environment. And everything from there was how do you ensure that happens? And you have to get a ton, collect a ton of data, right? So we have to be basically constantly flying in order to collect, as much data, as we possibly can. You have to ensure that you have some processes and structures around, how you annotate that data. you have to ensure, that you, are managing the training of that, and the implementation, the verification and implementation, very tightly. And this idea of generalization or, ensuring that your data that you train and how you manage that data is representative of the real world. That is probably where the secret sauce is that we did not publish. And, the question, would remain, well, how much data do I need in order to get there? CODAN is really about the process in that way. It's very much so DO 254, DO 178C, right? It's really about the process, right? And operating in a very processed way, making sure that you have traceability, making sure that you are, clearly identifying and, describing your requirements, and that those requirements can be tested, right? And that, you're not using your training data on your testing set or the other way around, right? To make sure, that you're not over training. And so in, the CODAN paper and that approach, is very much guidance.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What can you tell us about this generalization and this data collection in a way that represents the actual real world environments? We'd love to learn a little bit more about that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>39:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'll give an example. Let's take PilotEye for an example. for PilotEye, we say that we want our system to be able to identify, traffic and, draw a, a box around it. and, in that case, your training data needs to be, a whole lot of data where you are seeing traffic. And where, you want to ensure that your requirements are well constrained. We start out on PilotEye in, daytime VFR. Right. And so that's, more about, well, then when the system goes into operation, we don't have performance guarantees on it at night because it's been designed and the process that we went through in our requirements, in our performance guarantees were around operations and daytime VFR. So that's one example of, how. We walked through, ensuring generalization, again, the secret sauce, and because we are currently, as far as we know, and even what EASA has stated publicly, we're the only company that is, in this process, we had stages of involvement, or SOI audit with the EASA, a few months ago, and that was the first time that had been done. It was a historic, event for us and for the EASA. we're learning along the way of how you actually prove that. that is another one where proving it is, the trade secret. And, that's something that we do plan to publish once we get certified.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>41:22\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I was just about to ask you that question, so I'm glad you brought it up. as I see it, perhaps there's two kind of sub discussions in this topic. one part of the conversation is addressing the non determinism of the systems. And, perhaps from your perspective, it's unfair to say that it's non deterministic, even though it's not a line by line kind of determinism it still doesn't produce a random result. There is still some kind of, probabilistic, obviously, but in inferring the function that takes the input to the desired output, even though it's not as transparent as line of code, it's still not random. So you can argue that there is some, I won't call it determinism in the DO 178 sense, but, there is some comfort there. But I think the more difficult question, is how do you actually prove that you can achieve safety, and established safety in all of the possible conditions that you can find yourself in. I think that's a much more difficult problem to do, correct? How do you view these two different arguments, and what's the latest regulatory thinking on it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>42:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, taking for a moment, taking certification out, just in, in software development and software engineering, Determinism is some given input, being operated on by a given operator I have the same output, even by the way, if that output is wrong every single time, but if it is exactly the same every single time, it is by definition a deterministic system, right? And that's what we're trying to get to. We're showing that, if in the way that we treat the data and in achieving generalization. That for given set of inputs, and that set of inputs is well defined in the requirements that, running through our model, we always will get the output, meaning that it'll be identified, say for a pilot eye, as an example. And so that means that we have to be clear and sure, on the where and what conditions it should be, operated. And again, if it's designed for daytime VFR, yes, it turns out that we've actually had some folks that have tested, our system at night and they're like, it works great at night. Well, that is great for us, but still, in getting certified, those performance guarantees are for very specific conditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>43:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so what stands in the way from having some of these frameworks for certifying ML based software be accepted as a means of compliance? What are the main remaining concerns that EASA, FAA, and other regulators around the world have?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>44:12\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The EASA is a bit further along, seemingly at least, with CODAN on how to treat, machine learning systems. I think one challenge and the bigger one that comes to mind right now is just in, having a harmonized approach. And our company is working, pretty closely, in order to drive towards some harmonized approach. Keep in mind that, PilotEye is currently in a process. And it's in a process through the FAA with concurrent validation with the EASA. And we gotta answer some of these questions as we're in the process, and I think we are. this process has been one that, from our perspective, we are we're thrilled, in it. Not saying that, any one of the agencies are, being progressive in any way, that definitely is not the case. however, one thing that we've noticed is that the agencies are really digging in and for instance, through CODAN, the coauthors on the EASA side, they previously had no experience with machine learning and they dug in, they got statistics, they dug into really understanding what is happening here so that they could provide some guidance, that, could support the overall objective of, providing some guidance for acceptable means of compliance. And so I gotta give kudos to both agencies because, they are learning and they are asking us a lot of questions and they are challenging us. And, they are, as we, drive toward this, this development and this effort, we are finding, that everyone wants to ensure that we do the right thing,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:05\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>other than harmonization, what are some of the ways that they challenge you? What are some of the questions that they raised?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>46:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, some of the questions, I'll say, Alright, one, one is, our CEO, Luuk, he has published a series of, blogs and blog posts and a video on explainability. And, so this is one area where, our approach and our, thoughts on explainability there could potentially be at least some areas where this, there's, some misalignment, and, so that's one of the areas where we're like, okay, what does that mean? And even if we have, a different approach or, We don't value that approach as much what does that mean for this project? And essentially, what do we have to do in order to prove explainability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:02\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And in terms of accumulating enough data to represent the real world environment, what's the role of synthetic data in this process? And what are some of the challenges that exist in leveraging synthetic data in simulation? How much is the regulator giving those, quote, credit?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:21\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That I can't say for certain, as I'm not that deeply into, the credit. I can say that, we leverage simulated data, for sure. Of course, in aerospace, flying is quite expensive, and so we leverage, simulated data. I can't say how much, but we definitely do in our approach.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And do you think that startups are at a disadvantage relative to incumbents as it relates to exactly this point of the, the cost associated with obtaining real world data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what is the role of startups?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>47:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think the role of startups is in, the innovation part. Startups have been phenomenal for driving the innovation that will transform aerospace. I really do believe that. I think startups have some risk, many have some risk of, not remaining super focused on their core IP. and, I see a lot more, vertical integration with, startups than you would for the more traditional aerospace market that it has been moving directly in the opposite direction for the last 10 or 15 years, right? in the broader aerospace market, open systems is everything. The United States DoD, they, at some point, they got sick of, the large air framers, I won't call any names, but the large air framers charging them insane amounts of, money just to change out a chip because For instance, it was something that it was an ASIC and it wasn't commercially available. It wasn't commercial off the shelf. So this, idea of vertical integration, there are parts of it that can be, a distraction for some startups that are, developing airframes. And I think that, your time to market is really important. you don't get credit for efficiency, you get credit for delivery focusing so much on your core IP and making sure that you're better than anyone else in the entire world on your core IP and outsourcing basically everything else when it is feasible and when it's viable, and leveraging the existing ecosystem. I believe those are the folks that are going to win.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:44\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As you were doing your certification with EASA, I'm assuming this is certification level C. is it, essentially level 1 through level 3? Okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>49:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is, well, two different things. DAL C, that's Design Assurance Level. Pilot Eye is, we're taking that to DAL C. That is separate from, the levels of automation, the PilotEye, we'd consider that to be a level one, assistance, pilot assistance system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:10\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But none of their certification so far is DAL A. You haven't, DAL B or to DAL A? Okay. It's all DAL C.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>50:17\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh gosh, yeah, Yeah, just so that we're reminded, there is currently, I believe there's currently only one computer, that is certified to DAL A, that is, on a multi core processor. That is running a CPU that is, I believe, already end of lifed, or close to end of lifed. and... A GPU that has already been end of lifed, this takes a long time, right? And so add AI to it and I think that, our first goal in delivering product and delivering, value has been, we just want to prove that you can certify AI. And once we prove that, right, then we can drive toward, higher levels, but keep in mind as well that you don't start with, I want to build a DAL A system or I want to build a DAL B system or DAL C system. You start with the intended function. And, you take your intended function, and then you break that into sub functions, and you, apply a functional safety or, hazard assessment, against those, you assign a hazard classification from level A through E, with A being the highest safety level, safety criticality, that's like a flight control system. With a level E being no, impact to safety. That is the toilet or the, in flight entertainment system. and only when you have a hazard classification, do you start designing your architecture because that tells you how much, mitigation that you need to apply, to any potential, hazards or, safety hazards. And those, mitigations can include redundancy, dissimilarity, for any commercial aircraft the flight control system is not only redundant but dissimilar. And there are flight control computers that are controlling individual flaps, or flight control surfaces, but those are copy exact two to three times, sometimes even four times. And then separately, those flight control computers are designed by two different companies, two different teams, and in most cases, even two different silicon, such that they want to ensure that there is no opportunity for, common mode errors when designing the software. For instance, if I, I have one piece of software that, leads to a fault, that, that does not cascade to every single flight control computer, on my airframe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>52:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, let's talk about multi core processors, MCPs. You mentioned that there's only one DAL A certified MCP, and it's using end of lifed CPUs and GPUs. We talked briefly about why AI applications need MCPs for the higher... compute requirements of, running, AI based algorithms on it. But why are MCPs so difficult to certify?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>53:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, MCPs are great. In the same way that MCPs are being used, in commercial electronics, for the higher performance, for, the lower power consumption, for the improved efficiency, scalability, being able to execute multiple workloads concurrently, low swap, all those things, are the reason for consumer electronics. Same thing in the Airframe. The issue, though, is that when you need to be certified, the software that's running on the, processor can no longer control all of the behavior of the silicon. So, for instance, in a single core processor, the software, and by software I mean the, the real time operating system, folks like, WindRiver, Lynx, Greenhills, they build this software, in, in that case, you're not competing for resources, you have only one core, you that is doing all of the computing, all of the processing and heavy lifting. And that one core is not competing, with another core for resources, more specifically memory, memory and cache, right? And so when you add additional cores, though, you lose the ability for the software to, control, all of the behavior of the processor. And so now, Core 1 and Core 2, or Core 1, Core 2, Core 3, Core 4, they're all competing for registers. They're all competing for memory, and to put an instruction, into memory, right? And what they generally do today is you start with partitions, and they partition based on the DAL level. And, the overall goal is to achieve, or bound, the worst case execution time. So that means that, let's say, I have, a system that is doing, some navigation, but it is also running, some, say, flight controls. pilot Pull Side Stick, that is a DAL A process, and there should be nothing that is possible that could interrupt that. There should be nothing, no way possible, that instruction, can be kicked off of memory because something else has come up. And, that other thing is now the higher priority. This happens, in consumer electronics, they're actually designed to do these things because, for performance, right? And so I, if I'm working on, Microsoft Word and I switched to another application and now I'm going to start streaming and I go back to my Microsoft Word, right? when I'm clicking back and forth and I'm telling it to do stuff and, play here, but also I want to go back and I want to start typing, for performance requirements, there are times where, for instance, instructions can be kicked out or they can be de prioritized and they're designed to do that. that's how you're able to get the gains that you are from, multi core processors. But, there should never be a case where a DAL C, application such as, displaying, traffic is more important than being able to control the airframe. And, this is why it's... It can be difficult, to certify MCPs because it comes down to a software issue and the software, not having, in the MCPs. The consumer processors not being designed with the tools for the software to monitor the processes, to control the processes fully, and ultimately to bound the worst case execution time. And, in these designs, we turn out to actually, I just say throttle the performance of the MCPs in order to make these guarantees for as much as we can on, developing the software that is going to run on, the processors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:08\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so, to what extent is certifying MCPs a purely technical problem of making sure that all of these interference channels and this fight for resources is managed? As opposed to the challenge of just not having visibility into the processor architecture because one of the things that you brought up in the white paper is that, silicon manufacturers are not very keen in sharing that level of detail that you would require in order to build this, resource sharing or mitigation that you mentioned. So, Which is it? What's the main problem? And in the case of, Intel through, the Airworthiness Evidence Package, sharing these... Certification Artifacts, does that solve the problem or is there still a problem remaining?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>57:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, This is, it's such a great question. So the airworthiness, evidence package at Intel, that is my claim to fame, I, co architected, safety critical avionics solutions and products for Intel, that product line is my baby and, where I really started in, safety applications, in aerospace. And the issue for the developers of these systems, they have to ultimately be able to predict every possible, failure condition that can happen, and that means that they need to be able to predict the behavior, every possible behavior of their system, right? Their ability to do that is limited to how much information they know about what the processor does and why it does what it does. And the Airworthiness Evidence Package. was about providing, that transparency to the developers, to the embedded, OEMs who are developing these systems. We, went through an analysis with them, and we wanted to understand, what is it, when you say that you want us to support you, OEMs, of the world who want to design in Intel. What is it that you actually need? What do you want? what information are you looking for? And initially when we got that information from them, we realized that there was a good amount of it that was trade secret. to the point that. it wasn't even available to just broadly to the company. And the second issue that occurred was that, the aerospace volumes are just not there. to get a company that is producing millions of processors per day for, consumer electronics orders and orders of magnitude, more volume to get them to operate outside of the process and provide transparency. initially there's, there was no real opportunity there, but what changed that was, it started with the autonomous driving, And a lot of what was necessary was needed for that as well. And Autonomous Driving immediately, they saw that, these are going to be volumes upon volumes of essentially then we also had the opportunity to be part of driving data centers, and there was a big opportunity. And so the aerospace teams, myself, in leading these efforts, we took advantage of what was already happening in order to support the automotive industry, and we conducted a gap analysis between the DO 254 with the, the 26262, which is the, safety guidance, on the automotive side. And for the data, there was data that already, existed, but we generally would not provide. This included, single event upset data, which we would never provide this data because in, in many ways, a knowledgeable, company with this information could essentially reverse engineer, the, architectures and get trade secrets, if they had that information. And so we provided that. We provided, then some, functional safety, failure modes, and errors diagnostic analyses, so we provided failure rate, we ran it through tools, in order to identify, some very critical, behavior of the silicon, such that then when it, was integrated into or would be integrated into a, system that the developer had enough information, that they could provide mitigations. It doesn't mean that you necessarily control it. It could mean that, okay, well, because I don't know when it's going to do this, or, this fault will happen in these very specific conditions. Now I have that information. Maybe that means that I need to provide redundancy and I need to run a separate, processor alongside it and then do some kind of checks, or maybe I need some kind of monitor of, another, processor, such as, say, like an FPGA that is monitoring the silicon and can do something when, this failure condition occurs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:30\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>do you think that there is a, path to a generalized approach to certifying MCPs as opposed to having to go through, a lot of, detailed analysis every time that there's a new processor on the market?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:02:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I, I think that we're probably about as generalized as we can get, the guidance is meant to, support, what is currently available. It's, CAS 32A, and I think it's the 193? Now, CAS 32A, I believe, is 193. And, so I think we're possibly about as generalized. When there's new silicon, there needs to be detailed analyses and particularly when silicon is meant and designed for a non safety application.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if you take one of these MCPs this certification process what's the expectation in terms of how many years it will remain technologically viable in the market? how much time do we get out of these things before either it becomes obsolete or before it's no longer available in the supply chain and you just have that inventory and that's it? What does that look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:03:37\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, these things go into service for 20 and 30 years. when you have an OEM, an air framer who is aligned on the silicon, you have to be ready to support them for decades. because the cost that are required in order to, provide assurance for these systems are so great. I'm only saying, right now we're talking about just the design, right? Software is its own monster. there was one case where I met with an OEM, a developer, and they said that, they had converted from Intel, by then they had converted from Intel into Power Architecture. By the time I was meeting with them, they said that it was like a decade ago. They said that still they were spending$1 million per year on the architecture, change. And this was in software investment. So it is great, the investment in, getting these things certified. And so they're expected to run, basically forever, essentially. and by the way, this is exactly why when there is a system that goes to market, when it goes to market, there are many stories that folks, particularly on the military side, they can say. I think the worst example was, I had a conversation with an officer. in a military agency that said, the day after we went into service of this airframe, the following day, we received a obsolescence, notice on the silicon this happens often. It's normal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wow. That's such a long timeline for these products. It's totally different than... other industries, and obviously it has all of these downstream implications for, how It's employed in higher level systems, obviously, which is fascinating.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:43\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely. Absolutely. And so this is why, we say, well, that we have that one system that's available. And I think it was launched last year, I believe. And, a year later is, the end of life.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:05:57\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yemaya, would you... encourage innovators to develop multi core computers, and taking them through certification, ground up, or are you a proponent of taking whatever is best of breed in the commercial world and somehow running it through the cert process?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:06:15\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, it's not really possible to take, a consumer electronic device, and get the higher DALs, it starts, let me take that back, you have to have an insane amount of information that most consumer electronics companies don't, that information doesn't even exist because they don't test for certain things. and so it is very difficult to start with, a consumer electronics device and meet high DALs. And certification starts from day one and from the ground up and there are many companies, by the way, that are developing, rugged, certifiable computers. There's an entire ecosystem that has been created in the last 10 to 15 years that's fully dedicated to developing these systems and I say that's one area where you should just work with the existing ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:11\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How do you think that autonomy and certification of AI and MCPs change the existing value chain in avionics and how value is distributed. How do you think that the Avionics value chain will be disrupted?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:07:28\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is a great question. We're seeing a good amount of this across the tech industry as a whole. And, in this market today, it's the avionics OEMs and the air framers who are relied upon to drive innovation, but they are relatively disincentivized to do it. Why? Because the investment for, commercializing, a certified product is so high. And then once you make that investment, you have to then focus on, maximizing your profit. And that means that your assembly lines have to be running nonstop, right? And so when you need to, I guess optimize for, filling your assembly lines, you're disincentivized to innovate because it requires more investment, and it eats into your ability to be profitable, in selling your systems, but what I'm seeing lately is that, this interesting shift is that tomorrow's operators and end users, they're starting to drive some demand for capabilities. They're starting to drive demand for, say, our system, PilotEye. We're finding that it's the operators that are saying, we want this, and we want you to deliver this. And, we're working along the value chain in a way that we didn't expect to be operating along the value chain and traditionally they would apply pressure on the air framer in the avionics OEM in order to integrate and we're seeing some very interesting cases where, they're saying, no, I'm just going to work with you directly. I think one example could be, let's see, Air Methods with Skyrise, right? And in, in that way, I mean that, this is not something, a deal that's including Garmin. It's not a deal that's including the air framer. This is a company that is, delivering directly to, an operator. I think that is relatively new. now how we see this shifting the value as well is, I think that in driving in this direction, this trend, it is potentially going to lead to the hardware, essentially being democratized in a way that the value becomes the software versus the hardware. One example is that there was a time where in operations, just having a camera was huge you had all this additional situational. awareness with a specific kind of camera. Now, once you apply artificial intelligence to it, suddenly the operator's like, No, it's the AI. It's the insights that are delivered from the AI that's where all the value is. And, I think that this is going to be an interesting next, decade in seeing how the traditional avionics OEMs and airframers react to this. another example in consumer electronics is, everyone's, PC, at least ones that have Intel people have a sticker that says Intel inside. No one knows why that even matters, right? So people know Intel because they knew the sticker that was on their computer. but where they saw the value was in Microsoft, right? they see the value in Microsoft. They see the value in Apple, which is, mostly, on the OS and the applications that are built on top of the OS, but not realizing that there are certain functions, For instance, remember when there was a time where you would be typing up a paper on Microsoft Word and your computer goes out and you are screwed. You've lost everything if you did not do a save, right? It was a function in the silicon that enabled the software, to do continuous saves, move, a current instance into, non volatile memory and keep that such that when you turn your computer back on, you can go and get your document. Well, that, that was the Intel inside that, that enabled that. and I think that we're driving in a direction that might look the same way on, the, avionics side and then aerospace side.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:45\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, my question, you can answer or not answer any of these questions, but is 80 percent of your revenue today coming from GA\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:53\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:54\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And two three, four years from now, how will that change?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:11:58\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it'll still be mostly GA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And 10 years from now, what percentage of revenue do you think will be from advanced air mobility?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:06\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, 10 years from now, Advanced Air Mobility? it will be larger than the first five years? Haha, it, that's a good question. again, I think, I do believe this goes back to our first question, that, it, we, there will be revenue that is because of advanced air mobility. In fact, I think that if we are successful, it'll be a large amount and, by successful, I mean, that we are directly addressing the cost, we're directly addressing the, resource efficiency and able, to introduce systems that, are commercially viable because there is some level of automation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:12:51\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In order for us to get to level 4 and 5 and DAL A and B, what's the greatest limiting factor? Is it your ability to be able to create the capabilities to be at level 4 or 5? Or are there other factors that you think would be limitations?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:13:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I... I don't know that it's necessarily a technological problem. I do think that it's a regulatory issue. There's also parts of it that is, even a perception problem. so many people think AI and they think Terminator. And, we're like, you can also use AI to do boring stuff, just identify non cooperative traffic, right? And so... It's the responsibility of folks like Daedalean, and we're taking this on directly. It's our responsibility to, not, integrate AI and applications that just don't need it, right? And for PilotEye... If it's cooperative traffic, it outputs ADS B. That's great, right? But we provide additional, value in using the AI just for non cooperative traffic. use the technology very wisely and where things are working, take advantage of that. We do believe that, AI enhanced autonomy is the best chance of operating, in environments that are not so constrained that they might completely eat away your economic viability in a way that your operational constraints are so great that you can't scale or, you can only operate for these very specific con ops that turn out to, oh, by the way, they are, low margin or low volume, or they don't scale themselves. Right. So we try to really pay attention to that. And, we take the approach of where there is a technology that exists and it works, we want to do that. And we start with how can AI augment that and support that to ensure that, it enables, more freedom in the way that you can operate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:14:55\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>5, 10, 15 years from now, paint a picture, if you could briefly, just paint a picture of the level 4, level 5 automation, what's a high probability future look like?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:07\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, there will be cases of level four automation in very constrained operating environments. in 10 years, I think that there will be, less constraints, possibly still mostly fixed route, automation, in some specific con ops, and potentially there might be one or two con ops that, are fully autonomous, again, in very constrained, operating environment. 15 years, I think that's closer where we start seeing some real scale and commercial viability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:15:48\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you're saying, at the same time, that's probably the future of autonomy for advanced air mobility as well, and you're saying that's the viability of advanced air mobility on the same timeline, given your initial\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:01\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>comments. Right. the tech needs to be proven out and, our company, we're proving out the tech in today's airspace in GA, we don't take the approach that automation and autonomy is an all or nothing, kind of proposition. We say that, we can address this by, leveraging the technology in today's airspace in, limited ways, augmenting the, human pilot in, some ways that then by the time, Urban Air Mobility is ready to scale the technology has also been proven out and has had years of certification credit in order to be proven out and then integrated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:41\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Can Daedalean meet its financial objectives at just level one and two levels of automation in the next five years?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Yemaya:\u003C/cite> \u003Ctime>1:16:50\u003C/time>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I believe so.

And there is a commercial need for that, right? We have IP, that we are developing all so that we can just deliver, the, machine learn systems.
