Everything else is fundamentally limited, either from the technology, infrastructure, market applicability, or safety and regulation sides. And hybrid threads the needle perfectly right now. And everything else you have to place a bet on an unknown that's completely out of your control. Whether it's battery energy density or hydrogen costs or infrastructure. And hybrid doesn't place any uncontrollable bets. It's just about good execution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Kevin Noertker Co-founder and CEO of Ampaire. For those of you who've been listening to many of our last several podcasts discussions, especially those with Rob Britton and Jeff Luckett, you'll find our discussion with Kevin a perfect follow on. After discussing areas where some may disagree with Kevin, we launch into an overview of electric aviation. And the industry that blossomed due to its introduction. Kevin also discusses that the electric-only industry hasn't seen the battery progress that many had hoped, which has pushed back the timelines of many fully dedicated electric vehicles. We also discuss how electric only vehicles especially eVTOL have more limited near term use cases. We then talk about hybrid propulsion versus electric propulsion. We discuss what parts of hybrid propulsion are changing the fastest today, and it's different and unique use cases. We then discuss why an operator in regional air mobility would select an electric vehicle versus what some would consider the more obvious choice of hybrid electric propulsion. We delve a bit deeper into regional air mobility and how overall electrification may increase the use of regional air mobility. We discuss the pluses and minuses of pure electrification hybrid and traditional aircraft on regional air mobility as well. Kevin wraps up our discussion with some great advice for our innovators and entrepreneurs. Kevin, thanks for joining us for a terrific discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Kevin Noertker, as you profitably innovate in The Vertical Space. Kevin Noertker is co-founder and CEO of Ampaire. Over the past eight years, Kevin and his team have pioneered practical, compelling electrified flight through the upgrade of existing aircraft types. In 2019, they flew the world's largest hybrid electric aircraft. In 2020 and 2021 they deployed and demonstrated electrified flight with multiple airlines across the globe. With over 23,000 miles flown hybrid and 12 plus regulatory flight approvals across three countries to date, they're a leader in hybrid electric aviation. Prior to Ampaire, Kevin contributed engineering and program management expertise to advanced aircraft and satellite technology development programs at Northrop Grumman and as a research fellow at Caltech and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An entrepreneur at heart, Kevin is driven to apply the science and engineering disciplines of large aerospace organizations to pressing environmental problems here on Earth.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, Kevin, welcome.

The first is, we're in sustainable aviation and there's a lot of talk about new design planes and new markets, eVTOL and, high speed new design jets. And first is, I believe that we need to start with propulsion rather than airframe design. And there's a whole lot of good that you can do with new airframe designs, but novel propulsion is how we've seen these transformative moments progress in the past, whether that's the dawn of powered flight or the jet age. And I think you need to get the propulsion right before you start doing the transformative vehicle designs. There'll be a lot of people out there that might disagree with me on that one. Number two is that,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, I'll just, if I could jump in. I had a very senior transportation leader call me last week and say exactly\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>that's great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After listening to so many of our podcasts, he called me up and said, I want to talk about propulsion. And then I, as we were preparing for this, I was thinking, Oh, wow, this is perfect timing. So at least there's one person out there who agrees\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I appreciate that. Well, he and I should grab coffee sometime. I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp>great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And to add this strikes me as perhaps more commonly held view than perhaps you are alluding to. All the new technology waves in aviation revolve around or are enabled by new propulsion. So what is it about this particular statement that, the industry disagrees with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's the idea that you need to do the new airframe design with the new propulsion in the first embodiment. Ampaire over the years has gotten a lot of pushback from industry stakeholders about doing upgrades of existing aircraft types. But you can't capture the full opportunity, they say, by upgrading an existing plane, you really need distributed electric propulsion, or you need the new airflow augmentation, or your vertical lift features, and that they believe that those features are going to drive the adoption dynamic, and that propulsion retrofits which is the path Ampaire has taken, is not a sufficient starting place. I think that's where the differentiation comes in. Because certainly eVTOL, let's take as an example, requires novel propulsion. what I'm saying is we can decouple those as a first step. Not to belittle the benefits that you would get from a clean sheet design, or maybe it's ultra short takeoff and landing performance. But the fact that designing a plane around propulsion that is not yet certified, that does not yet exist, is a recipe for having to redesign that plane half a dozen times. And we've already seen people burn a lot of capital going through that path this turn of the wheel. But if you just look in history, I mean, this is new design planes that didn't do it around existing propulsion. That's one of the big gotchas in the, in the design space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And there was another thing that you wanted to flag.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This is going one layer down there for propulsion. Hybrid electric is the only approach that makes sense right now. There are many exciting technologies. Obviously, fully electric is a dream many of us have. There's some corner cases where fully electric might work. There are a lot of people pushing hydrogen, but the reality is just like on the ground. Hybrid electric is going to lead, it is the gateway technology to this future. And I think it's going to be the gateway technology for decades.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I didn't expect a different answer from you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'm talking about, anything with commercial relevance, where operating flexibility, that is range, payload, airports that you can fly to and from, anywhere in the economics, anywhere that matters, and you need to get to scale, hybrid electric is what'll get you there.

And everything else you have to place a bet on an unknown that's completely out of your control. Whether it's battery energy density or hydrogen costs or infrastructure. And, and hybrid doesn't place any uncontrollable bets. It's just about good execution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, elaborate on this point a little bit. Why is it that the industry doesn't think that hybrid is the way to go?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think back to when we founded Ampaire. And I think back to a lot of the people in this industry who have such deep passion for making a positive impact on the world around us. And those core motivations for many are about usually one of two things. Either they care deeply about the environment and they want a true zero emissions solution. And that forces their designs into a fully electric or, a strong hybrid where you're flying fully electric for some period of time, or a hydrogen where they can claim a, zero carbon emissions in flight, if it's a fuel cell. And so what you see is this desire to have a pure carbon, remedy. And that causes people to not prefer the hybrid electric type approaches or these hybrid approaches where, you know, 50 percent fuel savings, 50 to 70 percent in our vehicles is phenomenal, but it's not zero. And if you're here on only principle and unwilling to look at anything but the pure solution, then that would bias you against it. The second is, there are some people who are pushing toward this idea of you have to start with the absolute simplest, simplest possible architecture, even if it's not possible today. And electric is phenomenally simple. And the maintenance costs are super low, and in theory you can get the economics to play out, depending on your battery assumptions. And if you believe, if you have certain optimisms in that area, then you don't want to give yourself the complexity or the crutch of having to do the partial via hybrid solution. And I think that keeps some people away from it because they say, oh, batteries will get there. Like, let's just wait around for those. But I think they miss the point that if you can serve, 10 times the market size by using hybrid electric, and you're saving half the fuel burn on that. That's, do the math, it's five times the positive impact of a few or zero emissions on that one tenth of a market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Let's talk about electric aviation. Zoom out a little bit, catch us up on some of the major milestones in electric aviation over the last several years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, electric aviation has had some pretty amazing progress in the last decade or so. The earliest companies in this industry were founded in the, 2010s but very few were talking about them at that point in time. You had the starting of, the NASA X 57 program. By the time Ampaire was founded in 2016, there still really weren't that many companies that were publicly acknowledged doing work in this space. Since then, we've seen this, this, blossoming of ideas, of concepts, I remember, the first time, I think, Peter, you were, you might have even been there at the, Uber Elevate Conference out in Dallas in 2017. There's this industry that built up around the enthusiasm for electrification. And then you saw hundreds, I believe the number peaked at over 700 different projects in this space. A lot of ideas, a lot of people who really get excited about designing airplanes. And, want to go through the features. So, big milestones. You've had first flights, whether those are the flights of the Pipistrel Alpha Electro, or ultimately that being delivered to customers around the world. You have the first flights of various development program aircraft, Ampaire's first flight in 2019, and, subsequent iterations, for example, our, Caravan flight in, 2022. The industry's also made progress from, simple demonstration of flight capability to very specific capabilities. So in eVTOL, the progress of transitioning from vertical lift to fixed wing flight has been a, a big challenge where still only a handful of companies have safely made that transition or done so with a pilot on board. These are critical milestones that will drive confidence in adoption and ability to gain regulatory approvals on the, on the operations. You've seen some incremental progress along the battery energy density. standpoint, so a lot of folks are waiting for batteries to have significantly higher watt hours per kilogram, so the gravimetric energy density in the lithium ion batteries in particular. And we've seen some modest progress on that and some really amazing announcements. Some groups who are in the chemistry side trying to, get up toward, past 500 watt hours per kilogram, targeting 1, 000 watt hours per kilogram, pretty audacious goals. I think, the industry hasn't yet seen, as significant of progress as many had hoped, and that's, that's pushing back timelines for entry into service of the fully electric, fully electric vehicles. And then from a certification standpoint, some pretty big milestones. Back to 2018, where we were kicking off a ASTM committee around electric vehicle chargers, through all the SAE committees or other industry groups working together on certification. While these might not be the visible milestones that hit the press, there's certainly the milestones and progress that help move the industry forward. And so, watching folks get their first certification bases established, or get a, get means of compliance agreed upon, or special conditions, moving forward, ultimately looking, I think here in the next few years, we'll get the first full, regulatory approvals for commercial operation. And, and each of those are some of the very meaningful milestones that are, happening real time and coming up soon.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the surprises for me was, the lack of certification events following Pipistrel's EASA certification of their, Velis Electro aircraft in the LSA category that was back in the summer of 2020. And then earlier this year, I think in March, the FAA issued an LSA airworthiness exemption for that same aircraft. But here we are four years later and no other electric aircraft has been certified. Why do you think that's the case? What's the bottleneck? about the.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think the, there are a few things. One is, the regulatory basis for certification. And the Pipistrel products didn't fully open up the Part 23 or the vertical lift, certification arena. it was in a different category initially. And I think that while it made progress and maybe others could have taken their products through that same, the, you know, the identical regulatory pathway, many of the products that are out there that we most were paying attention to are in Part 23 or the vertical lift category, which was not as fully opened up through the Pipistrel application. Think second was a bit of the dynamics in the market, so with the pandemic in 2020, I think a lot of milestones were dragged out a bit. 2021, money was easy, and I think that meant that money went to moonshots. So easy money doesn't mean it goes to practical, near term, near term wins. And so I think that a lot of the money that was being invested in late 2020 and throughout 2021 was going toward long horizon plays. So purposefully not aiming at super near term strategies. And I think that overfunded those, and we've seen many get significant funding, but then burning through it, and I think it underfunded the pragmatic strategies. and so what you saw was further pressures on or delays to the timelines for entry into service for those that might not have been as flashy, but were, were just making the, the next increment of meaningful progress. And then we've seen the retrenchment of the markets where now there's a bit of a recoil. I think, the industry's at risk of losing credibility. Given all the claims that were made and failed to be lived up to, whether that's certain timelines, or product performance, or cost metrics for the products. And so, I think the industry, in particular the capital allocators, may be licking their wounds from those moonshot projects that didn't play out, which doesn't help again those that are near term. What it does is it pulls back more capital away from everything, and so if you're looking at that as a lowering tide, each of these dynamics I think is has pressed away from certification milestones that we might have otherwise hoped to see more rapidly after the Pipistrel's early successes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what about the maturity of the enabling technologies themselves and the certifiability of the motors and batteries. What's the status there? And I was recently catching up with another founder and we started talking about this and it was surprising to hear how the regulatory bodies are trying to apply traditional propulsion system requirements to electric motors. So for instance, I think there's a requirement somewhere in internal combustion engines that they need to be able to run for, I think it's five minutes in max rated power, whereas an electric motor reaches its thermal limit, a lot quicker, maybe within, two minutes or so before needing to throttle back. And so that is one contentious issue, allegedly as is the example of having dual magnetos in ICE engines, and does that translate into, you know, double architecture in electric motors, all of that increasing mass, increasing budget, and really not making that cost equation as favorable as initially expected. Do you have any insights into those aspects of how the bottlenecks are being tackled at the certifiability and the maturity of the technologies?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think that this gets to one of the really critical and core risks in the industry, which is the supply chain and the ability to not just invent something, but to produce it reliably many times at a good economics. That's really what builds the markets here. I think the regulatory bodies are trying to adapt to what they know. And, those adaptations, whether it's the Part 23 rewrite, which adapted combustion type expectations to, an opener, larger net for what kind of technologies could actually be used to meet those requirements. But in the details, they're still looking for that familiarity. So what's your mean time between failure? How long can you run at full power? What are the failure modes and effects, and making sure that you're going through the detail on that? This is the, the specifics that you get into when putting together your program certification plan, your means of compliance, or ultimately going through the testing for your, Type Certificate or STC, and it is, it's really where the rubber hits the road in the industry. I don't think that all the answers are there yet. I think there are the early entrance, certainly Ampaire is, at least to our knowledge, the only company working on a hybrid electric propulsion system certification program actively with the FAA. And so this means that we are, we're clearing many of those open questions actively with them and collaboratively with them. It also means that we have, expectations upon our supply chain that, emerge over time if something, for example, with the FAA, brings up or highlights a requirement that we did not expect. As you talked about with the motors. for these questions about redundancy, there's what you could expect as a technologist, like you'd understand the technology and you believe this to be true, some level of safety, let's say, but that does not mean that will be accepted on the first pass through certification. And in fact, I think that the first paths through certification are going to be relatively risk averse and risk managed in those setting a higher bar for redundancy, not giving you credit for levels of safety that you think you might deserve. So, case in point, for the lithium ion batteries, no matter what you do to the cells, no matter how you package those cells into your modules, no matter what physical, interconnect or disconnect controls you have that might mitigate thermal runaway, or physical barriers that might mitigate propagation or software layers that are on top of all of that. The belts and suspenders and layers of safety. At the end of the day, the FAA, probably rightly so at this stage, requires you to show that you have physical barriers that if you force the battery into thermal runaway, the vehicle will be safe. So you don't get, you don't get actual credit for everything below that. You need ultimate safety and then all the other stuff that you thought was going to be sufficient. And these are, again, I don't think it should be surprising to anybody that the earliest, earliest applications, we're going to take a, the most risk managed approach. But what it means is that when you're a battery engineer on your fully electric vehicle, you're now doubling the weight of all these additional systems when you thought you could get there just with a really good BMS algorithm. And so what it drives is the decisions and it drives the, ultimately the designs into corners that might not be viable given some of those early assumptions. This is why we pushed again toward hybrid electric, because with a battery pack, a third the size of a Tesla pack and able to take on the extra weight and the payload hit along with it for all these physical layers of safety, we still have phenomenal performance on our system. and I think that these are, these are areas where the industry is trying to navigate alongside the regulations to mature, the solutions and the risk, together.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, what electric aircraft are selling in meaningful numbers today that you're impressed by?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you say stelling, I'm gonna assume you mean where there's a cash transaction and somebody ends up with an airplane. in their hangar at the end of it, and right now the only airplanes that are selling, are the Pipistrel aircraft at this time. There are many organizations placing orders, pre orders for, eventual deliveries, but at this stage, very minimal on the actual sales in this market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Kevin, what are you seeing as the FAA's thought process for how industry is going to incorporate improvements in hybrid electric propulsion systems into these aircraft in the coming years. These aircraft are long lived assets. Batteries still seem to be improving pretty markedly over the years. Motor technology as well. So if you certify something, on the one hand, you're locked in at that point in time, are they going to use an STC method for bringing improvements in? Or is there something that is even more fluid for allowing that, that they have in mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's a really good point because the technology base is moving so much faster than the time scale of a vehicle life, right? These aircraft last 40 years. And the, batteries are improving on the, on the order of every two to three years, you'd expect people wanting an upgrade of their battery pack to the next generation, a little bit like people might want their new iPhone every few years. The way you go about certifying your product matters. And if you wrap everything into the type certificate, then you need to amend or update the type certificate when anything changes. And so that would require a supplemental type certificate for certain types of changes. Generally, propulsion systems, propellers, or airframe changes require a new type certificate, or a amendment, or a STC, supplemental type certificate. There are things you can change on an airplane without having to go get an STC. You could replace a conforming part with an equivalent part. You're able to show certain equivalent levels of safety. And so there are efforts to try to find ways that these components which would be replaced over time, let's use the batteries as an example. Batteries degrade over the cycles of use, and every few years you want to replace those. You have to go get an STC for the new battery pack are you able to use a TSO type of process? Basically a lighter version of those approvals. And it really depends on exactly how that battery pack was incorporated into the vehicle level certification. So is it part of the engine? Is it part of the aircraft? Is it a safety of flight critical component? And then as technology improves, One of the things in aviation is you lock yourself into the parts that you designed and that an in any change in that part requires a change in your regulatory approval. So as batteries improve, how do you go through that certification pathway? Again, generally, what I think the industry will see is we guarantee equivalent performance while providing improved performance. And that all you're doing when you're meeting the existing regulatory waterline is you're saying we're at least as good as we were previously, and we haven't changed any flight characteristics. The question will be, when do you want to take credit for that? When do you want to allow the operator to plan a longer route? You can give them more energy, which gives them more safety, or maybe it gives them more flexibility on how many, how many flight miles they can perform or when they need to recharge at the other end. But it might not be part of the underlying. certification, performance capability of the vehicle that you've, that you've sought from the regulatory body. Now, this is a nuance, but it's the difference between having to go through the full cert program for the new tech or just increasing performance but taking credit for an equivalent level of safety. One specific point here, in our hybrid system, I have triplicate redundancy in our hybrids. We are phenomenally safe, and I believe safer than a traditional combustion engine would be, where it's a single point failure for the traditional engine. And in our, in Ampaire's system, we have redundancy, two layers of redundancy in the combustion engine. And then also this independent electric system, which is able to carry you further as well. But am I going to get credit for anything more than a single engine capability? Probably not. and that's understandable, at least initially. And I think over time, what people, what you'll get is additional credit for those things from the regulatory body. And in the interim, when new tech, motors, or batteries come out, It'll be at equivalent levels of safety as what was there previously.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What components of the hybrid electric propulsion system are changing the fastest right now, be it the battery systems, the motors themselves, power electronics, or something else? What do you see as the fastest changing or evolving?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, the fastest changing components historically have been those which had the benefit of riding the coattails of other industries. Aviation, as big as we love it and believe it is, is much smaller than, as a market driver, than other forms of ground transportation. And so we have been the recipients of rapid technology improvement across lithium ion batteries as energy density, volume density and cost get brought down. The, the motors have been a, truly the underlying enabling factor in many of these cases. So the power density of motors is pretty phenomenal compared to where it was a decade ago. And we still see companies that are, and we work closely with companies that are pioneering in this space. And you can start, you're getting great efficiencies and really high, power density out of these motors. Where, certainly Ampaire has locked most of the components for our launch product, but we have a flying testbed where we're able to bring in new technologies, where we first flew a silicon carbide inverter, when we have brought in new motors, inverters, and energy storage tech. And it's really in those, the motors and batteries that most people are pushing firmly for innovation, and then a bit in the efficiency of the power electronics, but a lot of that currently is, seems like it's lab scale technology. And while our work with ARPA E and NASA enables us to make that move even faster, I hesitate to, to think that lab technology today is going to rapidly enter commercialization anytime soon. I think we've seen a consistent trend that timelines for those developments take much longer than, than the, the technology teams would, would have originally anticipated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is aviation going to continue to benefit from advances in the automotive industry around the batteries that they use? Or is there going to be a fork in the road where the needs of aviation diverge from what the auto industry is pushing towards?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, the auto industry used to have range anxiety. But then battery energy density got to the point that you can drive hundreds of miles. There's a sufficient charging network. So I don't see the energy density being what automotive is optimizing for anymore. Really, I think automotive is going to continue optimizing for cost, and we've seen that over the last few years. Bringing the cost of an EV down is the driver for adoption more than bringing the range up. Whereas in aviation, we're still in that bringing the range up is the requirement. And so this is a divergence in the optimization goals for the technology coming out of automotive. Now the question would be, even if the goals are different, is the state of the art, the state of knowledge and capability, is that going to improve? As folks go toward lower cost, are we going to also see emergent benefits for aviation? Absolutely. As people do innovation and build new types of electric machines, it's no longer just about what is Tesla using in a Roadster, it's about where the larger vehicles, your mid duty and heavy duty trucks, what are the power requirements for those vehicles. What are the energy densities required for those? And so it's this expanding fringe of requirements that I think will also drive a, an alignment in, in, in emerging technologies with what aviation is looking for. But the core of a ground car is, is less likely to directly align with aviation than it did over the last decade in my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Are the batteries that you would design around for your hybrid electric conventional takeoff and landing airplane, are they the same ones that you would design around for a VTOL aircraft? And the reason I ask is that, an additional difference that I've, come to appreciate with batteries for VTOL aircraft is the power output demand on them, especially requiring high power output at the end of the flight as the aircraft transitions back into vertical flight to make its approach at the landing pad. That's a particularly, stringent requirement on the battery system. For what you're doing, I don't know, maybe that still exists. Maybe it's the same battery. Maybe you, you can, use the same tech, but how do you think about that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a nuance that most of the world, unlike you, Peter, most of the world doesn't catch the nuance between the different types of batteries. The power density versus the energy density needs to be tailored for the application. And what's interesting is you gave two examples. I'll add one more in there around fully electric airplanes. So let's take your eVTOL, which is fully electric, but requires huge amounts of power at a low state of charge at the end of flight, right? So you need a power cell there. Then you have a fully electric airplane, which has a large amount of batteries. And so actually a relatively low C rate, especially if it's conventional takeoff and landing. You're not really draining where, for those listening, the C rate is the rate of charge or discharge. as a proportion of the total pack size. And so that, when you have a really large pack, relative to your pack size, you're not discharging that rapidly. And so those can be energy cells, because you don't really need that high power C rate. But then you go to a hybrid electric plane. And as I mentioned, our pack is about a third the size of a Tesla pack. These are pretty small, actually. When you come through our hangar, you see this battery is big enough to fly a Caravan, really. And that is because in a hybrid, you use the battery differently than you would in the fully electric. A small battery pack, but you still have pretty high power for takeoff and climb. Again, now you need a higher C rate. You need more of a power cell. And so for each application, you do actually have different requirements for the type of the type of chemistry you might consider, the, tailoring of that cell between energy and power, certainly the life cycle economics of the pack, the degradation over time, you might have great power or great energy, but if you only cycle 400 times, then are you useful? There's a, there's, there are all these pieces that go into the details of selecting a battery. And this is the challenge that some companies who are trying to do a one size fits all, cell or module for everybody, need to hit the high waterline or miss the, miss the mark on their, their certain markets. And this is again, why I think it's so important to have a more flexible design where let's say that I need to increase the size of my pack a little bit because I'm not getting exactly what I wanted out of my supply chain, where we can handle that. it's not ideal. We don't desire it, but when you have a, an approach, which is just a little bit more flexible than, the pure heart requirement, I think most eVTOL folks. A lot of the ones who have decided to in house their battery development is because they realize they will not get precisely what they need from anyone else, and they have to tailor it directly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Given the advantages of the hybrid propulsion to electric, why would the eVTOL or the electric plane companies go purely electric versus hybrid? What would be some of their rationale?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Number one is, that I hear from them is on the emissions. They want to be able to say they can operate fully zero emissions. Number two is a statement around, around complexity, the economics of maintenance and that's a, it's an interesting argument which, without being deep into the weeds, it's hard to validate or, dispute. All the weeds that I've been in have shown that fully electric still has a way to go before it's economically more viable. But those are usually why I see, that it can, there are other ancillary features, like, for example, noise characteristics are important for communities. Oftentimes the reason communities get upset with aviation is because of the noise. And hybrid electric does not fully eliminate the noise profile, to the extent that full, that fully electric does. Fully electric planes, if you've ever flown in one, it's like being in a glider a lot of the time. It's really beautiful. and I think that some people have hung their hats on the sound, and frankly, to their credit, if you're an eVTOL talking about flying to the city center of Manhattan, you better be thinking about sound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's not how people are going to scale in the next several years. At the end of the day, regional air mobility most likely is how a vehicle is going to scale in the next, let's face it, 5 to 10 years. And given regional air mobility, given the requirements of the vehicles, I'm guessing that hybrid is going to be the, the limitations of hybrid are not nearly as impactful as they would be if they go into city center. And how many city center flights are going to be occurring in the next five to ten years, and especially at scale. So my guess is a lot of people right now listening are saying, hybrid's the way to go. Why would they not be saying that, especially as we start to talk about regional air mobility?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so it depends on who they are. Let's say that you are an eVTOL developer. We know many. And you've spent the last half a decade, investing how many hundreds of millions of dollars into your pure electric design. That is tailored, that every inch of it is optimized specifically for your fully electric operation. You don't have volume, you don't have weight, you would have to redesign your plane in order to integrate a hybrid electric system. And I know this because I've worked with those groups, and we have shown that you can apply a hybrid electric system in. But shoehorning a hybrid into a combustion plane is one thing, that's where we enter the market. Shoehorning a hybrid into something which was designed for a little battery pack, is a completely different beast. And I think a lot of these developers have gotten so deep into their fully electric application that they don't have the payload and volume capacity to take on the hybrid electric into their current designs. And so,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But let's move on. Let's say, Kevin, sorry, great answer, but let's talk about the operators who are going to be purchasing these vehicles. Why would they consider a fully, let's again, let's step into regional air mobility. Why would they consider a fully electric plane with its, with some of its limitations? Obviously some pluses, but the hybrid I would assume is still less noisy, for example, than a traditional combustion engine. Why would they consider a fully electric plane rather than a hybrid for regional air mobility in the next 5 to 10 years? What's their rationale? Put yourself in the position of an operator who has to make that decision.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so I would ask, what's the risk? Am I, what, truly, what's the risk? The risk that I put down an order? Even if it's binding, I'm sure there are tons of outs that if it, if this doesn't meet my performance requirements, I don't have to buy it. And probably if I'm putting money down, it's going into an escrow that it can come back to me. Most aren't putting money down for the fully electric, type orders that are out there. And so I would look at it and say, I could place an order for a fully electric plane and if it doesn't pan out, great. If all of the Swiss cheese of good things going right doesn't occur, I probably got a boost to my marketing and brand along the way, and I'm not out any money at the end of the day, I could probably still buy a hybrid down the road. Now, the reality is a lot of these groups are falling behind in our order books, so, potentially they won't be as, as, as early as they would like, but if magic happens and the performance is what people would love electric to be, then I get the electric plane and everything that I needed. And so I think it's a risk posture that, the benefit of placing a signaling order outweighs the risk. And the key for me, as Kevin and with my Ampaire hat on, is those folks still place orders for hybrids. Right? Like, when I talk to folks, they're like, Kevin, this is the first thing that I actually have confidence is going to come to market. I'm going to place an order for this. And what's silly is some of those people still say, and by the way, we don't want to talk publicly about this because our brand is still like fully zero emissions, but we know that this is probably going to come in first. And so we'd like to take part in it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, in what way is certifying a hybrid configuration easier or more difficult compared to certifying a battery electric?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the hybrid, one of the reasons it's easier is the safety case. The safety case for our system in the, condition where you assume you have an issue with the electric vehicle system, which is really what is the novel, parts of the technology. If you're in a hybrid electric condition like ours, you fall back onto a combustion engine and you fly home safely. We have full cruise capacity. With our combustion engine, so there's no degradation or risk to that operation if you shut off the electric system in flight. You can't say that for a fully electric, or hydrogen, for example, system that, when you have an issue, maybe you have redundancy in the battery packs, but the level of safety that you can, that you can, take credit for in the hybrid is quite a bit higher. And, and certifying that is, is we believe going to be faster and lower complexity and lower cost than going fully electric. The second is around the size and, requirements on each of the subcomponents. So whether it's the batteries or the motors, when you look at the reduced consequence of an issue, you can also, take different or take a different balance on the, the probability of certain issues occurring. And, and so the holistic risk analysis for the, the safety case, we have a little bit more flexibility. And that means that flexibility translates into the supply chain and our ability to move a bit more quickly and getting those, getting those technologies through the certification program.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the expected efficiency gain of a hybrid electric conventional aircraft versus the efficiency gain that we are seeing from hybrid electric automobiles? And is there a difference? And if so, why? And then we can get into efficiency gain that you would see from just like retrofitting an existing airplane versus designing an airplane around hybrid electric. Especially for the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft because going to electric propulsion when you want to do distributed electric propulsion for vertical flight or for electric STOL, okay, we get that, right? There's a capability there that's earning its way onto the aircraft. But if you are going for conventional takeoff and landing, and you are looking for an efficiency gain, what can we expect to see?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the efficiency of these hybrid systems, and I, I see hybrid as this gateway technology that as the underlying technology improves directionally toward fully electric, all of it will first get proven out in these hybrid electric systems, conditions. One of the, one of the great drivers for adoption of hybrid electric is the fuel efficiency of the systems that, that we and have already demonstrated and have been flying tens of thousands of miles so far in our hybrid systems and demonstrated a 50% fuel burn reduction. During takeoff and climb cycle, we're up closer to 70 percent fuel burn reduction. So these are actual measurements, right? This is not just an Excel spreadsheet model. This is empirical data and is the kind of benefit that you can get in certain embodiments of hybrid electric systems. So this is, pretty, pretty significant fuel savings, even when you're looking at the, the opportunity of hybrid-electric on the ground, where, call it maybe a 40 percent fuel savings, to 50 percent fuel savings on the ground. And it's all about the specific architecture of the system that drives the beneficial economics. Fuel is one of the largest, if not the largest, operating cost for most airlines. And so the fuel burn reduction then drives a positive cycle for the economic viability of new routes and market growth and higher frequencies of service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What phase of flight are these efficiencies realized the most?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, if you're just looking at a pure percentage basis of fuel savings, takeoff and climb is where you're getting the biggest boost from the electric system in our current architecture. There are lots of different hybrid architectures, and we've got a few of them, but what we're launching into product, into market with is a integrated parallel hybrid architecture where we use the electric system effectively as a boost during the high power phases of flight and the combustion engine as a baseline load of power for the cruise and, and across the rest of the flight. So you get up to 70 percent fuel savings, during that takeoff and climb cycle. And then it levels off toward about 50 percent fuel savings during the cruise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I see. What's the state of the art in some of the metrics on the battery side? We talked a little bit about, well, we didn't talk numbers, but gravimetric specific energy density, both at the cell and the pack level, the cycle life that state of the art batteries are achieving, and the, battery pack cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the, the batteries, so watt hours per kilogram is the metric that we in the industry normally uses to measure the energy density. The target most are aiming for is right around 400 watt hours per kilogram at a pack level. We're not close to that today. When you're looking at the packs today, you're at, right around 200 watt hours per kilogram really depends on your cooling system and where you draw the dotted line on the battery pack itself and what you include as weight versus don't include as kind of wet versus dry weight for the pack. The cells themselves, are, I remember a few years ago seeing cells that were cresting through the 200s of watt hours per kilogram, and then you get folks who are talking about 300, even into the 400 watt hour per kilogram cells. I think I've seen announcements about cells that are even significantly higher than that. Unfortunately, I'm not an expert in the kind of the lab type chemistry that goes into these batteries and the art of understanding where along the long tail of getting from lab into production you are and in measuring the number of years remaining is very challenging. And so it's hard to tell what, like, state of the art for, for the development of new technologies sounds like it's pretty far ahead in these high watt hours per kilogram. I think the reality is the first battery packs that get adopted into market are going to be at a pack level, maybe even sub 200 watt hours per kilogram, when you're looking full scope, full scope weight of the system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And in terms of cycle life and cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Cycle life and cost are, generally tailored depending on what your application are. So if you've got a more exotic cell, a higher power or energy density, it'll probably have a lower cycle life. I've heard some of our industry peers talking about cycle lives less than a thousand cycles. I don't see how that makes a whole lot of economic sense when you have to be replacing the batteries so, so repeatedly. We think that a 2, 000 to 3, 000 cycles, maybe it's 2, 000 full depth discharge, but you're looking at, you know, that might give you 4, 000 or 5, 000 actual flight cycles on a, on a vehicle, that's not unrealistic when you're not working with the most exotic type cells. And from a cost, I think, we're pretty conservative assuming costs are going to be pretty, pretty high, and it's hard to tell what'll come out in full production once you actually get to scale, but being at$500 per kilowatt hour, I think would be a great outcome for the industry if we were able to get there. And, I wouldn't be surprised if the very first battery packs that came to market were quite a, maybe a multiple higher than that. So maybe a thousand dollars per kilowatt hour. Which gets pretty expensive, especially when you're looking at the very large packs for, for the fully electric vehicles, but is still somewhat manageable with the, with the hybrid electric approach.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to put some business perspective into the conversation and if we use, uh, maybe we can get to ultimately the use case that you are pursuing at Ampaire, but one of the common near term use cases for electric aircraft is often thought of on the conventional side as a flight school trainer aircraft. Now, putting aside that the current range restrictions do not enable flight schools to use electric aircraft for the entirety of the curriculum for flight training, but for most, missions, it's good enough. What I'm interested in is when you actually go down into the weeds that you've been in, how the business case for an electric, fully battery powered aircraft pencils out when you consider the fact that, conventional piston engines are an industry that's been around for decades, benefiting from huge economies of scale, exceptional safety records, it's in the several thousands annual units, a lot of the development and R&amp; D costs have been recovered already. I mean, you're going after a relatively low cost. And I think the engine, replacement on, in this type application is in the 30, 40, 50. maybe 70, 000 per engine, correct me guys, uh, if I'm off. Uh, but at any rate, uh, you have that on the one hand, and then you have an electric, aircraft with a motor that, needs to recover the certification costs and development costs, and is one that every, you know, thousand cycles needs to replace the battery, which can be, I don't know, 80, 000 or whatever the cost is. So when you bake all of these different things, does it really become an attractive option?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So this gets back to your first question around what might the industry disagree with me on, and it is this principle that the economics must make sense in order for people to adopt the products. There are a lot of people out there who assume government subsidies will get us there, or people willing to pay a green premium. And while certain cases that might be true, to hit the scale of adoption that's required, you can't achieve it without really compelling economic benefits for the end user and buyer. So this example that you gave around the, the training, especially in these smaller airplanes, is a great one. The market makes so much sense. The direct operating cost seems so low when you're only taking into account the industrial power that you're using. It's cents on the dollar for OpEx. But when you look whole scale and you're comparing yourself against a, sub 100, 000 airplane with relatively low cost of capital, it's probably fully depreciated, and you're comparing that to a quarter million dollar new build plane that has these unknowns around the cost of batteries over time, or the cost of the infrastructure to charge. The economics are really called into question, especially before you get to full scale. And I think that's, rightly should be acknowledged as one of the big risks for adoption. The performance of the systems, especially in training, I think a blended fleet where, cross country flights might have to be in a hybrid or combustion, but fully electric can be done for the, a few touch and goes here or there, or just familiarization. That's, I think that's completely reasonable to solve the problem. But the economics, especially in smaller airplanes, are pretty challenging. When you look at the economics as you scale to larger planes, it similarly, anywhere that it's not an operator of, high frequency becomes challenging because to earn back the capital cost of the system, you really need high utilization. And, you're not generally going against an option which is a premium priced combustion versus a premium priced electric. It's probably a relatively low cost combustion versus a premium priced electric, and I think that will be a friction point for adoption for those types of applications.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, if you were to argue for a fully battery electric aircraft, what is the right initial use case that will generate this flywheel moment where it makes sense and it also is a good path to get to scale, which will have benefits down the road with economies of scale and the supply chain, et cetera, et cetera. What use case gets the industry going, if not flight training.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think the use case that gets the electrification industry going is using those technologies in full scale applications. So it's taking the exact same batteries, the motors, the power electronics, These certification bases, taking those and by applying them into the hybrid electric applications, you build the industry base. You build the production volumes. You solve those economic challenges tied in with the supply chain and the certification and the market's readiness to adopt. Tying in with the economics of the full scope view, you start to bring those costs down to a point where all of a sudden those same technologies, those same suppliers that are making batteries for the hybrid or making motors for the hybrid, when the economics of scale get to a point, those same suppliers will be the supply base for the fully electric applications where, the opportunities are vast for, where you might want to fly a fully electric plane, whether it's short hop island hopping for commercial cargo flights, commercial drones, or for eVTOL cargo, or for pilot training. There are a lot of areas where you might want the fully electric. And I think the way to get the industry to scale is by scaling the underlying components rather than scaling the end solution of fully electric. And that's when I talk about hybrid as this gateway technology, I truly believe I'm helping all the electric, maybe even helping some hydrogen out there. Like because we're maturing the industry, we're maturing the supply base and we're getting up to good economics, full scale marketability of these underlying technologies that ultimately can be packaged in the fully electric. And that's I think that's how you get there. In eight and a half years of every waking and sleeping moment thinking about it, this is the pathway that makes sense to me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We just had Rob Britton on a couple weeks ago, our last podcast, and he was talking about regional air mobility, and he was saying that it's conceivable that hybrid or electric aircraft will allow us to be able to get to locations that today are less profitable than using a purely combustion engine aircraft. Talk a little bit about that. I'm guessing that hybrid would be the only solution today, although he did mention, I believe, guys, a 30 passenger electric plane as a potential solution in the near future. But talk about the capabilities for hybrid electric for regional air mobility. What's the near term, long term solution from your perspective, Kevin?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I really enjoyed listening to the episode with Rob and his enthusiasm for regional hybrid electric. You can hear it coming through in the conversation. Love it. And the folks over at Heart who you mentioned a few times, you know doing some really interesting work in trying to open up the regional space. Also in that episode, he had mentioned that this regional space is kind of eroded over the years. I mean, with deregulation and things having to compete just on the economics, economics really didn't make sense to serve a lot of secondary or tertiary markets. And so the service to those markets has gone away. And, that demand still exists, it's just being served by ground transportation, people jumping in their cars instead of flying. If you were able to give an economic alternative, lower cost of operation, being the key adoption driver, then people would potentially choose to fly those routes instead of drive those routes. And I think he was spot on with that and the enthusiasm around regional air mobility. Two areas that I would disagree with the approach, though. One is there's a phenomenal difference between a 19 passenger plane and a 20 passenger plane. While it might look almost the same, it is categorically different, in the literal sense of it, is a different category of airplane between Part 23 and Part 33. And the idea that somebody will open up regional air mobility with a Part 25 plane that is something over 20 passengers, I think, is faulty logic there. I don't think it's going to be, Part 25 is not going to be ready for hybrid electric, fully electric, any novel system for quite some time. Now, I want it to be there, and we're certainly helping the industry get there, and there are companies betting their, livelihood on it, but this is where I would disagree with the approach because we believe Part 23 is where it has to start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, explain for the audience the nuances of the differences.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So there are two major categories for conventional airplanes. One category, which is under Part 23 of the regulations, governs all planes up to 19 passengers or the equivalent weight. Part 25 governs all airplanes, 20 passengers and above. And so when regulations are updated in the industry, they're updated for one category or the other, eventually both. The smaller aircraft category, Part 23, is already positioned with all of the legislation and regulation in place to adopt novel propulsion technologies. The larger category is not in that state yet. It takes a decade of work to make a significant change to regulation in aviation. And I think we have years ahead of us before the large aircraft is ready to adopt novel propulsion technology from a regulatory standpoint. The technology might be there, but I think the regulations are going to lag in that case. So entering market with Part 23, or airplanes that are up to 19 passengers, I think is the fastest way, and frankly the only way we will see commercial adoption this decade. And that maybe in the next decade we'll see, through the proof points of these Part 23 smaller airplanes, we will see that technology leapfrog up into and enable the conversion of those certifications requirements in the larger Part 25 airplanes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Speaking of regional air mobility, wanted to get your thoughts on whether you think that electric aviation is what catalyzes regional air travel, or is there a, simply a thickness of the demand that's an issue that needs to be addressed somehow first. You know, we can take a brief look at history prior to the 1978 deregulation, point to point was the, airline network model, and regional travel was subsidized by the government mostly. Post deregulation, we saw the emergence of hub and spoke and a lot of regional routes were abandoned because they did not make economic sense anymore. So you can look at that to draw the conclusion that, well, actually the demand is there is just a matter of making that air travel economic. And so, that's an argument for the technology's role in disrupting, again, this, segment of the industry. If that's the case, well, first of all, do you think that's the case? And then second of all, do you think that electric aviation is the technology that will make economics appealing or you need to start layering additional things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I absolutely think, electrification is the pathway to making the economics make sense. And the improved economics drives this elasticity, this growth in the market. where we will see increased frequencies on the existing routes, decreased ticket costs as competition goes up on those, and increased accessibility or flights to fringe airports, either in a hub and spoke extension or a point to point model that, that allows more people to have access to air travel. I think adoption will also be driven by in similar economic driver but through cargo. I think the cargo market will be a rapid adopter of good economics and will be serving maybe even before the passengers choose to fly to these areas. Same day and next day delivery of packages is a growing expectation for our global economy and I think that what we'll see is as the economics improve the cargo operators, so, think your, your FedEx's, UPS's, DHL's, and similar around the world are going to be adopting these both to serve the high end communities who, want their Amazon packages in the next day, but also to open up these billion people markets that don't currently have access to the global economy efficiently, whether that's moving agricultural goods or other products, the economic drivers of increasing accessibility for them. So it's not just about U. S. states and cities. I do actually think on the global scale, these economics open up countries, entire regions of the world that are currently isolated from the global aviation ecosystem and economy. And when you look at that as a driver for scale, it's not about you know, 10 percent increase in the people who want to fly to Fresno. It's about a going from a market of zero to a market of again, hundreds of millions of people being served for the first time ever and what that drives. And so I wholeheartedly think that the economics of electrification is what gets us there. It is also on those principles that I think some of the exciting features aren't necessary to get us there. So vertical takeoff and landing, important in some areas, but probably not important for the vast majority. Fully electric and important and beneficial, but not useful if you can't land on that dirt strip in Kenya. Like, you have to have full flexibility, and this is part of the reason why I have such conviction around the regional air mobility being opened up through hybridization, where we don't have any of those infrastructure, range or operational limitations, but give that great economic benefit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Kevin, let's say we had a Part 23 aircraft and we wanted to be able to get more aircraft to cities that are not being well served today. And you're saying Part 23 was the way we'd have to do it today. What's the cost per available seat mile for a conventional aircraft, hybrid and electric? Assuming the three of them, could meet that capability today, what's the relative cost difference between the three?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the difference in CASM between conventional and hybrid, we're looking at really depends on, on exactly how you're operating the plane, right? So it's going to be a range. We're looking at a 20 to 40% savings on your cost per available seat mile. So think, again, depends on how you're flying the plane, going from a dollar per available seat mile down to, 70 cents or there's 60 some odd cents per available seat mile. that kind of a transition in certain cases. Electric's harder because right now when I run the numbers, depends on how you assume battery costs, because batteries are the big replacement cost there, but the, right now it does not in my mind, close economically to go fully electric. Also, it's hard to do the analysis because most of the routes you can't even operate. And then the question comes in on, do I count the grid infrastructure upgrade costs and capex and costs of that capital over time in the analysis, or do I not? So it gets a bit muddy. I don't have numbers specifically on the electric in isolation, for those reasons.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you talked to airlines, who today say those routes are not profitable because of the traditional aircraft? Have you talked to them about your operating costs? Are they saying, if you can get me a 30 to 35 percent reduction, that's a route that becomes profitable?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Yeah, the numbers I just talked about are from a very specific model with a very specific airline that I can't mention the names of, but yes, we get into the weeds with our customers and look at their actual operations, their actual frequencies, and how they actually fly the planes. And look at holistic costs, because it's not just about how many miles or hours you fly, it's about pilot costs, it's about outstation staffing, it's about infrastructure upgrades, and if you're serious about this, you need to look holistically at every, down to what is the interest rate on the loan that you take out in order to, or the financing that you get in order to buy the system in the first place. Like there are, all the holistic view on the economics, and making sure that is, economically positive for our customers is how we get through it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I really want to underline the holistic approach because I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. There's a lot of enthusiasm about quoting direct operating cost reductions with electrification, but if you look at it in the context of regional air mobility, where you're really competing with cars and rail and when you are accepting the fact that electric motors are not in their prime time to address this need today, and you start talking about, okay, well, what really do customers care about other than price? They care about frequency and the reliability of the schedule. And that means that you have to be able to, honor a, a service that will be available in all kinds of weather or most weather. So now you start talking about IFR capability and now you start introducing IFR reserves on top of an already small range budget. And it's only when you look at things holistically like that, do you really get a clear perspective on, okay, how really competitive is electric aviation in this particular use case today or over the next couple of years. And I think that, you know, there needs to be a little bit more realism.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I agree, because I think that realism is going to be what builds credibility. It's what enables adoption, it's what enables all of these other factors, many of which we haven't even touched on, whether it's the insurance companies or the lessors, we have to worry about residual values. the holistic view is the only way you actually get a full ecosystem to buy in. And, I just recently had a deep dive with one of our major customers, on IFR, speed, and Flight into Known Icing conditions, because these are the realities of their operation. And we need to know, hey, if we choose to fly five knots faster or five knots slower, what are the repercussions? If we are, like, flying, like, guaranteeing IFR, or if we are, if, what happens if you're not flight into known icing conditions? You're hardly useful, because it's not just Alaska where you have to deal with icing, right? It's everywhere that you have to be confident in your aircraft's ability to operate. Otherwise these mission critical operations have to ground the plane. And if you ground a plane in one of these operations, it destroys a whole network. It has a residual ripple effect through the operations, until recovered. So, so it's important to have these capabilities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So here's a thought, Kevin. What if after all is said and done, the, 30, 40, 50 percent improvement really becomes something more like 10 percent? I'm talking hypothetically here, right? At what point does it make more sense to incrementally improve the efficiency of a turboprop or a conventional aircraft that is certified, well known, all of those things, and perhaps kickstart the electrification supply chain on the unmanned side of things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It makes a lot of sense to, to find wherever you can build the efficiencies into the operation. from the airframe design, there's some folks out there who, with traditional engines, are looking at cutting 30 to 50 percent of the fuel burn out of your 7 37 class planes by bringing, blended wing body type airplanes to market. So there, there are ways that you can, by creating a new aircraft, even if you're not changing propulsion, you can get some meaningful efficiency gains as well. At the end of the day, when you achieve fewer economic benefits, it reduces the addressable market for the technology. So, or inverting that, for every percent cost that I save, it opens up more and more market opportunities. So, there's a old story in the industry about a major airline that removed a few pages from their in flight brochure to save a few pounds because that mattered, right? And these are fractions of a percent saving. So in your example of saving 10%, still transformative. For many operations. Now, is it going to be as transformative as saving 40? Nowhere close. Will it still be meaningful? Only if it's economically compelling. And so this is where you look at the conversion. You know, so maybe somebody struggles to retrofit their plane, but if you're buying a brand new plane and you get to choose between, CapEx neutral across the two, the combustion or a hybrid, and that hybrid saves 10 percent on your OpEx, you might still go with the hybrid system because economically that still makes sense. So this could be a factor that delays adoption if the economics don't work out. From an unmanned standpoint, we're already seeing from a drones, eVTOL, or like a Department of Defense type applications some fully electric, uh, or places where the economics don't matter as much, where you know, they're willing to pay a premium for the mission capability. Those are certainly additional early adopter areas where I think, the industry is likely to get a boost, regardless of the fuel savings, a boost in market applicability because of the performance characteristics of these new vehicle types.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is the drone propulsion supply chain overlapping into the propulsion supply chain that you deal with?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, a year and a half ago, we acquired a company's assets, called, the company was named Talyn and Talyn was developing a, effectively a cargo lift drone, and various types of payloads that it could carry. Our propulsion systems fit straight into that cargo drone, straight into traditional, conventional takeoff and landing drones, or eVTOL, for a whole variety of applications. Ampaire's focus is, again, the disagreement place number one. Propulsion is where you begin, and I want to put propulsion across everything. And, yeah, so the same engine types, I mean, there are flavors and variations of engines, but, the major families are applicable across. across the industry, whether it's manned or unmanned.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, tell us a little bit about Ampaire. How do you make money today? How do you make money in five years and 10 years? What's your special sweet spot?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Ampaire is focused on the electrification of aviation, focused on propulsion, specifically hybrid electric propulsion, upgrading existing aircraft types as an entry point into market and using that as a gateway to transition the industry toward lower carbon and better economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Give examples of the type of aircraft that you're converting. I saw a Skymaster as\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>so back in 2019, we flew our very first aircraft type, which is a upgraded Cessna Skymaster push pull configuration. We call that an independent parallel hybrid architecture, where you have one combustion engine, one fully electric. We've also flown the Cessna Grand Caravan, which is with an integrated parallel hybrid architecture that uses a, mechanically coupled electric and combustion set of engines to be a hybrid electric aircraft. That same engine that goes into the Caravan is what we just finished our CDR on the King Air for integrating there. We've got the Twin Otter is a 19 passenger plane in the same category. And there are thousands of planes in market that use this category of engine. So this is our half megawatt class system. We also have a quarter megawatt class system, which is used as a, either a genset or propulsion system for general aviation, drones, and eVTOLs. Now, as a company where we're focused is around the certification of that launch product and the Caravan. The market that adopts that is both passenger carrying and cargo carrying for the commercial industry, but then also we've got a number of contracts with the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Energy. So our money today, our revenue, which is really just offsetting NRE costs, or non recurring engineering costs. We've brought in about 25 million of government contracts. For these, through these government customers, for the development of our propulsion system and the application of that system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're making$500 million in 5 years, who are your primary customers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we scale commercial revenue, this comes from the regional aviation market. These are folks who are currently buying turboprop engines and would instead of overhauling their engine or buying a new engine, would be buying one of Ampaire's hybrid electric amp drives. These amp drives are the ones which save 50 percent fuel burn, and we believe will save on maintenance cost as well. So it'll be good economics for people to switch over to our systems rather than run on their traditional combustion system, and this is where we see the earliest adoption for technology. So begins as retrofits of the existing fleet of turboprops, but then quickly moves into partnering with OEMs, the aircraft manufacturers, for when they build a new airplane, giving it a hybrid option. The next phase is, of course, working on clean sheet design planes with OEMs who are optimizing planes, new designs, around the novel propulsion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Tell us a little bit about your, you have a great history of being an innovator and entrepreneur. Give us some lessons learned to our innovators who are listening today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, it's been eight and a half years at Ampaire. The number one and biggest recommendation I can give is choose something that you deeply love and that you think you can actually achieve. The days get challenging over the course of years as an entrepreneur. It is not easy. It is oftentimes not even fun. But when you know that you're doing the right thing, when you're tackling the most meaningful, challenging, visible problems that you possibly can, it gives the motivation, not just for you as an individual innovator, but truly, these are things done by teams. And when you have meaningful work, and you're thoughtful about it, it enables you to pull together teams of really great people to go do these audacious things. I think the importance of setting tangible and tractable goals that you can actually achieve in the near term is very important. It's not just about moonshots, it's about the steps on how to get there. And, and ultimately, it's about building long standing relationships and not looking for what do I get now or, being short sighted in them, because truly the world is built by people and, and supported by relationships that are built over years or decades. And so, being a good actor in the industry is so important.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, you've acquired companies, you were almost acquired yourself. What advice would you have for people who might be going through a similar process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so always be open to opportunity and thoughtfully assess it. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the opportunity to go public via SPAC was pretty exciting, and there was a whole lot of money on the table, both from company valuations and from operating budgets. But you also have to be willing to change course when it's clear that the course you're on is not the right one, which we did in early 2022. Ampaire pulled out of a deal to go public because we realized that it was, the higher risk path and it was not worth, continuing down that path of going public and getting acquired. These are hard decisions that you need clarity, you need good advisors and mentors to support you on, and ultimately you need to set the ego aside a lot of times and go on good first principles when making your decisions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, thanks a lot. What a great conversation. Thanks for your time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Thank you so much.\u003C/p>",

Everything else is fundamentally limited, either from the technology, infrastructure, market applicability, or safety and regulation sides. And hybrid threads the needle perfectly right now. And everything else you have to place a bet on an unknown that's completely out of your control. Whether it's battery energy density or hydrogen costs or infrastructure. And hybrid doesn't place any uncontrollable bets.

For those of you who've been listening to many of our last several podcasts discussions, especially those with Rob Britton and Jeff Luckett, you'll find our discussion with Kevin a perfect follow on. After discussing areas where some may disagree with Kevin, we launch into an overview of electric aviation. And the industry that blossomed due to its introduction. Kevin also discusses that the electric-only industry hasn't seen the battery progress that many had hoped, which has pushed back the timelines of many fully dedicated electric vehicles. We also discuss how electric only vehicles especially eVTOL have more limited near term use cases. We then talk about hybrid propulsion versus electric propulsion. We discuss what parts of hybrid propulsion are changing the fastest today, and it's different and unique use cases. We then discuss why an operator in regional air mobility would select an electric vehicle versus what some would consider the more obvious choice of hybrid electric propulsion. We delve a bit deeper into regional air mobility and how overall electrification may increase the use of regional air mobility. We discuss the pluses and minuses of pure electrification hybrid and traditional aircraft on regional air mobility as well. Kevin wraps up our discussion with some great advice for our innovators and entrepreneurs. Kevin, thanks for joining us for a terrific discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Kevin Noertker, as you profitably innovate in The Vertical Space. Kevin Noertker is co-founder and CEO of Ampaire. Over the past eight years, Kevin and his team have pioneered practical, compelling electrified flight through the upgrade of existing aircraft types. In 2019, they flew the world's largest hybrid electric aircraft. In 2020 and 2021 they deployed and demonstrated electrified flight with multiple airlines across the globe. With over 23,000 miles flown hybrid and 12 plus regulatory flight approvals across three countries to date, they're a leader in hybrid electric aviation. Prior to Ampaire, Kevin contributed engineering and program management expertise to advanced aircraft and satellite technology development programs at Northrop Grumman and as a research fellow at Caltech and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. An entrepreneur at heart, Kevin is driven to apply the science and engineering disciplines of large aerospace organizations to pressing environmental problems here on Earth.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, Kevin, welcome. Great to have you on the show.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's wonderful to be here.

The first is, we're in sustainable aviation and there's a lot of talk about new design planes and new markets, eVTOL and, high speed new design jets. And first is, I believe that we need to start with propulsion rather than airframe design. And there's a whole lot of good that you can do with new airframe designs, but novel propulsion is how we've seen these transformative moments progress in the past, whether that's the dawn of powered flight or the jet age. And I think you need to get the propulsion right before you start doing the transformative vehicle designs. There'll be a lot of people out there that might disagree with me on that one. Number two is that,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, I'll just, if I could jump in. I had a very senior transportation leader call me last week and say exactly\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>that's great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After listening to so many of our podcasts, he called me up and said, I want to talk about propulsion. And then I, as we were preparing for this, I was thinking, Oh, wow, this is perfect timing. So at least there's one person out there who agrees\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I appreciate that. Well, he and I should grab coffee sometime. I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp>great.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And to add this strikes me as perhaps more commonly held view than perhaps you are alluding to. All the new technology waves in aviation revolve around or are enabled by new propulsion. So what is it about this particular statement that, the industry disagrees with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's the idea that you need to do the new airframe design with the new propulsion in the first embodiment. Ampaire over the years has gotten a lot of pushback from industry stakeholders about doing upgrades of existing aircraft types. But you can't capture the full opportunity, they say, by upgrading an existing plane, you really need distributed electric propulsion, or you need the new airflow augmentation, or your vertical lift features, and that they believe that those features are going to drive the adoption dynamic, and that propulsion retrofits which is the path Ampaire has taken, is not a sufficient starting place. I think that's where the differentiation comes in. Because certainly eVTOL, let's take as an example, requires novel propulsion. what I'm saying is we can decouple those as a first step. Not to belittle the benefits that you would get from a clean sheet design, or maybe it's ultra short takeoff and landing performance. But the fact that designing a plane around propulsion that is not yet certified, that does not yet exist, is a recipe for having to redesign that plane half a dozen times. And we've already seen people burn a lot of capital going through that path this turn of the wheel. But if you just look in history, I mean, this is new design planes that didn't do it around existing propulsion. That's one of the big gotchas in the, in the design space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And there was another thing that you wanted to flag.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This is going one layer down there for propulsion. Hybrid electric is the only approach that makes sense right now. There are many exciting technologies. Obviously, fully electric is a dream many of us have. There's some corner cases where fully electric might work. There are a lot of people pushing hydrogen, but the reality is just like on the ground. Hybrid electric is going to lead, it is the gateway technology to this future. And I think it's going to be the gateway technology for decades.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I didn't expect a different answer from you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'm talking about, anything with commercial relevance, where operating flexibility, that is range, payload, airports that you can fly to and from, anywhere in the economics, anywhere that matters, and you need to get to scale, hybrid electric is what'll get you there. Everything else is fundamentally limited, either from the technology, infrastructure, market applicability, or, safety and regulation sides. And, hybrid threads the needle perfectly right now. And everything else you have to place a bet on an unknown that's completely out of your control. Whether it's battery energy density or hydrogen costs or infrastructure. And, and hybrid doesn't place any uncontrollable bets. It's just about good execution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, elaborate on this point a little bit. Why is it that the industry doesn't think that hybrid is the way to go?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think back to when we founded Ampaire. And I think back to a lot of the people in this industry who have such deep passion for making a positive impact on the world around us. And those core motivations for many are about usually one of two things. Either they care deeply about the environment and they want a true zero emissions solution. And that forces their designs into a fully electric or, a strong hybrid where you're flying fully electric for some period of time, or a hydrogen where they can claim a, zero carbon emissions in flight, if it's a fuel cell. And so what you see is this desire to have a pure carbon, remedy. And that causes people to not prefer the hybrid electric type approaches or these hybrid approaches where, you know, 50 percent fuel savings, 50 to 70 percent in our vehicles is phenomenal, but it's not zero. And if you're here on only principle and unwilling to look at anything but the pure solution, then that would bias you against it. The second is, there are some people who are pushing toward this idea of you have to start with the absolute simplest, simplest possible architecture, even if it's not possible today. And electric is phenomenally simple. And the maintenance costs are super low, and in theory you can get the economics to play out, depending on your battery assumptions. And if you believe, if you have certain optimisms in that area, then you don't want to give yourself the complexity or the crutch of having to do the partial via hybrid solution. And I think that keeps some people away from it because they say, oh, batteries will get there. Like, let's just wait around for those. But I think they miss the point that if you can serve, 10 times the market size by using hybrid electric, and you're saving half the fuel burn on that. That's, do the math, it's five times the positive impact of a few or zero emissions on that one tenth of a market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Let's talk about electric aviation. Zoom out a little bit, catch us up on some of the major milestones in electric aviation over the last several years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, electric aviation has had some pretty amazing progress in the last decade or so. The earliest companies in this industry were founded in the, 2010s but very few were talking about them at that point in time. You had the starting of, the NASA X 57 program. By the time Ampaire was founded in 2016, there still really weren't that many companies that were publicly acknowledged doing work in this space. Since then, we've seen this, this, blossoming of ideas, of concepts, I remember, the first time, I think, Peter, you were, you might have even been there at the, Uber Elevate Conference out in Dallas in 2017. There's this industry that built up around the enthusiasm for electrification. And then you saw hundreds, I believe the number peaked at over 700 different projects in this space. A lot of ideas, a lot of people who really get excited about designing airplanes. And, want to go through the features. So, big milestones. You've had first flights, whether those are the flights of the Pipistrel Alpha Electro, or ultimately that being delivered to customers around the world. You have the first flights of various development program aircraft, Ampaire's first flight in 2019, and, subsequent iterations, for example, our, Caravan flight in, 2022. The industry's also made progress from, simple demonstration of flight capability to very specific capabilities. So in eVTOL, the progress of transitioning from vertical lift to fixed wing flight has been a, a big challenge where still only a handful of companies have safely made that transition or done so with a pilot on board. These are critical milestones that will drive confidence in adoption and ability to gain regulatory approvals on the, on the operations. You've seen some incremental progress along the battery energy density. standpoint, so a lot of folks are waiting for batteries to have significantly higher watt hours per kilogram, so the gravimetric energy density in the lithium ion batteries in particular. And we've seen some modest progress on that and some really amazing announcements. Some groups who are in the chemistry side trying to, get up toward, past 500 watt hours per kilogram, targeting 1, 000 watt hours per kilogram, pretty audacious goals. I think, the industry hasn't yet seen, as significant of progress as many had hoped, and that's, that's pushing back timelines for entry into service of the fully electric, fully electric vehicles. And then from a certification standpoint, some pretty big milestones. Back to 2018, where we were kicking off a ASTM committee around electric vehicle chargers, through all the SAE committees or other industry groups working together on certification. While these might not be the visible milestones that hit the press, there's certainly the milestones and progress that help move the industry forward. And so, watching folks get their first certification bases established, or get a, get means of compliance agreed upon, or special conditions, moving forward, ultimately looking, I think here in the next few years, we'll get the first full, regulatory approvals for commercial operation. And, and each of those are some of the very meaningful milestones that are, happening real time and coming up soon.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the surprises for me was, the lack of certification events following Pipistrel's EASA certification of their, Velis Electro aircraft in the LSA category that was back in the summer of 2020. And then earlier this year, I think in March, the FAA issued an LSA airworthiness exemption for that same aircraft. But here we are four years later and no other electric aircraft has been certified. Why do you think that's the case? What's the bottleneck? about the.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think the, there are a few things. One is, the regulatory basis for certification. And the Pipistrel products didn't fully open up the Part 23 or the vertical lift, certification arena. it was in a different category initially. And I think that while it made progress and maybe others could have taken their products through that same, the, you know, the identical regulatory pathway, many of the products that are out there that we most were paying attention to are in Part 23 or the vertical lift category, which was not as fully opened up through the Pipistrel application. Think second was a bit of the dynamics in the market, so with the pandemic in 2020, I think a lot of milestones were dragged out a bit. 2021, money was easy, and I think that meant that money went to moonshots. So easy money doesn't mean it goes to practical, near term, near term wins. And so I think that a lot of the money that was being invested in late 2020 and throughout 2021 was going toward long horizon plays. So purposefully not aiming at super near term strategies. And I think that overfunded those, and we've seen many get significant funding, but then burning through it, and I think it underfunded the pragmatic strategies. and so what you saw was further pressures on or delays to the timelines for entry into service for those that might not have been as flashy, but were, were just making the, the next increment of meaningful progress. And then we've seen the retrenchment of the markets where now there's a bit of a recoil. I think, the industry's at risk of losing credibility. Given all the claims that were made and failed to be lived up to, whether that's certain timelines, or product performance, or cost metrics for the products. And so, I think the industry, in particular the capital allocators, may be licking their wounds from those moonshot projects that didn't play out, which doesn't help again those that are near term. What it does is it pulls back more capital away from everything, and so if you're looking at that as a lowering tide, each of these dynamics I think is has pressed away from certification milestones that we might have otherwise hoped to see more rapidly after the Pipistrel's early successes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what about the maturity of the enabling technologies themselves and the certifiability of the motors and batteries. What's the status there? And I was recently catching up with another founder and we started talking about this and it was surprising to hear how the regulatory bodies are trying to apply traditional propulsion system requirements to electric motors. So for instance, I think there's a requirement somewhere in internal combustion engines that they need to be able to run for, I think it's five minutes in max rated power, whereas an electric motor reaches its thermal limit, a lot quicker, maybe within, two minutes or so before needing to throttle back. And so that is one contentious issue, allegedly as is the example of having dual magnetos in ICE engines, and does that translate into, you know, double architecture in electric motors, all of that increasing mass, increasing budget, and really not making that cost equation as favorable as initially expected. Do you have any insights into those aspects of how the bottlenecks are being tackled at the certifiability and the maturity of the technologies?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think that this gets to one of the really critical and core risks in the industry, which is the supply chain and the ability to not just invent something, but to produce it reliably many times at a good economics. That's really what builds the markets here. I think the regulatory bodies are trying to adapt to what they know. And, those adaptations, whether it's the Part 23 rewrite, which adapted combustion type expectations to, an opener, larger net for what kind of technologies could actually be used to meet those requirements. But in the details, they're still looking for that familiarity. So what's your mean time between failure? How long can you run at full power? What are the failure modes and effects, and making sure that you're going through the detail on that? This is the, the specifics that you get into when putting together your program certification plan, your means of compliance, or ultimately going through the testing for your, Type Certificate or STC, and it is, it's really where the rubber hits the road in the industry. I don't think that all the answers are there yet. I think there are the early entrance, certainly Ampaire is, at least to our knowledge, the only company working on a hybrid electric propulsion system certification program actively with the FAA. And so this means that we are, we're clearing many of those open questions actively with them and collaboratively with them. It also means that we have, expectations upon our supply chain that, emerge over time if something, for example, with the FAA, brings up or highlights a requirement that we did not expect. As you talked about with the motors. for these questions about redundancy, there's what you could expect as a technologist, like you'd understand the technology and you believe this to be true, some level of safety, let's say, but that does not mean that will be accepted on the first pass through certification. And in fact, I think that the first paths through certification are going to be relatively risk averse and risk managed in those setting a higher bar for redundancy, not giving you credit for levels of safety that you think you might deserve. So, case in point, for the lithium ion batteries, no matter what you do to the cells, no matter how you package those cells into your modules, no matter what physical, interconnect or disconnect controls you have that might mitigate thermal runaway, or physical barriers that might mitigate propagation or software layers that are on top of all of that. The belts and suspenders and layers of safety. At the end of the day, the FAA, probably rightly so at this stage, requires you to show that you have physical barriers that if you force the battery into thermal runaway, the vehicle will be safe. So you don't get, you don't get actual credit for everything below that. You need ultimate safety and then all the other stuff that you thought was going to be sufficient. And these are, again, I don't think it should be surprising to anybody that the earliest, earliest applications, we're going to take a, the most risk managed approach. But what it means is that when you're a battery engineer on your fully electric vehicle, you're now doubling the weight of all these additional systems when you thought you could get there just with a really good BMS algorithm. And so what it drives is the decisions and it drives the, ultimately the designs into corners that might not be viable given some of those early assumptions. This is why we pushed again toward hybrid electric, because with a battery pack, a third the size of a Tesla pack and able to take on the extra weight and the payload hit along with it for all these physical layers of safety, we still have phenomenal performance on our system. and I think that these are, these are areas where the industry is trying to navigate alongside the regulations to mature, the solutions and the risk, together.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, what electric aircraft are selling in meaningful numbers today that you're impressed by?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you say stelling, I'm gonna assume you mean where there's a cash transaction and somebody ends up with an airplane. in their hangar at the end of it, and right now the only airplanes that are selling, are the Pipistrel aircraft at this time. There are many organizations placing orders, pre orders for, eventual deliveries, but at this stage, very minimal on the actual sales in this market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Kevin, what are you seeing as the FAA's thought process for how industry is going to incorporate improvements in hybrid electric propulsion systems into these aircraft in the coming years. These aircraft are long lived assets. Batteries still seem to be improving pretty markedly over the years. Motor technology as well. So if you certify something, on the one hand, you're locked in at that point in time, are they going to use an STC method for bringing improvements in? Or is there something that is even more fluid for allowing that, that they have in mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's a really good point because the technology base is moving so much faster than the time scale of a vehicle life, right? These aircraft last 40 years. And the, batteries are improving on the, on the order of every two to three years, you'd expect people wanting an upgrade of their battery pack to the next generation, a little bit like people might want their new iPhone every few years. The way you go about certifying your product matters. And if you wrap everything into the type certificate, then you need to amend or update the type certificate when anything changes. And so that would require a supplemental type certificate for certain types of changes. Generally, propulsion systems, propellers, or airframe changes require a new type certificate, or a amendment, or a STC, supplemental type certificate. There are things you can change on an airplane without having to go get an STC. You could replace a conforming part with an equivalent part. You're able to show certain equivalent levels of safety. And so there are efforts to try to find ways that these components which would be replaced over time, let's use the batteries as an example. Batteries degrade over the cycles of use, and every few years you want to replace those. You have to go get an STC for the new battery pack are you able to use a TSO type of process? Basically a lighter version of those approvals. And it really depends on exactly how that battery pack was incorporated into the vehicle level certification. So is it part of the engine? Is it part of the aircraft? Is it a safety of flight critical component? And then as technology improves, One of the things in aviation is you lock yourself into the parts that you designed and that an in any change in that part requires a change in your regulatory approval. So as batteries improve, how do you go through that certification pathway? Again, generally, what I think the industry will see is we guarantee equivalent performance while providing improved performance. And that all you're doing when you're meeting the existing regulatory waterline is you're saying we're at least as good as we were previously, and we haven't changed any flight characteristics. The question will be, when do you want to take credit for that? When do you want to allow the operator to plan a longer route? You can give them more energy, which gives them more safety, or maybe it gives them more flexibility on how many, how many flight miles they can perform or when they need to recharge at the other end. But it might not be part of the underlying. certification, performance capability of the vehicle that you've, that you've sought from the regulatory body. Now, this is a nuance, but it's the difference between having to go through the full cert program for the new tech or just increasing performance but taking credit for an equivalent level of safety. One specific point here, in our hybrid system, I have triplicate redundancy in our hybrids. We are phenomenally safe, and I believe safer than a traditional combustion engine would be, where it's a single point failure for the traditional engine. And in our, in Ampaire's system, we have redundancy, two layers of redundancy in the combustion engine. And then also this independent electric system, which is able to carry you further as well. But am I going to get credit for anything more than a single engine capability? Probably not. and that's understandable, at least initially. And I think over time, what people, what you'll get is additional credit for those things from the regulatory body. And in the interim, when new tech, motors, or batteries come out, It'll be at equivalent levels of safety as what was there previously.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What components of the hybrid electric propulsion system are changing the fastest right now, be it the battery systems, the motors themselves, power electronics, or something else? What do you see as the fastest changing or evolving?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, the fastest changing components historically have been those which had the benefit of riding the coattails of other industries. Aviation, as big as we love it and believe it is, is much smaller than, as a market driver, than other forms of ground transportation. And so we have been the recipients of rapid technology improvement across lithium ion batteries as energy density, volume density and cost get brought down. The, the motors have been a, truly the underlying enabling factor in many of these cases. So the power density of motors is pretty phenomenal compared to where it was a decade ago. And we still see companies that are, and we work closely with companies that are pioneering in this space. And you can start, you're getting great efficiencies and really high, power density out of these motors. Where, certainly Ampaire has locked most of the components for our launch product, but we have a flying testbed where we're able to bring in new technologies, where we first flew a silicon carbide inverter, when we have brought in new motors, inverters, and energy storage tech. And it's really in those, the motors and batteries that most people are pushing firmly for innovation, and then a bit in the efficiency of the power electronics, but a lot of that currently is, seems like it's lab scale technology. And while our work with ARPA E and NASA enables us to make that move even faster, I hesitate to, to think that lab technology today is going to rapidly enter commercialization anytime soon. I think we've seen a consistent trend that timelines for those developments take much longer than, than the, the technology teams would, would have originally anticipated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is aviation going to continue to benefit from advances in the automotive industry around the batteries that they use? Or is there going to be a fork in the road where the needs of aviation diverge from what the auto industry is pushing towards?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think, the auto industry used to have range anxiety. But then battery energy density got to the point that you can drive hundreds of miles. There's a sufficient charging network. So I don't see the energy density being what automotive is optimizing for anymore. Really, I think automotive is going to continue optimizing for cost, and we've seen that over the last few years. Bringing the cost of an EV down is the driver for adoption more than bringing the range up. Whereas in aviation, we're still in that bringing the range up is the requirement. And so this is a divergence in the optimization goals for the technology coming out of automotive. Now the question would be, even if the goals are different, is the state of the art, the state of knowledge and capability, is that going to improve? As folks go toward lower cost, are we going to also see emergent benefits for aviation? Absolutely. As people do innovation and build new types of electric machines, it's no longer just about what is Tesla using in a Roadster, it's about where the larger vehicles, your mid duty and heavy duty trucks, what are the power requirements for those vehicles. What are the energy densities required for those? And so it's this expanding fringe of requirements that I think will also drive a, an alignment in, in, in emerging technologies with what aviation is looking for. But the core of a ground car is, is less likely to directly align with aviation than it did over the last decade in my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Are the batteries that you would design around for your hybrid electric conventional takeoff and landing airplane, are they the same ones that you would design around for a VTOL aircraft? And the reason I ask is that, an additional difference that I've, come to appreciate with batteries for VTOL aircraft is the power output demand on them, especially requiring high power output at the end of the flight as the aircraft transitions back into vertical flight to make its approach at the landing pad. That's a particularly, stringent requirement on the battery system. For what you're doing, I don't know, maybe that still exists. Maybe it's the same battery. Maybe you, you can, use the same tech, but how do you think about that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, it's a nuance that most of the world, unlike you, Peter, most of the world doesn't catch the nuance between the different types of batteries. The power density versus the energy density needs to be tailored for the application. And what's interesting is you gave two examples. I'll add one more in there around fully electric airplanes. So let's take your eVTOL, which is fully electric, but requires huge amounts of power at a low state of charge at the end of flight, right? So you need a power cell there. Then you have a fully electric airplane, which has a large amount of batteries. And so actually a relatively low C rate, especially if it's conventional takeoff and landing. You're not really draining where, for those listening, the C rate is the rate of charge or discharge. as a proportion of the total pack size. And so that, when you have a really large pack, relative to your pack size, you're not discharging that rapidly. And so those can be energy cells, because you don't really need that high power C rate. But then you go to a hybrid electric plane. And as I mentioned, our pack is about a third the size of a Tesla pack. These are pretty small, actually. When you come through our hangar, you see this battery is big enough to fly a Caravan, really. And that is because in a hybrid, you use the battery differently than you would in the fully electric. A small battery pack, but you still have pretty high power for takeoff and climb. Again, now you need a higher C rate. You need more of a power cell. And so for each application, you do actually have different requirements for the type of the type of chemistry you might consider, the, tailoring of that cell between energy and power, certainly the life cycle economics of the pack, the degradation over time, you might have great power or great energy, but if you only cycle 400 times, then are you useful? There's a, there's, there are all these pieces that go into the details of selecting a battery. And this is the challenge that some companies who are trying to do a one size fits all, cell or module for everybody, need to hit the high waterline or miss the, miss the mark on their, their certain markets. And this is again, why I think it's so important to have a more flexible design where let's say that I need to increase the size of my pack a little bit because I'm not getting exactly what I wanted out of my supply chain, where we can handle that. it's not ideal. We don't desire it, but when you have a, an approach, which is just a little bit more flexible than, the pure heart requirement, I think most eVTOL folks. A lot of the ones who have decided to in house their battery development is because they realize they will not get precisely what they need from anyone else, and they have to tailor it directly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Given the advantages of the hybrid propulsion to electric, why would the eVTOL or the electric plane companies go purely electric versus hybrid? What would be some of their rationale?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Number one is, that I hear from them is on the emissions. They want to be able to say they can operate fully zero emissions. Number two is a statement around, around complexity, the economics of maintenance and that's a, it's an interesting argument which, without being deep into the weeds, it's hard to validate or, dispute. All the weeds that I've been in have shown that fully electric still has a way to go before it's economically more viable. But those are usually why I see, that it can, there are other ancillary features, like, for example, noise characteristics are important for communities. Oftentimes the reason communities get upset with aviation is because of the noise. And hybrid electric does not fully eliminate the noise profile, to the extent that full, that fully electric does. Fully electric planes, if you've ever flown in one, it's like being in a glider a lot of the time. It's really beautiful. and I think that some people have hung their hats on the sound, and frankly, to their credit, if you're an eVTOL talking about flying to the city center of Manhattan, you better be thinking about sound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's not how people are going to scale in the next several years. At the end of the day, regional air mobility most likely is how a vehicle is going to scale in the next, let's face it, 5 to 10 years. And given regional air mobility, given the requirements of the vehicles, I'm guessing that hybrid is going to be the, the limitations of hybrid are not nearly as impactful as they would be if they go into city center. And how many city center flights are going to be occurring in the next five to ten years, and especially at scale. So my guess is a lot of people right now listening are saying, hybrid's the way to go. Why would they not be saying that, especially as we start to talk about regional air mobility?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so it depends on who they are. Let's say that you are an eVTOL developer. We know many. And you've spent the last half a decade, investing how many hundreds of millions of dollars into your pure electric design. That is tailored, that every inch of it is optimized specifically for your fully electric operation. You don't have volume, you don't have weight, you would have to redesign your plane in order to integrate a hybrid electric system. And I know this because I've worked with those groups, and we have shown that you can apply a hybrid electric system in. But shoehorning a hybrid into a combustion plane is one thing, that's where we enter the market. Shoehorning a hybrid into something which was designed for a little battery pack, is a completely different beast. And I think a lot of these developers have gotten so deep into their fully electric application that they don't have the payload and volume capacity to take on the hybrid electric into their current designs. And so,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But let's move on. Let's say, Kevin, sorry, great answer, but let's talk about the operators who are going to be purchasing these vehicles. Why would they consider a fully, let's again, let's step into regional air mobility. Why would they consider a fully electric plane with its, with some of its limitations? Obviously some pluses, but the hybrid I would assume is still less noisy, for example, than a traditional combustion engine. Why would they consider a fully electric plane rather than a hybrid for regional air mobility in the next 5 to 10 years? What's their rationale? Put yourself in the position of an operator who has to make that decision.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so I would ask, what's the risk? Am I, what, truly, what's the risk? The risk that I put down an order? Even if it's binding, I'm sure there are tons of outs that if it, if this doesn't meet my performance requirements, I don't have to buy it. And probably if I'm putting money down, it's going into an escrow that it can come back to me. Most aren't putting money down for the fully electric, type orders that are out there. And so I would look at it and say, I could place an order for a fully electric plane and if it doesn't pan out, great. If all of the Swiss cheese of good things going right doesn't occur, I probably got a boost to my marketing and brand along the way, and I'm not out any money at the end of the day, I could probably still buy a hybrid down the road. Now, the reality is a lot of these groups are falling behind in our order books, so, potentially they won't be as, as, as early as they would like, but if magic happens and the performance is what people would love electric to be, then I get the electric plane and everything that I needed. And so I think it's a risk posture that, the benefit of placing a signaling order outweighs the risk. And the key for me, as Kevin and with my Ampaire hat on, is those folks still place orders for hybrids. Right? Like, when I talk to folks, they're like, Kevin, this is the first thing that I actually have confidence is going to come to market. I'm going to place an order for this. And what's silly is some of those people still say, and by the way, we don't want to talk publicly about this because our brand is still like fully zero emissions, but we know that this is probably going to come in first. And so we'd like to take part in it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, in what way is certifying a hybrid configuration easier or more difficult compared to certifying a battery electric?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the hybrid, one of the reasons it's easier is the safety case. The safety case for our system in the, condition where you assume you have an issue with the electric vehicle system, which is really what is the novel, parts of the technology. If you're in a hybrid electric condition like ours, you fall back onto a combustion engine and you fly home safely. We have full cruise capacity. With our combustion engine, so there's no degradation or risk to that operation if you shut off the electric system in flight. You can't say that for a fully electric, or hydrogen, for example, system that, when you have an issue, maybe you have redundancy in the battery packs, but the level of safety that you can, that you can, take credit for in the hybrid is quite a bit higher. And, and certifying that is, is we believe going to be faster and lower complexity and lower cost than going fully electric. The second is around the size and, requirements on each of the subcomponents. So whether it's the batteries or the motors, when you look at the reduced consequence of an issue, you can also, take different or take a different balance on the, the probability of certain issues occurring. And, and so the holistic risk analysis for the, the safety case, we have a little bit more flexibility. And that means that flexibility translates into the supply chain and our ability to move a bit more quickly and getting those, getting those technologies through the certification program.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the expected efficiency gain of a hybrid electric conventional aircraft versus the efficiency gain that we are seeing from hybrid electric automobiles? And is there a difference? And if so, why? And then we can get into efficiency gain that you would see from just like retrofitting an existing airplane versus designing an airplane around hybrid electric. Especially for the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft because going to electric propulsion when you want to do distributed electric propulsion for vertical flight or for electric STOL, okay, we get that, right? There's a capability there that's earning its way onto the aircraft. But if you are going for conventional takeoff and landing, and you are looking for an efficiency gain, what can we expect to see?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. So the efficiency of these hybrid systems, and I, I see hybrid as this gateway technology that as the underlying technology improves directionally toward fully electric, all of it will first get proven out in these hybrid electric systems, conditions. One of the, one of the great drivers for adoption of hybrid electric is the fuel efficiency of the systems that, that we and have already demonstrated and have been flying tens of thousands of miles so far in our hybrid systems and demonstrated a 50% fuel burn reduction. During takeoff and climb cycle, we're up closer to 70 percent fuel burn reduction. So these are actual measurements, right? This is not just an Excel spreadsheet model. This is empirical data and is the kind of benefit that you can get in certain embodiments of hybrid electric systems. So this is, pretty, pretty significant fuel savings, even when you're looking at the, the opportunity of hybrid-electric on the ground, where, call it maybe a 40 percent fuel savings, to 50 percent fuel savings on the ground. And it's all about the specific architecture of the system that drives the beneficial economics. Fuel is one of the largest, if not the largest, operating cost for most airlines. And so the fuel burn reduction then drives a positive cycle for the economic viability of new routes and market growth and higher frequencies of service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What phase of flight are these efficiencies realized the most?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, if you're just looking at a pure percentage basis of fuel savings, takeoff and climb is where you're getting the biggest boost from the electric system in our current architecture. There are lots of different hybrid architectures, and we've got a few of them, but what we're launching into product, into market with is a integrated parallel hybrid architecture where we use the electric system effectively as a boost during the high power phases of flight and the combustion engine as a baseline load of power for the cruise and, and across the rest of the flight. So you get up to 70 percent fuel savings, during that takeoff and climb cycle. And then it levels off toward about 50 percent fuel savings during the cruise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I see. What's the state of the art in some of the metrics on the battery side? We talked a little bit about, well, we didn't talk numbers, but gravimetric specific energy density, both at the cell and the pack level, the cycle life that state of the art batteries are achieving, and the, battery pack cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the, the batteries, so watt hours per kilogram is the metric that we in the industry normally uses to measure the energy density. The target most are aiming for is right around 400 watt hours per kilogram at a pack level. We're not close to that today. When you're looking at the packs today, you're at, right around 200 watt hours per kilogram really depends on your cooling system and where you draw the dotted line on the battery pack itself and what you include as weight versus don't include as kind of wet versus dry weight for the pack. The cells themselves, are, I remember a few years ago seeing cells that were cresting through the 200s of watt hours per kilogram, and then you get folks who are talking about 300, even into the 400 watt hour per kilogram cells. I think I've seen announcements about cells that are even significantly higher than that. Unfortunately, I'm not an expert in the kind of the lab type chemistry that goes into these batteries and the art of understanding where along the long tail of getting from lab into production you are and in measuring the number of years remaining is very challenging. And so it's hard to tell what, like, state of the art for, for the development of new technologies sounds like it's pretty far ahead in these high watt hours per kilogram. I think the reality is the first battery packs that get adopted into market are going to be at a pack level, maybe even sub 200 watt hours per kilogram, when you're looking full scope, full scope weight of the system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And in terms of cycle life and cost?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Cycle life and cost are, generally tailored depending on what your application are. So if you've got a more exotic cell, a higher power or energy density, it'll probably have a lower cycle life. I've heard some of our industry peers talking about cycle lives less than a thousand cycles. I don't see how that makes a whole lot of economic sense when you have to be replacing the batteries so, so repeatedly. We think that a 2, 000 to 3, 000 cycles, maybe it's 2, 000 full depth discharge, but you're looking at, you know, that might give you 4, 000 or 5, 000 actual flight cycles on a, on a vehicle, that's not unrealistic when you're not working with the most exotic type cells. And from a cost, I think, we're pretty conservative assuming costs are going to be pretty, pretty high, and it's hard to tell what'll come out in full production once you actually get to scale, but being at$500 per kilowatt hour, I think would be a great outcome for the industry if we were able to get there. And, I wouldn't be surprised if the very first battery packs that came to market were quite a, maybe a multiple higher than that. So maybe a thousand dollars per kilowatt hour. Which gets pretty expensive, especially when you're looking at the very large packs for, for the fully electric vehicles, but is still somewhat manageable with the, with the hybrid electric approach.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to put some business perspective into the conversation and if we use, uh, maybe we can get to ultimately the use case that you are pursuing at Ampaire, but one of the common near term use cases for electric aircraft is often thought of on the conventional side as a flight school trainer aircraft. Now, putting aside that the current range restrictions do not enable flight schools to use electric aircraft for the entirety of the curriculum for flight training, but for most, missions, it's good enough. What I'm interested in is when you actually go down into the weeds that you've been in, how the business case for an electric, fully battery powered aircraft pencils out when you consider the fact that, conventional piston engines are an industry that's been around for decades, benefiting from huge economies of scale, exceptional safety records, it's in the several thousands annual units, a lot of the development and R&amp; D costs have been recovered already. I mean, you're going after a relatively low cost. And I think the engine, replacement on, in this type application is in the 30, 40, 50. maybe 70, 000 per engine, correct me guys, uh, if I'm off. Uh, but at any rate, uh, you have that on the one hand, and then you have an electric, aircraft with a motor that, needs to recover the certification costs and development costs, and is one that every, you know, thousand cycles needs to replace the battery, which can be, I don't know, 80, 000 or whatever the cost is. So when you bake all of these different things, does it really become an attractive option?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So this gets back to your first question around what might the industry disagree with me on, and it is this principle that the economics must make sense in order for people to adopt the products. There are a lot of people out there who assume government subsidies will get us there, or people willing to pay a green premium. And while certain cases that might be true, to hit the scale of adoption that's required, you can't achieve it without really compelling economic benefits for the end user and buyer. So this example that you gave around the, the training, especially in these smaller airplanes, is a great one. The market makes so much sense. The direct operating cost seems so low when you're only taking into account the industrial power that you're using. It's cents on the dollar for OpEx. But when you look whole scale and you're comparing yourself against a, sub 100, 000 airplane with relatively low cost of capital, it's probably fully depreciated, and you're comparing that to a quarter million dollar new build plane that has these unknowns around the cost of batteries over time, or the cost of the infrastructure to charge. The economics are really called into question, especially before you get to full scale. And I think that's, rightly should be acknowledged as one of the big risks for adoption. The performance of the systems, especially in training, I think a blended fleet where, cross country flights might have to be in a hybrid or combustion, but fully electric can be done for the, a few touch and goes here or there, or just familiarization. That's, I think that's completely reasonable to solve the problem. But the economics, especially in smaller airplanes, are pretty challenging. When you look at the economics as you scale to larger planes, it similarly, anywhere that it's not an operator of, high frequency becomes challenging because to earn back the capital cost of the system, you really need high utilization. And, you're not generally going against an option which is a premium priced combustion versus a premium priced electric. It's probably a relatively low cost combustion versus a premium priced electric, and I think that will be a friction point for adoption for those types of applications.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, if you were to argue for a fully battery electric aircraft, what is the right initial use case that will generate this flywheel moment where it makes sense and it also is a good path to get to scale, which will have benefits down the road with economies of scale and the supply chain, et cetera, et cetera. What use case gets the industry going, if not flight training.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think the use case that gets the electrification industry going is using those technologies in full scale applications. So it's taking the exact same batteries, the motors, the power electronics, These certification bases, taking those and by applying them into the hybrid electric applications, you build the industry base. You build the production volumes. You solve those economic challenges tied in with the supply chain and the certification and the market's readiness to adopt. Tying in with the economics of the full scope view, you start to bring those costs down to a point where all of a sudden those same technologies, those same suppliers that are making batteries for the hybrid or making motors for the hybrid, when the economics of scale get to a point, those same suppliers will be the supply base for the fully electric applications where, the opportunities are vast for, where you might want to fly a fully electric plane, whether it's short hop island hopping for commercial cargo flights, commercial drones, or for eVTOL cargo, or for pilot training. There are a lot of areas where you might want the fully electric. And I think the way to get the industry to scale is by scaling the underlying components rather than scaling the end solution of fully electric. And that's when I talk about hybrid as this gateway technology, I truly believe I'm helping all the electric, maybe even helping some hydrogen out there. Like because we're maturing the industry, we're maturing the supply base and we're getting up to good economics, full scale marketability of these underlying technologies that ultimately can be packaged in the fully electric. And that's I think that's how you get there. In eight and a half years of every waking and sleeping moment thinking about it, this is the pathway that makes sense to me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We just had Rob Britton on a couple weeks ago, our last podcast, and he was talking about regional air mobility, and he was saying that it's conceivable that hybrid or electric aircraft will allow us to be able to get to locations that today are less profitable than using a purely combustion engine aircraft. Talk a little bit about that. I'm guessing that hybrid would be the only solution today, although he did mention, I believe, guys, a 30 passenger electric plane as a potential solution in the near future. But talk about the capabilities for hybrid electric for regional air mobility. What's the near term, long term solution from your perspective, Kevin?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I really enjoyed listening to the episode with Rob and his enthusiasm for regional hybrid electric. You can hear it coming through in the conversation. Love it. And the folks over at Heart who you mentioned a few times, you know doing some really interesting work in trying to open up the regional space. Also in that episode, he had mentioned that this regional space is kind of eroded over the years. I mean, with deregulation and things having to compete just on the economics, economics really didn't make sense to serve a lot of secondary or tertiary markets. And so the service to those markets has gone away. And, that demand still exists, it's just being served by ground transportation, people jumping in their cars instead of flying. If you were able to give an economic alternative, lower cost of operation, being the key adoption driver, then people would potentially choose to fly those routes instead of drive those routes. And I think he was spot on with that and the enthusiasm around regional air mobility. Two areas that I would disagree with the approach, though. One is there's a phenomenal difference between a 19 passenger plane and a 20 passenger plane. While it might look almost the same, it is categorically different, in the literal sense of it, is a different category of airplane between Part 23 and Part 33. And the idea that somebody will open up regional air mobility with a Part 25 plane that is something over 20 passengers, I think, is faulty logic there. I don't think it's going to be, Part 25 is not going to be ready for hybrid electric, fully electric, any novel system for quite some time. Now, I want it to be there, and we're certainly helping the industry get there, and there are companies betting their, livelihood on it, but this is where I would disagree with the approach because we believe Part 23 is where it has to start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, explain for the audience the nuances of the differences.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So there are two major categories for conventional airplanes. One category, which is under Part 23 of the regulations, governs all planes up to 19 passengers or the equivalent weight. Part 25 governs all airplanes, 20 passengers and above. And so when regulations are updated in the industry, they're updated for one category or the other, eventually both. The smaller aircraft category, Part 23, is already positioned with all of the legislation and regulation in place to adopt novel propulsion technologies. The larger category is not in that state yet. It takes a decade of work to make a significant change to regulation in aviation. And I think we have years ahead of us before the large aircraft is ready to adopt novel propulsion technology from a regulatory standpoint. The technology might be there, but I think the regulations are going to lag in that case. So entering market with Part 23, or airplanes that are up to 19 passengers, I think is the fastest way, and frankly the only way we will see commercial adoption this decade. And that maybe in the next decade we'll see, through the proof points of these Part 23 smaller airplanes, we will see that technology leapfrog up into and enable the conversion of those certifications requirements in the larger Part 25 airplanes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Speaking of regional air mobility, wanted to get your thoughts on whether you think that electric aviation is what catalyzes regional air travel, or is there a, simply a thickness of the demand that's an issue that needs to be addressed somehow first. You know, we can take a brief look at history prior to the 1978 deregulation, point to point was the, airline network model, and regional travel was subsidized by the government mostly. Post deregulation, we saw the emergence of hub and spoke and a lot of regional routes were abandoned because they did not make economic sense anymore. So you can look at that to draw the conclusion that, well, actually the demand is there is just a matter of making that air travel economic. And so, that's an argument for the technology's role in disrupting, again, this, segment of the industry. If that's the case, well, first of all, do you think that's the case? And then second of all, do you think that electric aviation is the technology that will make economics appealing or you need to start layering additional things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I absolutely think, electrification is the pathway to making the economics make sense. And the improved economics drives this elasticity, this growth in the market. where we will see increased frequencies on the existing routes, decreased ticket costs as competition goes up on those, and increased accessibility or flights to fringe airports, either in a hub and spoke extension or a point to point model that, that allows more people to have access to air travel. I think adoption will also be driven by in similar economic driver but through cargo. I think the cargo market will be a rapid adopter of good economics and will be serving maybe even before the passengers choose to fly to these areas. Same day and next day delivery of packages is a growing expectation for our global economy and I think that what we'll see is as the economics improve the cargo operators, so, think your, your FedEx's, UPS's, DHL's, and similar around the world are going to be adopting these both to serve the high end communities who, want their Amazon packages in the next day, but also to open up these billion people markets that don't currently have access to the global economy efficiently, whether that's moving agricultural goods or other products, the economic drivers of increasing accessibility for them. So it's not just about U. S. states and cities. I do actually think on the global scale, these economics open up countries, entire regions of the world that are currently isolated from the global aviation ecosystem and economy. And when you look at that as a driver for scale, it's not about you know, 10 percent increase in the people who want to fly to Fresno. It's about a going from a market of zero to a market of again, hundreds of millions of people being served for the first time ever and what that drives. And so I wholeheartedly think that the economics of electrification is what gets us there. It is also on those principles that I think some of the exciting features aren't necessary to get us there. So vertical takeoff and landing, important in some areas, but probably not important for the vast majority. Fully electric and important and beneficial, but not useful if you can't land on that dirt strip in Kenya. Like, you have to have full flexibility, and this is part of the reason why I have such conviction around the regional air mobility being opened up through hybridization, where we don't have any of those infrastructure, range or operational limitations, but give that great economic benefit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Kevin, let's say we had a Part 23 aircraft and we wanted to be able to get more aircraft to cities that are not being well served today. And you're saying Part 23 was the way we'd have to do it today. What's the cost per available seat mile for a conventional aircraft, hybrid and electric? Assuming the three of them, could meet that capability today, what's the relative cost difference between the three?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So the difference in CASM between conventional and hybrid, we're looking at really depends on, on exactly how you're operating the plane, right? So it's going to be a range. We're looking at a 20 to 40% savings on your cost per available seat mile. So think, again, depends on how you're flying the plane, going from a dollar per available seat mile down to, 70 cents or there's 60 some odd cents per available seat mile. that kind of a transition in certain cases. Electric's harder because right now when I run the numbers, depends on how you assume battery costs, because batteries are the big replacement cost there, but the, right now it does not in my mind, close economically to go fully electric. Also, it's hard to do the analysis because most of the routes you can't even operate. And then the question comes in on, do I count the grid infrastructure upgrade costs and capex and costs of that capital over time in the analysis, or do I not? So it gets a bit muddy. I don't have numbers specifically on the electric in isolation, for those reasons.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you talked to airlines, who today say those routes are not profitable because of the traditional aircraft? Have you talked to them about your operating costs? Are they saying, if you can get me a 30 to 35 percent reduction, that's a route that becomes profitable?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Yeah, the numbers I just talked about are from a very specific model with a very specific airline that I can't mention the names of, but yes, we get into the weeds with our customers and look at their actual operations, their actual frequencies, and how they actually fly the planes. And look at holistic costs, because it's not just about how many miles or hours you fly, it's about pilot costs, it's about outstation staffing, it's about infrastructure upgrades, and if you're serious about this, you need to look holistically at every, down to what is the interest rate on the loan that you take out in order to, or the financing that you get in order to buy the system in the first place. Like there are, all the holistic view on the economics, and making sure that is, economically positive for our customers is how we get through it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:08:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I really want to underline the holistic approach because I think you're hitting the nail right on the head. There's a lot of enthusiasm about quoting direct operating cost reductions with electrification, but if you look at it in the context of regional air mobility, where you're really competing with cars and rail and when you are accepting the fact that electric motors are not in their prime time to address this need today, and you start talking about, okay, well, what really do customers care about other than price? They care about frequency and the reliability of the schedule. And that means that you have to be able to, honor a, a service that will be available in all kinds of weather or most weather. So now you start talking about IFR capability and now you start introducing IFR reserves on top of an already small range budget. And it's only when you look at things holistically like that, do you really get a clear perspective on, okay, how really competitive is electric aviation in this particular use case today or over the next couple of years. And I think that, you know, there needs to be a little bit more realism.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I agree, because I think that realism is going to be what builds credibility. It's what enables adoption, it's what enables all of these other factors, many of which we haven't even touched on, whether it's the insurance companies or the lessors, we have to worry about residual values. the holistic view is the only way you actually get a full ecosystem to buy in. And, I just recently had a deep dive with one of our major customers, on IFR, speed, and Flight into Known Icing conditions, because these are the realities of their operation. And we need to know, hey, if we choose to fly five knots faster or five knots slower, what are the repercussions? If we are, like, flying, like, guaranteeing IFR, or if we are, if, what happens if you're not flight into known icing conditions? You're hardly useful, because it's not just Alaska where you have to deal with icing, right? It's everywhere that you have to be confident in your aircraft's ability to operate. Otherwise these mission critical operations have to ground the plane. And if you ground a plane in one of these operations, it destroys a whole network. It has a residual ripple effect through the operations, until recovered. So, so it's important to have these capabilities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So here's a thought, Kevin. What if after all is said and done, the, 30, 40, 50 percent improvement really becomes something more like 10 percent? I'm talking hypothetically here, right? At what point does it make more sense to incrementally improve the efficiency of a turboprop or a conventional aircraft that is certified, well known, all of those things, and perhaps kickstart the electrification supply chain on the unmanned side of things?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It makes a lot of sense to, to find wherever you can build the efficiencies into the operation. from the airframe design, there's some folks out there who, with traditional engines, are looking at cutting 30 to 50 percent of the fuel burn out of your 7 37 class planes by bringing, blended wing body type airplanes to market. So there, there are ways that you can, by creating a new aircraft, even if you're not changing propulsion, you can get some meaningful efficiency gains as well. At the end of the day, when you achieve fewer economic benefits, it reduces the addressable market for the technology. So, or inverting that, for every percent cost that I save, it opens up more and more market opportunities. So, there's a old story in the industry about a major airline that removed a few pages from their in flight brochure to save a few pounds because that mattered, right? And these are fractions of a percent saving. So in your example of saving 10%, still transformative. For many operations. Now, is it going to be as transformative as saving 40? Nowhere close. Will it still be meaningful? Only if it's economically compelling. And so this is where you look at the conversion. You know, so maybe somebody struggles to retrofit their plane, but if you're buying a brand new plane and you get to choose between, CapEx neutral across the two, the combustion or a hybrid, and that hybrid saves 10 percent on your OpEx, you might still go with the hybrid system because economically that still makes sense. So this could be a factor that delays adoption if the economics don't work out. From an unmanned standpoint, we're already seeing from a drones, eVTOL, or like a Department of Defense type applications some fully electric, uh, or places where the economics don't matter as much, where you know, they're willing to pay a premium for the mission capability. Those are certainly additional early adopter areas where I think, the industry is likely to get a boost, regardless of the fuel savings, a boost in market applicability because of the performance characteristics of these new vehicle types.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is the drone propulsion supply chain overlapping into the propulsion supply chain that you deal with?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, a year and a half ago, we acquired a company's assets, called, the company was named Talyn and Talyn was developing a, effectively a cargo lift drone, and various types of payloads that it could carry. Our propulsion systems fit straight into that cargo drone, straight into traditional, conventional takeoff and landing drones, or eVTOL, for a whole variety of applications. Ampaire's focus is, again, the disagreement place number one. Propulsion is where you begin, and I want to put propulsion across everything. And, yeah, so the same engine types, I mean, there are flavors and variations of engines, but, the major families are applicable across. across the industry, whether it's manned or unmanned.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, tell us a little bit about Ampaire. How do you make money today? How do you make money in five years and 10 years? What's your special sweet spot?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Ampaire is focused on the electrification of aviation, focused on propulsion, specifically hybrid electric propulsion, upgrading existing aircraft types as an entry point into market and using that as a gateway to transition the industry toward lower carbon and better economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Give examples of the type of aircraft that you're converting. I saw a Skymaster as\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>so back in 2019, we flew our very first aircraft type, which is a upgraded Cessna Skymaster push pull configuration. We call that an independent parallel hybrid architecture, where you have one combustion engine, one fully electric. We've also flown the Cessna Grand Caravan, which is with an integrated parallel hybrid architecture that uses a, mechanically coupled electric and combustion set of engines to be a hybrid electric aircraft. That same engine that goes into the Caravan is what we just finished our CDR on the King Air for integrating there. We've got the Twin Otter is a 19 passenger plane in the same category. And there are thousands of planes in market that use this category of engine. So this is our half megawatt class system. We also have a quarter megawatt class system, which is used as a, either a genset or propulsion system for general aviation, drones, and eVTOLs. Now, as a company where we're focused is around the certification of that launch product and the Caravan. The market that adopts that is both passenger carrying and cargo carrying for the commercial industry, but then also we've got a number of contracts with the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Department of Energy. So our money today, our revenue, which is really just offsetting NRE costs, or non recurring engineering costs. We've brought in about 25 million of government contracts. For these, through these government customers, for the development of our propulsion system and the application of that system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're making$500 million in 5 years, who are your primary customers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we scale commercial revenue, this comes from the regional aviation market. These are folks who are currently buying turboprop engines and would instead of overhauling their engine or buying a new engine, would be buying one of Ampaire's hybrid electric amp drives. These amp drives are the ones which save 50 percent fuel burn, and we believe will save on maintenance cost as well. So it'll be good economics for people to switch over to our systems rather than run on their traditional combustion system, and this is where we see the earliest adoption for technology. So begins as retrofits of the existing fleet of turboprops, but then quickly moves into partnering with OEMs, the aircraft manufacturers, for when they build a new airplane, giving it a hybrid option. The next phase is, of course, working on clean sheet design planes with OEMs who are optimizing planes, new designs, around the novel propulsion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Tell us a little bit about your, you have a great history of being an innovator and entrepreneur. Give us some lessons learned to our innovators who are listening today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Kevin:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, it's been eight and a half years at Ampaire. The number one and biggest recommendation I can give is choose something that you deeply love and that you think you can actually achieve. The days get challenging over the course of years as an entrepreneur. It is not easy. It is oftentimes not even fun. But when you know that you're doing the right thing, when you're tackling the most meaningful, challenging, visible problems that you possibly can, it gives the motivation, not just for you as an individual innovator, but truly, these are things done by teams. And when you have meaningful work, and you're thoughtful about it, it enables you to pull together teams of really great people to go do these audacious things. I think the importance of setting tangible and tractable goals that you can actually achieve in the near term is very important. It's not just about moonshots, it's about the steps on how to get there. And, and ultimately, it's about building long standing relationships and not looking for what do I get now or, being short sighted in them, because truly the world is built by people and, and supported by relationships that are built over years or decades. And so, being a good actor in the industry is so important.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, you've acquired companies, you were almost acquired yourself.

In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the opportunity to go public via SPAC was pretty exciting, and there was a whole lot of money on the table, both from company valuations and from operating budgets. But you also have to be willing to change course when it's clear that the course you're on is not the right one, which we did in early 2022. Ampaire pulled out of a deal to go public because we realized that it was, the higher risk path and it was not worth, continuing down that path of going public and getting acquired. These are hard decisions that you need clarity, you need good advisors and mentors to support you on, and ultimately you need to set the ego aside a lot of times and go on good first principles when making your decisions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Kevin, thanks a lot.

A democratizing a mode of transport that was only available to the wealthy. And I'll tell you guys to put a sort of a fine personal point on it. I think that reality for me spending my career in the airline industry, that's been to me the most satisfying aspect working for 50 years in and near airlines is that we have made it possible for everyone to fly. We're cheaper than the Greyhound, we're cheaper than Amtrak, and now people can fly. And isn't that a great thing\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and a conversation with Dr. Rob Britton, principal of AirLearn. Rob has five decades of experience in commercial aviation, and I guarantee regardless of who you are or who you work with, you'll love this discussion. So how to describe this talk? It's a blend of the history and promise of aviation and commercial aviation, the role of hubs and why they started and continue, a reality check on aviation and sustainability, the challenge and opportunities for advanced air mobility with the necessary dash of prudence, and a thorough discussion of regional air mobility. It sounds like a lot, but there's a constant theme, the value and promise of aviation, the power of market forces, the need for innovation and not just in technology with prudent optimism laced through the entire conversation. I had lunch with a few friends last week who loved the podcast. Thanks to you both. And they encourage us to keep the introduction short so our guests can get to the meat of the podcast. So for at least this podcast, we listened. So many thanks to Rob for this uplifting and serious conversation and to our many and growing number of guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Rob Britton as you innovate profitably in The Vertical Space.

Thank you for inviting me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>First question. Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I think that I, because I've been around for so many years, most of my perspectives are fairly well aligned with the industry. I think the one place that sort of jumps to mind, and I'm not sure that it's a disagreement necessarily. I think the industry, is, with respect to, sustainability, climate change, emissions, all that stuff. I think the industry, fails to, in their zeal to talk about how, what they're doing with SAF and what they're doing with, fuel cells and all this other stuff. I think that they really fail to tell what I think of as the balanced story and the way that I would explain what I think of as a balanced story, I is this way when I'm in the business school classroom and I, that's where I spend a lot of my life and I give a lecture, particularly when I'm in Europe, and inevitably in Europe, somebody's going to ask me about climate change and airlines, and they may even be quite pointed about it. and I always like to say it this way. I start out and I say, look, commercial aviation is responsible for two to three percent of climate change and gas emissions. It's not 20 percent. It's not 10 percent. It's two to three. Now that's a small percent, but it's a big number, and nobody's in denial. But what, I like to say is I like to think of it in cost benefit terms. Okay, if we own up To 2 3 percent responsibility for climate change gas. What do we get? And the answer is we get an enormous amount of good. Both in terms of all the great things that commercial aviation enables, whether it's adding value to other economic sectors, allowing businesses to grow, providing a foundation for tourism. All of these, all these things. And I think if you frame it in those terms, it's a good way to frame it and I think that the industry seldom kind of puts it in that direction, I think largely because they're trying to put a happy face on it. And I would rather put an honest face on it to say, okay, yes, we own that, we're trying to make it better, but at the same time, we're adding enormous amounts of good and people want to fly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, what is it about the narrative that you're hearing from airlines that is particularly maybe frustrating is a heavy word, I agree with your point we've poked around this topic in our previous episodes, talking about, whether the allocation of capital towards that goal is really going at the right places and will have the desired outcome when you consider the 2 to 3 percent overall, but also when you double click on it and see, what segments of the market are responsible for most of the emissions. And then you end up with a, 15 percent of a 2. 5% Type of problem on and on. So, so that's one side of the conversation, but the airlines are entities that have been around for a long time. They're smart people. They know the business yet sometimes feel the narrative is out of touch with reality. How do you explain\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, it's a great point and a great question, Luka, and I think you're right. It does seem to be a little bit, out of touch. and I think what my basic complaint about the way they frame it up is that, it's all this sort of, fluffy good news, and nobody's really willing to, put some caveats around it. I'm a, I'm a believer in honesty and I think somebody should You know, I think the airline industry needs to say, yeah, we're, we believe in SAF, but let's be honest. It's not scalable at this point. Right. And even if it were scalable, it's going to be expensive. And so, I think a more forthright discussion, at least in some circles, I mean, they don't have to do it, Scott Kirby doesn't have to talk about that when he's making a presentation to the Sierra Club, right? But at some point, there's got to be, I think, a greater amount of honesty, in the debate. whether we're talking about alternative, whatever it is we're talking about, alternative fuels or, whatever else is going on. And, I mean, at the end of the day I think where I, when I really get pushed into the corner, as I would be, for example, if I'm in front of a bunch of students in Sweden, right, home of Greta Thunberg, if I'm really pushed against it, You know, I start to rail about this idea that it's okay for them to fly, right, if they live in Stockholm, and in December and January it's cold and dark and wet. It's okay for them to go to the Dominican Republic to go on the beach, but somehow it's not okay for, a family in India that has just become middle class to take a journey. And so, I'm wavering a little bit, but I get really cranky about this because I think at the end of the day there's a lot of hypocrisy that surrounds all of what we're talking about here. So all I'm saying is let's get rid of the hypocrisy. Let's get rid of the fluff and let's have honest discussion about what we need to do. Now, having said all that, I mean, the arc of things, as an optimist, and I've been an optimist all my life, the arc of things is moving in the right direction. I mean, people are doing the right things. And Luka, you rightly point out, when it comes to capital allocation, that sort of thing. I mean, it's not a perfect world, but we're sort of, maybe it's not correct to say we're moving in the right direction, but we seem to be lurching in the right direction.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Another thing that we brought up in the past in the podcast is that it feels like the airlines are under pressure to innovate where in fact they are the users and the operators of the technology. Do you see that as well from your perspective, right? People are pointing fingers at airlines and say, well, what about this new, more efficient, aircraft or propulsion system Where in fact, they should be turning to the Prats and the, Rolls of the world. Right. And the same, well, what do you have that I can use so that, we can address some of\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I agree with that completely. Yeah, I mean, I think, I agree with you. I think that's a, I think that's a solid point, Luka, but I, in, in the end, it's one of those things where if an airline were to do that, they would end up just getting dragged through the mud. I, so I think that, it's the sort of sense that, we're all in it together, I think is where we need to be. And that, again, that's, one of the points that I always make. to my students, and that is that everyone in the commercial aviation ecosystem understands what needs to be done. No one is in denial. there's nobody that says, this is not an issue. This is not a problem. And so, we all collectively own the problem, but you're exactly right. The people who are distinctly in a position to fix the problem are the people that manufacture engines, and to a lesser extent, are the people that make airframes. and, I mean, and I want to be sympathetic to them because I think, they're working on all these things. But in the background of all this is what I keep saying, and that is people want to fly. And, if you look at, sometimes I see these sorts of, these sorts of interesting collision courses, if we take, the global scale, I look at, the, I look at the, the order announcements At Farnborough last month, for example, and Indigo, in India, I don't know, it's, I lose track of how many hundreds of airplanes they have on order, but that's the reality, right? India is emerging. People are become more and more Indian people are becoming middle class. Their business sector is sort of growing in spite of itself. and people want to fly. And so what we're going to say to them, no, you can't. yeah. I said, anyway, beaten that horse to death, but it is, it's something that I feel really passionate about in that. And so, come back to answering your first question. I think that's what I would say. I think I have a slightly different, maybe not slightly, maybe a fairly significantly different take on the discussion around sustainability and, and climate change.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah. and Rob, I would say that this is also, we talked about, oh, it's a propulsion problem. It's an airframe problem. That's where the work needs to be done. I would say it may well boil down to being a petrochemical problem because the most effective path to actually achieving this goal, if that's what people want to do, is to be able to preserve all the existing training, all the existing airframes and create a fuel in a new way that works directly in those systems starting tomorrow. And in that case, then, it's a petrochemical problem and it's, it's those people that we need at the table doing this. And then, oh, by the way, if we solve that, if we find a way to create a sustainable, renewable liquid hydrocarbon fuel, especially if we do it without bio based feedstocks. We're doing it from electricity and water and a carbon source. Well, and that's way bigger than just SAF. That is a new energy storage medium and an extremely powerful one, and one that's so differentiated from batteries that we have anchored ourselves to with the entire renewable energy matrix. That would be literally a massive step forward for civilization if we could do that cost effectively and\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It would. And I've, and again, in keeping with my, my, my realism, but sunny optimism, I think that, we are, everything that I read, and I'm not a, I'm not a physicist, but everything that I read is that, the research is very close on, for example, to being able to sustain a controllable fusion reaction and be able to then take that and scale it up. And if that's, I don't know, I'd love to see it in my lifetime. I'm 72. if it happens in my lifetime, I'll be dancing in the streets. but, if we have a time frame that says it's 20 years off or 30 years off, I think absolutely those kinds of breakthroughs are doable in that sense, whether it's a fusion reactor that generates enormous, virtually unlimited amounts of hydrogen, or it's a breakthrough with other kinds of energy sources that will not, add enormous amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere. Let's bring it on. and, there's, it's clear to me that lots and lots of people, way smarter than us are working on this. And the more that we do, the better and the closer we'll be. So I think, we'll get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Your answer to the opening question is, let's have some realism with some sunny optimism, and let's understand the value that aviation is providing. Let's start the answer to sustainability of, let's first of all remember that these are the things we do for society. That you all take advantage of and they play a very important role while understanding that sustainability is something we, we're only two to 3%, but we're focused on it, but it's not something that's gonna happen tomorrow, but you want a balanced, realistic approach while answering the question. That's frankly a little refreshing. So is there anything else you want to talk about on this topic before we move to the next\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, I, I think now, I think the only last thing that I would say is the other thing that makes me absolutely crazy, is when we're singled out, right? When we're thought to be, the only evil polluters that exist in the world. I teach a lot in, I teach a lot in Switzerland, and as they have an enormous dairy industry, right? And as you also know, the world's cattle, have about a 5x impact it's somewhere around 10 percent of climate changing gas, largely from methane that the cows burp. But nobody's going after, the dairy farmer, right? I mean, they are to a, to be fair, there, there are some, green extremists in the Netherlands, which also, they also have a large, dairy industry that are going at this. But I don't want to be singled out. I don't want to be held to be the only evil people around. And particularly in, in the US marketplace where, people still seem to be more than happy to buy enormous pickup trucks, right? And just so you know, we've got a Ford Escape Hybrid that gets 46 miles to the gallon. I ride that bicycle to the grocery store. So, we can't be singled out, and we've got to get back to what you so eloquently say, Jim, and that is this idea of all of this good, and I think to maybe wind this up, that's the part of the story that we're not telling. All of this good.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We should have an episode on those bastard cows, coming out.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what I always say, what I always say to people is, I love milk. I'm from Minnesota, so I grew up drinking milk and eating cheese. I love all that stuff, right? But I'm not going to say, let's get rid of the world's cows. Let's figure out a way to, to redo their biology so they don't burp methane. And we can probably do that in 10 or 20 years, right? Anyway.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I can already tell this is going to be a great discussion, just for the, your answer to the first question. But Rob, give us a perspective, in order to predict what we should be doing in the future we want to understand the past a little bit more. Give us a history of the airline industry, just from a historical overview and lessons that you think may apply\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's great, and I'm looking forward to this little history lesson, if you will. So, I mean, and the thing that's interesting about the airline business, and in fact I was teaching this morning, at Georgetown, where I work part time, and I had to explain that it was a group of MBA students, and I had to explain to them that the airline industry, for the first 50 or 60 years of its existence here in the United States and other parts, will look very different from what it looks like today. So here in America, as you guys know, at the dawn of commercial aviation, in order to stimulate the growth of this new technology, the federal government handed out contracts to carry mail by air and then that slowly worked towards carrying people. And somewhere in the late 1920s was the first effort to create a, essentially, a regulated utility model for the airline industry. They were not going to allow the market to do that to make decisions. So what emerged from the Civil Aeronautics Act in whatever it was 1927 or 28 modified through the 1930s was a regulatory regime that was not just operational regulation but economic regulation. And so for 50 years until 1978, a group of lawyers in Washington made all of the commercial decisions for the airline industry. Most fundamentally, could you start an airline? And the answer was almost always no. So they regulated the most fundamental aspect of the business, and that was market entry. Once you were lucky enough to be licensed to be an airline then the federal government, through these lawyers in the Civil Aeronautics Board, which was the name of the entity, told you where you could fly. And so they doled out, essentially, you could think of them as route licenses, right? And those licenses were doled out to two different types of airlines. There were the so called trunk airlines the remaining survivors are American, Delta, and United, but back in the old days there were brands like Eastern, and National, and Continental, and Northwest, and a whole bunch of them. There were the trunk airlines that carried people longer distances, so from Chicago to San Francisco, or from New York to Boston, just from New York to Miami. And then there was a whole network. Fascinating, vast network of what were called local service airlines. And these were brands like I grew up with in Minnesota, North Central Airlines, or it could be West Coast out on the Pacific Northwest, or it could be Allegheny. Or it could be Piedmont, or it could be Ozark, these kind of funky regional names. And these were companies with smaller aircraft serving smaller markets, generally with a nice subsidy from the federal government. So this Civil Aeronautics Board controlled licensing. Once you were licensed, they controlled routes. Sometimes in the case of local routes, and we're probably going to talk about regional mobility sometime in the podcast. So there was a handsome subsidy that, for example, North Central Airlines collected from the federal government to operate a route from Minneapolis St. Paul to Brainerd, Minnesota, to Bemidji, Minnesota, to International Falls. Small communities, 8, 000 people, 9, 000 people. And this network of these local service airlines really, you can, there's a fascinating map that I actually have on my computer, which I could, if you remind me, I'll share with you. That showed you this vast network. So they doled out market entry, they doled out the routes, they doled out the frequency, so they control supply. If you were given what was called, it wasn't really a license, it was called a route award. If you won the route award for new service from say Minneapolis, St. Paul to Denver, which North Central Airlines got that route award in around 1969, the government told you how many flights, not the marketplace says, there's demand for six flights and we're going to meet the marketplace demand. But the government said, we think it's three. And that's what North Central got. They got three flights a day from Minneapolis, St. Paul to Denver. And they were, of course, happy to have the route, because the, the previous incumbent Western Airlines, now part of Delta, had no competition. So they were, they nibbled a little bit toward the end in the period, sort of roughly 1965 to 1978, with a little bit of gentle competition. But the last thing that they controlled, the fourth thing that they controlled, was price. And they set price in a very interesting and comfortable way if you were a producer. They basically set price at whatever the average cost of production would be, plus a guaranteed profit. So for years, the mantra at the Civil Aeronautics Board was I believe that they were going to set fair levels at a point that would produce a 12 percent return on assets, right? it was just bizarre. And so what, so if, and the, and All of that fair setting was done against average cost of production. So if you figured out, if you were a bright guy and you figured out how could I produce this product, Below the average cost of production, you made your investors very happy. And in fact, interestingly enough, cause I come from Minneapolis, St. Paul, that's exactly the model that Northwest Airlines for years pursued. Now they were very clever about that because the long time CEO, this is maybe more detailed than your listeners want, you can just edit it out, but the long time, here's the fun thing, the long time CEO of Northwest Airlines was a guy named Donald W. Nyrup. I actually knew his son quite well. Don Nyrup's previous job, before he became head of Northwest Airlines, was he was a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board. So he, this is classic revolving door, right? He knew exactly how all this worked. And he said, if if I can produce the product cheaper than anybody else, my investors are going to be really happy. And that was exactly the model that they pursued for a long time. So even, with that idea of average cost of production and a nice, built in cushion, companies still found themselves in financial trouble. They couldn't manage the business. And so, for example, in the, I believe, late 1960s, the CAB, went out and engineered, by leaning on Delta, engineered Delta's acquisition of an airline called Northeast. Northeast was on the verge of running out of cash and they said they need help. And, Delta takes over. And there were a couple of other episodes that were like that, in that. So, so this whole thing is micromanaged by a bunch of lawyers on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D. C. And there was this enormous, I mean it was a big, they took up the whole building. And there was, they had economists and they had all kinds of other people, and obviously an army of lawyers and they, this, all of this, all this whole thing set up to make the decisions that would normally be made in the marketplace.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And who were some of the more successful airlines\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I've already mentioned, I've already mentioned Northwest. Northwest was a good one, a Continental. did very well through most of their, through most of their years. Delta was always very astutely managed. and had, they really had a, very, the government basically gave them a very nice route network. So those are sort of three that, three that, that come to mind. So what happens over 50 or 60 years of intrusive government economic regulation? Well, Costs just keep going up and up because there's no competition. There's no Southwest or JetBlue or Spirit placing downward pressure. And all of the older companies, more or less have the same cost structure.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, it's remarkable that this economic regulation of air travel got put in place so early in the infancy of the industry. And my question is, what was the motivation for that? Who was advocating for this economic regulation? Was this coming from the airlines themselves? Was this to protect their profits? Or was this coming from the government? Or was this just an outgrowth of how society thought about regulation at that point in the 20th century?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The principal issue at hand was in the 1920s and even into the 30s, the planes were falling out of the sky and it was not the safe industry that we, the astonishingly safe industry that we have today. And so the impetus for regulation originally was all driven around safety. And the logic that was able to be sold to politicians in Washington, to the media, to the person in the street, the man or woman in the street, was if we allow the market to decide, if we allow competition in this industry, some company is going to get into financial trouble and they're going to cut corners on maintenance. They're going to cut corners on pilot training and the plane is going to crash and everyone's going to die. That was the kind of logic of the 1920s. Then what happens in October 1929, the stock market crashes and there's this massive meltdown and there's this massive, through the early 1930s, loss of confidence in the genius of the market economy, right, and the, suddenly the market economy is no longer able, the skepticism, both, driven from FDR or whoever else it is, even from, for that matter, moderate Republicans are saying, they can't, we, the marketplace is a good place to be, but it's not perfect. And so certain industries are going to need to be controlled. And so that actually added a layer of legitimacy to this whole regulatory, impetus and it just carried on. And so what's happening? So costs are going up, prices are going up, costs are going up, prices are going up. And essentially the, the reality was, as I said, all of the older airlines, whether they were in the, local service category, Piedmont and Ozark and North Central. Or they were in the trunk category, National and TWA and Western, whoever they were. All of them more or less have, in a range, the same cost structure. Their costs are all going up sort of in lockstep. And so when their costs go up, for example, when the pilots union, and as you know, unions have been a reality in, in, in the transport sector in general, and in, in aviation in particular for decades, the pilots union at United, let's say as an example, in the, 1950s, say, we need a new contract we want to raise. United's management just gave it to them because they knew that they knew two things. First of all they had to do was go to Washington and say our costs just went up. You need to raise fare levels. That was reason one. Reason two was they knew about pattern bargaining. The same reality that exists in automobile manufacturers. When the UAW gets a contract at GM, they take it to Ford. Ford. They take it to Stellantis, and off they go. So the United Pilots knew that the Airline Pilots Association, once they got a deal at United, they were going to shop it to every other airline management group, and all, it goes up and up and up. Then what happens? Boom! Mid 1970s, a nice boom, actually. Mid 1970s, a group of influential economists, led by Professor Alfred Kahn from Cornell University, travel down to Washington, and they say, they meet with the Civil Aeronautics Board, don't get much response. They go up to Capitol Hill, and they say, this is nuts. The technology has been perfected, flying has become safe, planes are basically not crashing anymore, and this mode of transportation, which has essentially been perfected, is available only to the rich. Guys, I've been in this business for 55 years. I started in 1969. as a travel agent to pay for college. My parents were broke and I had to pay for it myself. I was a traveler. When I went out to Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport, the only people I saw at the airport were the well to do. So Alfred Kahn says to the Congress, to whoever will listen, if you deregulate the airline industry and you allow competition to come in, prices will come down and more people will be able to travel. So the impetus was entirely pro consumer. And that's exactly what happened. That's exactly what happened. And so the Airline Deregulation Act is passed on October 24th, 1978, all of this intrusive government regulation starts getting phased out. There's open entry into the industry, provided that of course, you satisfy the basic operational requirements. You get a license to operate. And new airlines are starting up. Routes are opened up. Prices are opened up. Prices and fares immediately come down.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, do you think that early period of economic regulation of air travel was unnecessary? Was it a mistake? Could they have started with regulating safety but not routes and ticket prices?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes, I fervent looking back basically on what I know. They could have created a operational regulatory regime that said, here's what you need to do and then put some teeth into it. That if you fail to do this If you fail to do this and you have an accident that turns out to be traceable back to your negligence, you lose your license. Easy as that, right? So, we can't, you wish that you would have had that kind of mentality. And by the way, guys, as this was not just in the United States. This was global. In fact, it was even, in a very real sense, it was even more intrusive than most of the rest of the world, because the model of the rest of the world was state ownership of the carriers. Now, there is a bad idea, right? Let's put government in charge of Air France or The predecessor of British Airways or just about any airline in the world. But, so it's a great, I mean, I love the musing about, what would have happened and how we would have had far less pain than we have today. Because what has essentially happened since 1978 has been an enormous amount of pain, variably defined, visited upon the older airlines. Because they have, in order to survive have had to figure out a way to lever their costs down in order to get, into a situation that sort of approaches equilibrium with the new players that are coming into the industry. And as you guys know, that lever has mainly been Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which is a very blunt instrument, painful for the workers, painful for retirees, but it has allowed the older airlines, the three remaining older airlines to survive and, to get on with their business. But the fruits of this were evident from the beginning. I mean, you could go back, to the early, late 1970s, early 1980s, and you could see, and I was around back then, and you could, I, you'd see a full page advertisement, in the New York Times for People Express, one of very bold start up carrier saying, we're going to fly you for 59 peak and 39 off peak and people are going, wow, this is really great. And so it has been a remarkable achievement. A democratizing a mode of transport that was only available to the wealthy. And I'll tell you guys to put a sort of a fine personal point on it. I think that reality for me spending my career in the airline industry, that's been to me the most satisfying aspect working for 50 years in and near airlines is that we have made it possible for everyone to fly. We're cheaper than the Greyhound, we're cheaper than Amtrak, and now people can fly. And isn't that a great thing?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'd like to ask you a question about deregulation, but before, I'd like to rewind a little bit and ask whether there were any milestones in the pre deregulation days that you think is worthwhile to call out, whether this is the emergence of the jet age or the point at which air travel became a mass market, perhaps when the contours of today's hub and spoke model\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>35:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think that, well, there's no question that the advent of a jet powered aircraft, with turbine engines that are far more reliable than, than piston engines, was an enormous breakthrough. And so that dating to, 1958 and being perfected then on and through the early to mid to late sixties with not just, new bigger airplanes like DC 8s and 707s flying, but, the emergence of, smaller jet aircraft that could serve smaller communities. That was, that was a huge breakthrough, from a technological standpoint. and there were probably, there were, not probably, there were certainly, smaller, more subtle, things that changed along the way. I mean, I, one of the, one of the things that we sort of, we take for granted today, is, is the emergence of much better weather forecasting, and just, think about that weather forecasting that was really the methodologies and to a certain extent, the technologies that, that were developed during World War II, particularly in, in the European theater of operations, to allow, good weather forecast to enable the B 25s and B 29s to, to bomb strategic targets in, in Germany. So all of that stuff, right, that found its way into the civilian sector. In fact, one of the great early adopters of that technology, that wartime technology was actually, my hometown airline, Northwest. They had a meteorology department, in the late 1940s, that was the envy of the airline industry. They were like, we're on top of this and, we're going to figure this out. So there were those\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And that was the envy of the industry until they merged with Delta. They always had a premier weather forecasting capability. With meteorologists,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. Brilliant. Yeah. And, so there were those kinds of things. Now, over on the economic side, I mean, I think it's worth calling out so that I don't sound like I'm, dumping, just enormous amounts of, of bad stuff on the Civil Aeronautics Board. There were people that were around back then that saw what was going on. People like Will Rist, for example, America's former Government Affairs Senior VP. There, there were people at the CAB. as early as the 1960s, mid 1960s, late 1960s, through the early and mid 1970s, they could kind of see that this was a little bit silly. And they could kind of see that maybe we should allow, maybe we should tinker around a little bit with some experimentation. But It was really just nibbling around. So, you had the emergence, I mean, this is going to sound incredibly quaint to us in, in, in 2024, but, we, you had the emergence of family fares, right? Where, husband and wife, and of course it was a traditional nuclear family, husband and wife, and the kids could go along and the wife got, a one third discount and the kids flew for half fare and, off they went to Disneyland or, go see the Empire State Building. Again, to make this personal and a little bit fun, I first got smitten with the airline industry when I was a teenager, and around the same time that I was smitten by the industry, the Civil Aeronautics Board allowed airlines to offer what were called Youth Standby Fares. So, I could join, and I did, United Airlines, they called it the 12 to 21 club. You were minimum age 12, maximum age 21. If you were in that age window, you could fly for half fare, standby. You couldn't make a booking, but you could fly standby. Oh, and I flew to a lot of places, for half fare. Flying standby, and we know we got stuck once in a while trying to get home or whatever, but for the most part it worked out. So there was a little bit of nibbling along the way, but, nothing, like the, the, what needed to really be.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At what point do you consider the airline industry became a mass industry and when did the hub and spoke\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, well, it's so, it was so, I mean, I'm being, I'm being a little bit, a little hyperbolic when I say that, in the, 1960s and 70s, the only people that could afford to fly with the wealthy. I mean, middle class people were flying and, travel was increasing, travel as a, as a component of discretionary spending was some, was there, in the, in the, in, in the post war boom, as the economy expanded rapidly, what, what did middle class people do? They, they bought a bigger house, they bought the wife a car, and then, once that was all sort of fixed up, they started to travel, so people were traveling and, and it was becoming, it was on its way, to, to becoming, a mass business. Now, around that time, a number of very forward thinking, not a large number, a small number actually of forward thinking companies started saying maybe within this constraint of the federal government of the Civil Aeronautics Board handing out routes, maybe we could organize a route network in a way that enabled the evolution of the hub. Right. And of course, the pioneer in this was Delta Airlines. I mean, you go down to Atlanta, Hartsfield Jackson Airport today, and you see this massive hub, the biggest one, essentially the biggest one in the world. But that hub, it really existed even in the 1960s, right? And as early as the 1960s, people in the South said, when you die You might go to heaven, or you might go to hell, but you're probably going to get through Atlanta. So they had that idea down, and that's what they had. Now, interestingly, and to be fair, United did a little bit of that hubbing at Chicago and Northwest did a little bit of that hubbing at Minneapolis St. Paul, and Continental did a little bit. Nobody had anything quite as well developed as Delta. Now, fast forward to, October 1978 and the deregulation of routes and the idea that now an airline could configure their routes in a way that made business sense. And the hub and spoke model then emerged very quickly as the way to move people around a geographically vast country. People say to me, why do we have these things? And people oftentimes ask that question living in a place like Chicago or Washington or New York where they can fly non stop to anywhere in the world. But if you live in Medford, Oregon, or Tuscaloosa, Alabama, or Traverse City, Michigan, you don't have a non stop to even to Boston or to San Francisco. And so, the hub and spoke concept became, an enormously sensible way to move people across a geographically vast nation like the lower 48 of the United States. And from across, a place where population was pretty broadly distributed. It was, of course, an urban population, but not everyone lived in big metropolitan centers. You might live in Birmingham, Alabama, or in Portland, Oregon. And if you lived in Birmingham or Portland and you were on your way to Sarasota, Florida, there was probably not an airline that could operate that route, even without the constraints to operate that route, go in and make money. I always like to explain it. I was going to actually bring them up today. I was, because I oftentimes bring props to class and I talk about how hub and spoke airline model is really like two funnels where the narrow end of the funnel faces each other and the hub is in the middle of the funnel. So they're collecting traffic from all over, flights coming in. Say Delta, flights are coming in from the west. And they're landing at Atlanta and they're going off to the east or coming in from the south and going to the north. And these hubs are, for the most part, directional. because that's, logically the way that you would organize. So these things end up working really well,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is it a fair observation that once the government control was removed over routes and fares, with the deregulation act in 1978, the major carriers focused on the most profitable routes, which ended up being these trunk routes. And with easier access to the market, you had this emergence of regional airlines that started with code chairing with major airlines and started connecting smaller communities to these larger hubs. And so, is that a point where we really start to see, the concept of a regional airline emerge, and can you talk about how that segment evolved and how they then later ran into\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's Absolutely right. and so to use an example close to home, before deregulation, so in the old regulated environment, an airline called North Central Airlines based in Minneapolis, St. Paul, operated a route, with subsidy, up to northern Minnesota, up to the smaller communities in northern Minnesota. The subsidies, for the most part, went away with deregulation. There was this thing called the Essential Air Services Provision, which was put in. but for the most part, the, airlines needed to find a new model for collecting people from smaller communities. in the old days when there was, when there were aircraft suited to this and there was in some cases subsidy, in some cases a cost structure that allowed airlines to serve these smaller, that was what happened. Very quickly, a company like Northcentral, which now had the freedom to grow, ended up actually merging with a couple of smaller airlines and became an entity, a brand called Republic. They could no longer, and I was around, this is when I got in the business in 1984 they could no longer serve these points economically, these small communities economically. And so they then began, they then turned to these regional airlines that operated on a franchise model, right? Paint your airplanes to look like ours, sign a contract to conform to service standards. We'll take care of of setting the prices, we'll take care of running the commercial side. You get involved with the operational side. And as in the regional airline ecosystem, there's a bunch of different models for how those companies get paid. But for the most part, nowadays, it's what's called fee per departure where the company, whether it's SkyWest or whomever, Air Wisconsin, they get paid. For every flight they, every flight they run and the airline takes care of collecting all the revenue and managing it. And that model got built out. That model really starts to be built not long after deregulation and in, and in fact, some forward thinking, larger airlines like American with their American Eagle brand, and United, with, I think they called it United Express from the get go, starting to franchise with these independent operators, to provide service to these smaller communities, and the whole thing takes off and, 40 years later, we now have this network, that, has evolved, works pretty well, but, as you guys, as you just suggested, has some problems related to the economics of small jet aircraft related to, the salary structures for these smaller companies, so on and so forth. I, again, my sunny optimism says that, a lot of these issues that were being talked about with a lot of vigor five or eight or 10 years ago, about pilot shortages in the regional sector, are for the most part being sorted out and the way it gets sorted out is by raising their salaries. And these companies are able to do that and continue to provide, the kind of service that people want. So the, in the regional environment, I mean, if you think about, if you think about small cities, small communities, small and medium sized communities in the United States, my sense is that the system works pretty well. It's not perfect, but it works pretty well. And there are just for all I've, while I've got this, there have been a number of different models. that have been tried. I mentioned, the so called essential air services model that the federal government administers, which basically is, for the most part, a failure. To me, when we're talking about regional air service, the most successful model in my view is something called the minimum revenue guarantee. And this concept was actually pioneered in resort towns in the Mountain West that were seeking to have a greater sense of reliable air service. And so I believe that the first resort towns that pursued this is winter resort towns, were Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Vail, Colorado. And this goes back to the late eighties or early nineties, and they contracted with American and American came up with this minimum revenue guarantee concept. They said, well, how much service do you want from where? And they said, well, you know what we want one flight from Dallas, one from Chicago, blah, blah, blah, blah. So American came up with it with a number that they needed, which was basically their costs probably with, and with some baked in profit. And they gave them the number and they said to the resort and it was usually done through a chamber of commerce or a local economic development authority or some either private or public private partnership. They said, look, here's the number. we'll market the flights. We'll sell the flights. And at the end of the year, we'll just do the numbers. And if you meet the revenue threshold, you're golden and if you don't, you write us a check to make us whole. The interesting thing about those, the way those structures are is that, as I recall, the airline didn't give anything back if they wildly exceeded the guarantee. So, and they started, so they started out doing this for tourism destinations, and then they widened it out and, for example, one of the more recent just ordinary communities was a place called Roswell, New Mexico, town of, I don't know, 20,000 people in eastern New Mexico. This goes back about a dozen years, and at that point, rather than American doing it with their mainline, because their, those planes would have been too big, they did it through their Eagle Regional Airline, and it was the same concept they said to the city of Roswell or whoever it was out there that was doing this. Look, here's what we need. And off they went, and it has worked spectacularly well. It's worked so well, in fact, that the initial service pattern was from Roswell East to the big hub in Dallas, Fort Worth. And I believe, and you could check the schedules, but I believe that they've since built it out to it, to have at least one or two flights from Los Angeles of all places. So, here's this little town and the dusty high plains of New Mexico with pretty nice connectivity. That model has been very successful and has in fact been used by a number of other airlines. And just to finish that concept off, you guys may be aware there's actually a number of consulting firms that work with local communities to try to build air service. And this minimum revenue guarantee. concept is just one of the many things that are in their arsenal. And these are both for sort of tourism dependent communities, as well as, as well as just sort of ordinary places. So that's an interesting concept. What I like about it is it's a market based concept. It's not something, where the government's going to come in, where there's going to be a lot of political shenanigans and pork belly, pork barrel stuff. And so it's a nice solution and it has been very successful for the communities that have pursued it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>How prevalent is the use of that mechanism today?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, it's still, and so the other, so carrying that forward, one of the interesting things is that in a number of these, resort communities they started off with the minimum revenue guarantee and they were just able to be weaned off of it because, you know, the market, the route got built up, the service got built up, so on and so forth. In addition to American, I, quite honestly guys, I don't know who else is pursuing it besides, yeah, I'm pretty sure that Alaska Airlines has, I don't know if they're still doing it in the winter from, I believe, Seattle into some of the interior ski destinations in British Columbia, a place called Kamloops, which has a couple of, smaller, but growing ski resorts. And then the other people that are using it, I believe in Canada, in Eastern Canada is Porter. You may know about them, Porter Airlines. they, they're, historically a Q400 operator, but now they've just recently taken delivery of E195s and are building out their service pattern. But Porter was running, I believe, a minimum revenue guarantee into a number of ski resorts in Quebec and in Eastern Canada.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So we talked about regional air travel, how they came to exist, and the kinds of pressures that they have started to feel over the last maybe two decades or so. What's your assessment of the current state of regional air travel, and are you seeing opportunity in new technology, whether this is electric propulsion or increasing autonomy to remove some of the economic pressure that caused the contraction of this segment?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp>My sense is that if we think about conventional small jet technology, I think the service patterns that, companies like SkyWest or Air Wisconsin or the owned subsidiaries like Delta's, company Endeavor. That whole thing seems to be fairly stable. And again, I'm, I confess I'm a little bit removed from some of the to and fro on that, but I'm not seeing, for example, in the airline, trade publications, the industry publications like Aviation Week or Aviation Day. I'm not really seeing, people squawking about pilot shortage and so on and so forth. And as I suggested earlier on in the conversation, I think that, a lot of the pilot shortage of 5, 6, 10 years ago was really related to money. Once they've given these guys a raise and a signing bonus, they don't seem to be having much trouble attracting young pilots into the system. And I know for a fact that all of the regionals recruit very heavily in those universities that have ab initio pilot training programs, like the University of North Dakota or the University of Nebraska, Omaha, and. there's a handful of schools that, four year universities that do that. So I think that's, so full stop, let's shift now and, look at the new technology on the horizon. And, even though some of it seems, a bit further out, it's pretty clear that, companies like Heart, Aerospace in Sweden, building out these 30 passenger hybrid, aircraft. I think this is very exciting because my sense and I haven't seen any data, but my sense just maybe in a very simplistic sense as an owner of a hybrid automobile my sense is that the economics of a hybrid aircraft with a, 30 passenger and, I'm sure once they're successful with that, they'll build it up to, 50 is very exciting. And so you've got that as just sort of hybrid propulsion, the, and again, my knowledge of the players is small, but there's, I know that there's a handful of people that are building out, a pure battery solution, in a, in a smaller package. And that stuff, I mean, that's all very exciting because I think that, that will at least start to attack the, fuel related part of operating into small communities with, with RJs. The interesting thing, if we take this sort of long view of regional service, long being say 40 years, if we go back and look at the operating economics of a, of an airplane, like the Saab 340, that was a very economical airplane to operate in terms of fuel burn, 30 passengers, as I recall, something like that, and then, the, the pure jet aircraft that Bombardier was delivering started to come on and Embraer and, you know, all of a sudden those became very popular. But you know, What happens when oil spikes up? A lot of those aircrafts start to get a little bit marginal, especially in the 50 seat range. So, so the new technology, whether hybrid or pure battery, I think will at least address, some of the energy related issues. And if that's addressed and the labor issues are sort of sorted out, then I think, the prospect looks pretty bright. And indeed, depending on, where things go with, with autonomous, operation, you could start to see something looking very attractive in terms of being able to serve smaller communities. I mean, to me, it's not entirely impossible to foresee a regional airline map that looked more like what it did in the regulated period when all that service was so massively subsidized. So that let's say a city of 10 or 15, 000 people in the Great Plains could expect to have connectivity to a major hub.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, do you think that the hybrid or electric capability why should they better serve those communities in the future? If they're profitable routes, today they could be served from a gas turbine engine. Why do they have to be electric or hybrid?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>no, yeah, I'm not, yeah, I'm not sure I was clear enough. No, what I think I was saying is that for example, a hybrid airplane might be able to provide, supplemental service to, a city that has jet service, so imagine, I don't know, I'm going to take an example. Let's take, let's take Bismarck, North Dakota, the capital of North Dakota. They probably enjoy, I haven't, I'm looking at a schedule, but Delta Connection flies to Bismarck, probably four times a day, five times a day from Minneapolis, St. Paul, from their big hub there. Maybe with a hybrid aircraft, they could serve, they could add some trips in the middle of the day. Alternately, there might be the possibility that the attractive, energy economics of these newer, of this new technology might allow a service to places that don't have it today that would very much like to have it. And you could conceive of a combination of what we spoke about a moment ago, a minimum revenue guarantee. So now let's go down to a, a very small city of say 15, 000 people, and maybe it's just an ordinary place. Maybe it's a resort place or a tourism dependent place. Now they could contract with SkyWest or Air Wisconsin or whomever to bring in a 30 passenger hybrid airplane into a very small place. So you might actually see more dots on the map. And again, hard to know where we would be, but at least what I know about the, the potential economics of these things, that would be, that's not infeasible. So I hope, does that help a little bit?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>does, thanks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, has Heart announced what their efficiency gain or operating cost will be for that 30 person aircraft? I mean, I'm curious as what is it relative to like a narrow body jet, like a 737 or an A320, and what is it relative to another 30 person aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I don't know what that is, but I would encourage you to look. I just, I remember about four or five months ago, I was actually, I was teaching over in Europe and somebody mentioned, they said, there's this Swedish company that's working. So I dug it out and I looked very briefly at their website. So I'd encourage you to, they're called Heart Aerospace and they're in Gothenburg, Sweden. and I bet they've got some, I mean, there's probably some promises there, and as you guys know, it's always once the aircraft is in service that where you really see whether it's actually performing to the promised economics, and I could tell you a lot of funny stories about that, in conventional aircraft, but, I suspect it's going to be a pretty significant, efficiency gain and especially vis a vis, anything in that category. And, the problem guys is that basically that 30 passenger, aircraft size has basically gone away. There's nobody, there's almost nobody flying something like that anymore. I mean, there's a couple of small operators that are keeping, Beach 1900s in the air that are about, 20 passengers. So, they might find a niche is\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is it because the market doesn't exist?

I mean, I think that, you could look at the small end of a regional aircraft and there's really nothing there anymore. And so I, I think that they're onto something. With a, with a 30 seat airplane. And I have to believe that they'd, once they prove that they'd build it out to a larger capacity. And if they do that, I think they're going to have economics. it's a turboprop as I understand it. and if it's a speedy turboprop, the block times into a, you know, on a 200 or 300 mile service are going to be pretty comparable to a pure jet.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp>CHAT GPT says it's a 30 percent reduction in operating cost compared to traditional regional jets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, there you have\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>true, then it must be\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, that's exactly right.

Assuming that new technology comes online and now we have electrified aircraft that, lower the cost per flight or a per mile, whatever is more relevant for regional air travel. And, and this value generated for airline, how does the airline get to keep that value? Do we end up in a situation where the business model changes, where OEMs become the operators, and now they have this privileged access to this cornered resource, and they get to keep the added profits. Or will it be, everybody has access to these aircraft, so now we're back to the usual, low profitability airline models. How do you think that this will change the structure of the network and the overall profit distribution along the value chain?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, that's a super interesting question, guys. and, the, I was smiling when you, and when you introduced it, because, one of the things that I tell my business school students is that if we look at the commercial aviation value chain, once you get to the people that actually operate the stuff, there's not much left over. It's all the other guys that are taking, their generous slices of the pie. but you throw out a really intriguing idea, that, I mean, you'd have to go back to, almost to the dawn of commercial aviation when there were in fact OEMs that were the operators. That model does not exist, has not existed, and it's an intriguing idea. I suspect at the end of the day, and again, who knows, I've never been very good at prediction, but at the end of the day, even though the concept might be there, the notion that the manufacturer would actually then become the operator, I don't know, it's a little tricky. Just because I think, the OEMs, they could conceivably go in and say, okay, we're gonna, we're going to operate, let's take, let's just muse for a moment, since this is a thought experiment, let's just muse for a moment and say that these guys Heart they're building airplanes in Sweden. And Sweden is a geographically large, but empty country central places, there are small cities of 10 or 20, 000 people throughout the country that want to get to Stockholm to go shopping or see a show or whatever, do business in the capital. So you could conceive that Heart would say, we're going to make the airplane and we're going to operate the airplane in Sweden, right? And so, they get an operating license from, the Swedish government and they start flying. It's conceivable they could make that work, but at the same time, they're going to want to sell that airplane globally. And I can't foresee that, a relatively small company is going to want to ramp up. There's nothing that would keep them from doing that, but would want to ramp up and become, if you will, a global operator, all over with, with operating licenses and, 20, 30, 40 countries, but it's not out of the question. I mean, but it's a interesting possibility. If we look at the history of commercial aviation, though, I think we see a situation where, the, what was that, the wonderful phrase that one of the, business savants of the early 80s, always talked about, maybe it was Jack Welch or somebody like that, always talked about stick to the knitting. In other words, let's focus on doing the things that we know how to do best. And so, the OEMs make the airplanes and the commercial airlines operate them and there's not much in between. But again, nothing to keep them from trying that out as a model.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What do you think, needs to happen either with technology or the market side that would enable and accelerate the point to point network topology as opposed to the hub and spoke?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, well, I think that I think you're already seeing some successful business models here in the United States, airline business models, where the point to point, is the nature of the route structure. and it's, it's basically David Neeleman with Breeze and, and the guys at Avelo both of those companies, which, I always like to point out to my students, my Either in a moment of incredible bravery or stupidity, both of those airlines took wing during the pandemic and they're growing like crazy, right? And, they have picked out opportunistic places like New Haven, Connecticut and Burbank, California, Hollywood, Burbank Airport for Avelo. Neeleman is getting as big as he can in, in Westchester County, but as that airport is constrained, but he's finding these places where, you've got a pool of, a pool of, middle class, upper middle class, well to do people that want to travel and that they don't want to drive to and get stuck in traffic, making their way to LAX or JFK or whatever. So, so you're seeing some of this going on. Now, the reality is that, as the hub and spoke behemoths, Delta, United and American, every time they get a new regional jet or, either it's one of their owned companies or a franchise, every time one of those new aircraft are delivered, the economics of a hub say, put it into the hub and add another spoke. But these point to point guys are out there in the thing about, and where Breeze and Avelo are different is Avelo is, strictly single aircraft type 737 800. but Neeleman has found the sweet spot with the astonishing economics of the A220. and that plane has just astonishingly low seat mile costs. My friend, Ben Baldanza, who is on the JetBlue board we were having coffee a couple of years ago and we were talking about the A220 because JetBlue is now putting it into service, replacing their E190s. And their, the seat mile cost of the A220 is like 50 percent of what the E190 was. So with economics like that you're probably going to end with the capability of that airplane it's not just low seat mount cost. It's the fact that airplane has the range capability to go coast to coast. Neeleman is flying Breeze airplanes from Westchester to San Francisco and and Los Angeles. And so you can conceive of people looking at, at flows, traffic flows in the United States and finding, and this is what, I mean, Neeleman is doing this right now with the A220, finding, what's the next opportunity? And I think you could probably foresee some other people wanting to jump into that business with that particular airplane, because it is so capable and so economic and, we're, we're, we could conceivably see some additional sort of conventional, if you will, jet, turbine powered jet aircraft like that. But, we're starting, as you guys know, we're starting to approach, the laws of thermodynamics in terms of how much more efficiency can we extract from a gas turbine engine but, it's conceivable that somebody might get in and, build an airplane that's maybe even smaller than an A220, maybe it's a hybrid airplane, the, people are, people are clever and they're finding new things to do.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, I'd like to get your thoughts on the viability of the on demand airline model. There have been many attempts in the past, none really successful, yet entrepreneurs continue to try. Do you think the assets can be utilized enough to make these on-demand routes possible? Are new, cheaper aircraft the solution, or is it a structural problem that's tough to fix?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I think it's a, I think it's tough to fix. I think you could see a way to have a limited success in, a small array of markets. And the problem with that is that, you then need to find demand that only needs to go in those limited numbers of markets, so people traveling up and down between Los Angeles and the Bay Area, I don't even know if that on demand outfit is still flying out on the way out in those markets in California. I mean, it could exist. It's limited. And you get other kinds of, you get other kinds of on demand models. I mean, if we're talking about, for example, Wheels Up, that Delta has just sunk a bunch more money into, you just wonder about whether they can, whether they can actually make that work vis a vis, the other kinds of, models that, that exist in, if you will, business aviation, the NetJets and the rest of those kinds of things. I mean, Wheels Up, if you look at their, if you look at their concept, if you look at their website, you look at thinking, well, there's got to be a market for that. And yet, they've struggled. I think to be honest with you guys, just not to, I know a little bit about them because I was working for a couple of years with a marketing professor at Wharton that I know very well. And we had, he was wanting to write a, Harvard case study about Wheels Up. And so we had a bunch of conversations with their chief marketing officer. It was pretty clear that even though they might have had a pretty good concept, they didn't really have an idea of how to go in and tap the market. So I, I think that, I think what ends up happening, and I think maybe to your question, Luka, about sort of structural issues. I mean, I, I'm a, most of my career in the airline business has been on the marketing and planning side. And I just, I think to myself, there's just, there's something about these on demand services that it just somehow, it's not a question of awareness because the people who are very affluent, that can afford to, travel this way, know about these things, but they've never been able to really get traction. So, I don't know, but having said that, if you put that, if you put the on demand concept together with, the array of new technology that's coming at us at a fairly rapid clip, you may possibly see in the future, some of these companies beginning to get traction, depending on how they do it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So given that you're talking about regional immobility, you're talking about on demand, how do you see the next 10 years playing out? What's a high probability occurrence as it relates to the commercial airlines, the introduction of electric hybrid, potentially eVTOL, STOL. And, what do you think is likely to occur\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, yeah, step one is that all of this stuff that's being developed, has to be built, and it has to be certified. And you guys know that, certification is not an easy task, these guys will get there. And so once the stuff is built and certified, I, I think you're going to find buyers. I mean, there are, as the big players have made token investments in a lot of this new technology, and so, they're, people are ready for this stuff. If we take it down to the scale of the regional network, I think it's, it's, it's my sense is that it's sort of field of dreams if you build it, they will come if somebody is out there and I'll just come back to Heart for a minute because I'm much taken with this idea of a hybrid. if they start delivering this airplane and it's, it's fulfilling the economics that, that they're doing. I think you're going to see some interesting stuff, but, I don't know, guys, I, maybe it's the function of fact that I'm 72 years old, but, 10 years, it strikes me that things in commercial aviation tend to move fairly slowly. So, I could foresee that by 2034 we're not going to see revolutionary changes, and especially, if we start to look at, you know, UAM and stuff like that, where there's just so many institutional barriers, so many political barriers, the, as you guys know, the pilot union is already spending a lot of money in Washington saying, we're never going to, you guys can never allow a commercial aircraft, no matter how big or small, to be operated without people piloting it, right? So there's just, you just, I tend to be, and maybe it's a function of the fact that I live 10 miles from the capital of the Republic and all the regulatory and political apparatus, but I'm a little bit skeptical about some of that stuff. So, I don't know. I think we're gonna, I think if I crystal ball 2034, I'm going to see some interesting changes on the margin, but I'm not seeing anything really revolutionary.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Rob, decarbonization aside, what are some of the most important challenges that the airline industry is facing and grappling with today that, we'll need to find a solution to in the coming years?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:14:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I think that, for older companies, whether we're talking about the three legacies in the United States, and certainly all of the older companies in Europe, the labor cost issue, has been, for 50 years or longer and continues to be, a big deal. Right. And, you've got powerful trade unions, that, that have a lock, and institutionalized and guaranteed through law lock on contracts with legacy carriers here and in Europe and, they all want more money. And so you've got, that, that is, to me, again, as a long time observer for older companies, that's absolutely where it is, it's the cost pressures continue to be there. What else has gone on? I mean, we've, we simply have to, and I don't want to minimize this because it's huge. We simply have to find a way in the United States to split off, as they have done in most other industrial countries, the air traffic control function. the whole ATC system is held together with duct tape and bailing wire. And it's just, it's just got to be modernized and it will never be modernized under the current regime of being operated by the FAA.

I mean, you've got infrastructure challenges in, all of the big airports, there's not enough runway capacity, there's not enough terminal capacity, and so, the, Pete Buttigieg's solution to that is, well, let's, let's constrain the legacy carriers from continuing to grow at O'Hare or Kennedy or whatever, rather than the obvious solution is let's build more aviation infrastructure. But of course, politically, they can't do that because, there's, all these people whining about carbon emissions and all the rest of that. So, it's just, to sort of conclude, it continues to be a fascinating industry because there is just so many moving parts, not the least of which is the continued intrusiveness of national governments and the operation of the industry.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You've been given a hundred million dollars and you have to invest it in the industry. The return has to come within 10 years. What's going to get the bulk of the investment? What's not going to get any investment?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Wow. I, I get it. I think it depends, I think that's a really hard question to, to answer because it depends on who's holding the wallet with the hundred million dollars in it, right? I mean, if it's a, if it's a legacy carrier, they're gonna buy, they're gonna buy increasingly fuel efficient and capable new aircraft at the, at the larger size of the spectrum. So, the A350 or whatever, they're gonna buy A321s in the middle size. They're probably gonna start to build out more of these A220 smaller aircraft. if you're a, if you're a startup, and you're holding the 100 million wallet, you're gonna, you're gonna be buying, A220s, and you're going to be buying, these, these new, these newer propulsion technologies, hybrids or pure battery to the extent that they're able to be demonstrated to be effective and safe and stuff. And so, I wish I could be more, I wish I could be more articulate there, but as you guys know, I'm not a finance guy.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, but you're a lot. Listen, there are a lot of people listening, Rob, who may not know you, who are thinking, this guy's unbelievable. And they're, they think this podcast is a great discussion. Talk, tell a little bit about what you're doing today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I still do, a little bit of consulting in the sector. And I think that the companies that come to me, are people that want a holistic understanding of how the airline business works somebody with some gravitas and gray hair, and I have a gray hair, not very much of it. But I, I'm, I'm a person that when I approach a, a challenge when I'm given a business problem by a big company like Delta or a smaller manufacturer or a startup software company, I try to look at the problem holistically and I try to bring together, marshal together all of the experience that I have, in understanding how the airline business works. So, if somebody comes to me with this, what they believe to be an absolutely sterling idea about to, bewilderingly new technology. I have to give them a cautionary tale about certification and how long it takes to get stuff done by the government. So, so that's the sort of put over on that side. The other thing that I really do apart from, what takes up a lot of my time and that's being a invited guest lecturer in business school classrooms because I derive an enormous amount of joy from that. But the other thing that I do on the consulting side is, people hire me to explain how the business works to newcomers. And so just as an example of that, one of the big legacies, brought me in a year ago because they had just brought some new VPs on board that had come from outside of, the airline business and they needed to get up to speed very quickly. And that's what I do. I can explain how, airlines work. And so I sort of can deliver an Airlines 101 to an airline company, to a supplier, to an airport. I'm doing, that's, yeah, so that's kind of what I do.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>do it, you would do it very effectively, just based on our talk, Rob.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>thank you. so much.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You've been doing this for a while, as you've reminded us. Who are some people that have knocked you over in the last 50 years who you think are the top couple in the industry? And then who are some people today that you pay a lot of attention to?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I think, look, I don't know either. I don't know the Avelo guys at all. I, the guy that's the CEO is the former chief financial officer of United. I don't, but he, those people are obviously very brave people. They're knocking me over right now frankly, the whole decision to build out New Haven Airport is just, to me, is just a total stroke of genius. Neeleman with Breeze. I mean, here's a guy that started off in Utah with a little company called Morris Air, sold it to Southwest, started JetBlue, built Jet blew up, left JetBlue, started Azul in Brazil. I mean, this guy's a, he's a, he's a complete, clever guy. And, and there's a lot of other people that are like that, that, that are there that, some of the, the older guys that have been around for a long time, all the, the senior guys at Indigo, have an amazing track record. if I, to be honest, and maybe this is a good place to end, without getting myself in trouble with them place where I used to work at American. I look at Ed Bastian at Delta, is, and his leadership team, are absolutely building, a remarkable company. And, the, yeah, they had a, they had a huge, set back with the whole, the whole cybersecurity blow up with CrowdStrike a month ago. But that's a, and that was painful and it was a ding on their brand, but by and large, their trajectory has been forward and they are producing, probably the world's most consistent airline product. So those are guys that, that I look at. And again, those are all people on the operating side, because that's kind of where I spend most of my time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What have we not asked that you would like to answer?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think you've covered, we've covered a lot. and I've really, I've really enjoyed it. and it's been, it's been a great conversation. If I can help out in the future, you know where to find me.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I do have one quick question, there's a lot of entrepreneurs in the audience. Where would you advise them to go and innovate in the aviation value chain?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rob:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:22:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, I would advise them to go and innovate in places that are realistic. I mean, you guys know that, billions and billions, have been and continue to be invested in, in these new technologies and not all these guys are succeeding. And so we're starting to see shaking out in, in eVTOL and a lot of this other stuff that's there. So if you've got entrepreneurs that are looking to invest, my, my guidance is just be very careful about this and don't believe, the pitch deck, and when you talk to the people and listen to the pitch deck, ask some really hard questions based on the fact that, we're already seeing, a lot of the companies that have attracted billions in venture capital, going belly up. So I, I'm a, I'm a believer in prudence. And I think prudence is a good thing when you've got money to invest.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Maybe that's the headline.

You don't have to worry about passenger egress necessarily, or passenger comforts that don't necessarily play a role in the cargo market. If I was to focus on one area, I'd say that's where the most significant gain for us will be, is products that are really designed around our needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>2:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Welcome back to The Vertical Space, we hope everyone is enjoying their summer, and welcome to our conversation with Jeff Luckett, President and one of the founding members of UPS Flight Forward, a wholly owned UPS Subsidiary. Since our beginning back in 21, we've had a lot of OEMs and providers of services on the podcast, both in advanced air mobility as well as in more traditional aviation. It's always special to hear from people like Jeff and the organizations they represent the buyers and recipients of the value of these organizations making products and services. At the end of the day, it's organizations like UPS who are driving the demand. It's their use cases, their business challenges and opportunities and their cash that drives the funding and building of these vehicles and services. And with UPS, we're talking to one of the trailblazers and leaders and with Jeff, we're talking to their leader as the President of UPS Flight Forward. So listen to this. Jeff talks about evaluating over 850 different companies to determine those who could best meet UPS', challenges and opportunities. So, I bet you want to hear about how he differentiated those who made the cut and those who didn't and what advice he would give to those companies. A consistent theme throughout our discussion are the requirements of cargo centric operations. And the importance of listening to these unique requirements when marketing to organizations like UPS. Jeff believes and he is in the company of many that it's the cargo market that is more likely to more substantially materialize in the early years versus the passenger taxi markets. Jeff starts off discussing what happens on the ground is as important as what's going on in the air. And when you think about the UPS mission, and after listening to Jeff's explanation, you'll have a better understanding as to why. Listen to when Jeff sees his future state aircraft entering service and when he expects them to scale. An important consideration, Jeff discusses why UPS decides to insource and outsource its operations key to understanding some of the roles of future advanced air mobility operations. I like how Jeff describes UPS's role and appetite to invest in integrating aircraft into the NAS and his response draws upon the successful role UPS played with the introduction of ADS-B. So many thanks to Jeff for joining us and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Jeff Luckett as you innovate profitably and The Vertical Space. Jeff Luckett is President and one of the founding members of UPS Flight Forward, a wholly-owned UPS subsidiary incorporated on June 14, 20 19 established to work with regulators and OEMs to move the UAS advanced air mobility industry forward. On September 27th, 2019, UPS Flight Forward became the first company to receive a standard 1 35 air carrier certificate, approved by the FAA for UAS operations and has continued to be an industry leader, accomplishing many of the industry firsts occurring in the US, including the first Part 1 35 UAS revenue delivery in 2019 and the first Part 1 35 UAS revenue BVLOS delivery in 2023. Jeff's responsibilities also include oversight of the UPS Airline Technology Support Group. Prior to his current leadership roles, Jeff's 34 plus year career at UPS has covered several areas, including UPS Airline Flight Operations, Engineering, Network Planning, Long Range Planning and Aircraft Acquisitions. Jeff has also held supporting roles with the UPS Airline Emergency Response Team, DOD CRAF Program and Humanitarian Air Relief Charters. Jeff graduated from University of Louisville and has an MBA in Aviation from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He also served two tours of duty in the U S Navy during the first Gulf War. Jeff, welcome to The Vertical Space. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Great to be on with you all today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes, there's a couple things I could highlight. First, I would say we entered the space and we're really interacting primarily, initially, on the small UAS side, and we believed all along that the lessons that we learn in the small UAS space would apply and help inform, the shift to larger AAM solutions, and we're seeing that, but that was some resistance, I think, we felt early on. The other thing I would highlight is that we believe that the importance of what happens from touchdown to takeoff, is as critically important as what happens in the air for us with the solutions being developed. We're seeing a lot of technology companies develop great solutions that do incredible things in the air, autonomously and sustainable, but it's the solutions that also have to take place for the ground, For it to make sense for us and to be economically viable.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Thanks. Jeff. Talk about smaller UAS and why that was your focus.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So our initial pass at small UAS was kind of dictated by guidelines. So, under 55 pounds was really that initial focus. And we looked at aircraft that fell under that FAA limit at the time and that still had a meaningful payload and range for us. So, really when we think small UAS, it's things for more final mile campus delivery type solutions in a reasonably small geographic area.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I would probably say many listening would be a little bit surprised that UPS, that was the focus because you've created so much noise in the larger spectrum. And then what you're saying is the ground operation is as almost important as the air. Talk about that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Okay. and just the, I guess to go back to the previous question, small UAS was what we were able to do first. there are still no AAM solutions type certified. So it wasn't that we weren't looking at them, but it was a matter of what we had available to us to use. But as we jumped in and started going after those small UAS operations we had to form partnerships and, get that kicked off, but we worked with Matternet on that initial, small UAS, stand up. And that was how we went about getting our Part 135 certificate partnered with Matternet. And that is still our only aircraft on our certificate.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Matternet we've had them on the podcast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Excellent.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So talk about the ground operations. One thing you're doing different is the on to in, the out to off is an area that you're focused on and for some they'll understand why, but talk about that briefly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Sure. So when we look at our current day operations, they're still very labor intensive. And when I say that, we do have the ability to do BVLOS now, but even with that unlock, we have crew members at the ends of each route. The Matternet, as we use it today, requires us to load and unload the aircraft, do pre flight, post flight type inspections, and, reload, batteries for flight. So with all those things in mind, it's still a very labor intensive operation. So we want to see things progress in the industry that allow lighter lift on the ends of the route. And we know Matternet's working on solutions today, and in their Swiss operation, they've got a station that the aircraft interacts with, and that's, moving the direction we're thinking. But, in general, we just need to see the ability to automate more of the process on the ground.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Thank you, Jeff. What are the origins of the mission of UPS Flight Forward? How did it come about and why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Our origins really, we've been an airline now for quite some time, a 121 airline. And as the company leadership started to acknowledge that things are changing and that there's new technologies coming to this industry, that was recognized and a small team was asked to tackle this new frontier, if you will. So UPS Flight Forward was pulled together from a small group of subject matter experts from our 121 Airline. We initially stood up operations, from a part 107 perspective. We pursued our Part 135 certificate and formed a new company, a wholly owned UPS subsidiary. And as all that came together, I would say part of the origin was from an ask from the FAA. The FAA asked us to participate, and we joined the, IPP program in North Carolina as that avenue to help us, integrate into this new space. So, partly an FAA ask and partly leadership acknowledging these new technologies coming to the market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, Jeff, as you looked at this new technology to solve some of the problems that UPS is facing, can you talk about what those main pain points are that UPS was trying to solve with this new generation of aviation.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Absolutely. So, when we look at current day operations, we're challenged with aging aircraft, pilot shortages, which some will debate that topic. Even our own 121 Airline, they've got a line of pilots out the door. But when you look at feeder aircraft operations, part 135 operations, they're challenged every day because as people get their hours, they're moving on, up into, to 121 operations. So we still see that as a problem. And in fact, COVID amplified it because we saw furloughs happen during that time. It delayed training and set back the industry in some ways, and it's still catching up. there were people that chose not to enter that field during COVID because of the scale back, and I don't think we've caught up as an industry. So, the pilot shortages is a key piece, and then just cost in general. What we're seeing is year over year costs increasing fairly significantly, for our small feeder aircraft operations. So these solutions bring new things to the table that can help offset those costs. And we know we're going to have to address some of the aging aircraft, as it stands today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And the impact of the pilot shortage is that more stuff is being moved in the ground or what's the impact of this?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Part of it's cost. I mean, I'd say the biggest driver there is cost, because you're having to pay more to keep people in seats, rather than them progressing onto the 121 space. So, cost is a big piece. we are having, in some cases, we do look at ground as an alternative, but we're a time definite business. So when our next day product arrives at a jet gateway out in our system, if it can't make it on the ground in time, that's where we leverage that feeder aircraft network and it's how we maintain that service to our customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The feeder part of that chain of moving cargo is where most of the problem is today. Is that correct?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we look at the solutions that are coming to market and things we're trying to solve for, I'd say that is the biggest problem that we're looking at today, yes. There's also another angle that we're digging into, and that's new revenue opportunities. One of the challenges that we will have as an industry is paying for the new tech. And if we're just putting it in as a plug and play, to existing operations, that may not be all we need, because our current utilization, these aircraft are based around one rotation a night for our next day product. And that may not support, the cost requirement for these new aircraft. So we're looking at ways to leverage these new technologies and new fleets of aircraft to support new revenue opportunities and potentially offset costs elsewhere.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And just to paint a more vivid picture of how urgent these problems need to be solved, or at least what's the perception at UPS, on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the urgency to introduce these new technologies to solve some of the problems that you're talking about?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Great question. It depends on who you talk to. Within our organization, we're a company of 500, 000 employees and a global footprint. We service 200 countries. So, the feeder aircraft piece of the equation is small in the grand scheme, but it is important. we currently vendor out our aircraft. So, we're relying on that vendor fleet, to support our current feeder aircraft needs. And what we're seeing in that market space is consolidation of both operators, as well as some of the aircraft leaving the market. And I think that's becoming a driver. So we need a solution. And again, if you talk to airline staff that are familiar with our feeder aircraft network, I'd say it's going to fall on the higher end of the importance and then, those that are dealing with the ground volume, probably won't see it as big of a priority, but, again, we're a large organization and I think it's relevant, which party you're talking to and understanding, the needs to make service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If the business justification for the feeder network is the priority, and we talk about the small UAS to start and then larger vehicles afterwards what are the 2 or 3 areas of the next 3 to 5 years where you're saying we're going to get the greatest financial return, and from what vehicles and what would the return be?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:07\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The first bet we've placed is on Beta. We were interested in engaging in the eVTOL Space, and when we look at the aircraft available in the market that are coming to market. We needed something that could hit our mission requirements, and our contract was based on 250 miles of range, a good payload and a volume that was meaningful to us. We know we may not hit all those targets, with the first delivered version of the aircraft. Battery energy density is changing and improving year over year. But what we do know is that from a volume standpoint, the aircraft can hit some of the marks that we need on the lower end of our feeder aircraft spectrum. And what that does for us is in today's world, I mentioned if we fly our next day volume, if it comes through our hub and leaves here on a jet, those jets land at regional airports servicing cities, and once those land, if we can ground the volume on time to its destination, that's what we do. That's typically the cheapest way to handle it. But if you can't, and you have to put that volume on a feeder aircraft, that aircraft is going to fly from that jet gateway to a GA airport in a smaller, super rural town. When it lands, there's going to be a vehicle meet that aircraft, they're going to hand off load the aircraft onto a vehicle, and it's going to drive to one of our centers. And at that center, the volume would be sorted down to the package cars for delivery. In future state, what we would do is take an eVTOL directly from that aircraft arrival, and fly to the center where the volume needs to go. So we take a ground segment out of the mix and reduce the handles of the packages, which we see as a financial benefit on both. And a potential time savings for the network. When we look at other solutions, so we are looking at, retrofitting existing aircraft as well, so there are a lot of missions that we're not going to cover with an eVTOL in today's world, just because of the amount of volume, the payloads required, and the ranges. So for those solutions, retrofitted aircraft may be a great way for us to move forward. And as you look at the industry landscape, many are focused on the Cessna Caravan, and that's a workhorse of our feeder aircraft network. It is still in production, which makes it even more attractive. And there's solutions that are going to help advance both autonomy capabilities for those aircraft and sustainable power plants. So we think, really, there's a great opportunity for savings there and efficiency. When you look at the cost of operating feeder aircraft, and I'm going to generalize this very high level so, those in the industry can dig into the numbers. They may see something slightly different, but high level, if you take the variable costs that we deal with daily and bucket those, you can roughly, create buckets that tie 20 percent to crew, 20 percent to maintenance, and 20 percent of fuel. And that 60%, roughly, of the grand total, are numbers that we can influence with some of these new technologies. So I think that's really a focal point for us when we look at those retrofitted aircraft, taking advantage of something that already exists. But making it better and more efficient. So those are, when we look at eVTOLs and then traditional aircraft, I think that's the two approaches that you'll see us focus on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>19:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Okay, Jeff. And when you look across these different types of aircraft, given how you're going to employ them in your operations, which, what I interpret as, improving the end quality of service, increasing efficiency and saving cost, looking at the different aircraft, what is the early end of the time window when those aircraft will actually deliver the bottom line savings, given their own evolution and scale up and the refinement of their operations? And then what are the other aircraft that are at the outer end of that timeline and how far out is that when those things are going to be delivering these savings for your use case.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So when we look at the industry landscape today, everything's going to be predicated on type certification. When will the FAA approve these solutions? Clean sheet aircraft, in general, I would, will expect to take longer. We've been partnered now with Beta since, 2019 ish timeframe. So, that aircraft is evolving, the production line is there, and they're going to start pushing aircraft out the end, by the end of this year. So, those are happening, but you still have to get through that type certification process. When we look at the retrofit side, those aircraft exist and they're basically going after STCs. So, at least to scale, I think that some of the STCs may move faster than clean sheet aircraft just because more of the aircraft's already accepted, but we hope that they run in parallel. I think you've probably heard about Innovate28 and some of those initiatives to get aircraft moving, in that time horizon with the FAA. And, for me, the 2026 to 2028 time frame is when we expect to see these aircraft entering service and, starting to do meaningful routes in the network and then scaling up from there. So, I don't know if that helps give you the color you're looking for.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>21:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It does. It helps me sort of think about the company's time horizon, in terms of your expectations. And can you walk us through when you decided to embark on this, how you thought about, hey, let's lean in and be an early adopter of this and, in a way, pioneer the operations versus, I'm sure there's another school of thought, in the space that says, hey, why don't we wait until, these are a little more scaled up. We can wait until 2030 or whatever and, and then adopt. How did you guys work through those set of considerations and come to the conclusion to say, all right, we want to lean in?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>22:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp>From UPS's standpoint, this was a clear opportunity for us to take advantage of an invitation from the FAA to participate. And then as we did, we acknowledged that there were several benefits. One, we could set the safety bar. and we've done some of that as we've proceeded with our operations. We're the first carrier to have an FAA accepted, SMS program. So, that was a big step for us and we're working through our ASAP program as we speak. So working with the FAA to know that as these new technologies come to market, they're being done safely. And for us, it's protecting our 121 operation as well. We've got, one of the largest jet air fleets in the world. and when we think about those operations, we want to know that the new technologies coming aren't going to put those at risk. So we kind of wear two hats in that sense. So we've been able to participate in the rulemaking and establishing what safe and good operations look like from the beginning. So I think that's a big piece of it. And then the other significant item is, as we've looked at all the companies out there building these new solutions and creating new opportunities, we're able to inform those products. And we want to inform them from a cargo operator's perspective. the initial eVTOLs were all built around air taxi use cases. And for us, a lot of those cabins don't conform well for package. So for us, being able to, on the front end of solutions being developed to influence those OEMs, to create products that are meaningful to us, I would say is the other big element to the equation.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>23:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, it sounds like your desire is to take some of these advanced aircraft, electric aircraft, and replace some of the feeder routes with it. And, altogether, bypass some of the ground legs in the process. Have you explored the idea of just, changing the paradigm of how cargo is moved, in terms of breaking up a single load that a Caravan might fly into multiple drones and somehow redefine and reimagine the network themselves as opposed to taking a new technology and plugging it into an existing framework.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's a great thought and we have done that work. We've got an operations research team that has helped us develop modeling and simulation efforts and in that process what we're able to do is plug in aircraft specifications, capabilities and cost. And run models that compare the different solutions. So we have undertaken some of those efforts and in some cases, it will choose to replace a larger aircraft with multiple smaller craft and take more volume direct to a specific destination rather than consolidating in some cases. So, yes, I would say that is an opportunity and we continue to evaluate it. I would say. Entry into service, though, will look probably a lot more like plug and play on an existing route, until we get to some sense of scale, and then reimagining the network becomes a bigger opportunity at that point, once, once we're able to scale some of these technologies.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And what are the driving factors that would influence that decision in your modeling and analysis?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We're a time definite service, so we have to know that the solutions are going to meet the time requirements, involved, and then I would say cost is going to be one of the most primary considerations. Anything that we do that's new has to show some return on investment, cost savings or new revenue generation. So I think that's where this is going to become extremely important as well. It's one thing to reduce our carbon footprint, for example, with a sustainable power plant, but if it does so at a higher cost, we've got to weigh that into the equation. So, we're looking at it from all angles, and cost will be a driver, safety will be a primary consideration, and then time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, let's say we, we go to your whiteboard. And on the left side of the whiteboard are the use cases, the business justification and the use cases for where UPS needs enhanced capabilities. On the right hand side are the, it sounds like 850 different companies that you've evaluated to fit those near term, perhaps long term use cases. How many of the 850 we're almost perfectly situated for the use cases you've identified.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>it's a pretty small number. I think that, again, the focus of some of the industry's been on things that aren't in our plans necessarily. So, again, getting people to think about cargo versus air taxi, that was a big issue for us to find solutions that work. What we are seeing and I think becomes extremely important, there are companies that are focused on cargo centric aircraft. And in my career, I've spent time in our aircraft acquisitions division of UPS multiple times. And that's where we evaluate what fits the network need for the air solution part of our network. And there's limited options there. Most of the conversations are with your Boeings and Airbuses of the world. And, they've got a product offering and you're typically, in the past, we've competed those two brands and found the solution that meets the need. But almost in all cases, and when you look at the history of the cargo market, we were getting aircraft that were originally designed for passengers. And for those companies, typically a new production line is based on passenger need first. And then cargo is an afterthought. In many cases, early days, it was all retrofitted aircraft, converted aircraft for freighters. They did start building production freighters with the introduction of some of our early fleet. The 757s was an example of, us entering the market with new, mission built freighters, if you will. But they were born out of a passenger aircraft. So when I look at solutions that come across our inbound. When someone is very keen to think about a product that's centered around the cargo mission, it gets really interesting because you get to take advantage of efficiencies that weren't planned in the original aircraft. You don't have to worry about passenger egress necessarily, or passenger comforts that, don't necessarily play a role in the, the cargo market. If I was to focus on one area, I'd say that's where the most significant gain for us will be is products that are really designed around our needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As you evaluated the 850 and you said there were very few that were cargo centric. Did you go to any of the, let's call them the, the non cargo OEMs, have you made recommendations to them on changes that they should be making, and have any of them changed their ways to adapt to your requirements?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In most cases, I would say the majority of the market has been very receptive to our feedback, and I think that's one of the value ads we bring to the industry. If you talk to people that have met with us, I think they'll tell you we've given them very direct, clear feedback about what's important to us. And it may not align with their core mission. So, and we're okay with that. people are designing aircraft for different reasons and different needs. The air taxis of the world, most of them were already far enough down a path that type certifying their first aircraft isn't going to pivot easily to cargo, version. So it's not that they haven't taken the feedback. But I would say that, there's limited opportunity to adjust aircraft that were already started down that pipeline, where I think there's a huge opportunity is the second generation of these new aircraft. I think people will think about them differently and, we'll see them scale up in size to meet more of a cargo configuration and even larger passenger, consideration. There was one thing I was going to bring up on this topic, though, when you think about the aircraft and what they're capable of, one of the challenges I think that the air taxis are going to see, and we've heard voiced already, is they've built them around the passenger load, but in many cases, they can't accommodate baggage. That's becoming a, I think, a consideration that the amount of baggage that someone will be able to take on an air taxi to get to that mainstream airport. may not align with what they would want to or can bring when they actually get on the jet. So I think that's one of the issues that market will have to address, as they move forward so that, the solution actually makes sense for the customer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Earlier, you mentioned, utilization of the feeder aircraft. Can you talk a little bit about what utilization you expect from this next generation of vehicles and how big of a risk is that in your overall business case?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So right now, our feeder aircraft network, as I mentioned, it's very tightly tied to our next day air network, and when those aircraft land at those regional gateways, that's when we use those feeder aircraft. They do a rotation out. And back. And that one rotation is going to be a challenge to pay for. So, that's where we start looking at how would we utilize these aircraft potentially different. And as the new technologies come in, these advanced air mobility aircraft, they'll start out crewed in most cases. we do know there's a couple OEMs out there that want to start with autonomy capable or remotely piloted aircraft. But in general, they'll start out crewed. But as we do transition to aircraft with capabilities of remote piloting, now you don't lock the asset, or landlock it, I should say, at an airport while the crew's in rest. And that's where I think it can get really interesting for the industry, because, when our CEO looks at things that our company does, one of the terms Carol will say, or phrases she'll use with us, is sweat the asset. And when you buy these, high price, new technology things, you want to be able to use them and make good use of them. So I think that's where we'll look for new use cases. And one of our core principle areas that we're focusing on here at UPS is healthcare. So if we move our normal rotation for the next day volume, and then we have this asset, can we onboard new healthcare revenue for other purposes, time definite goods, but that may not fit into our existing network today. There's also other opportunities. When we look at, especially eVTOLs, and you look at the coastal areas of the U. S. and island chains or geographically challenged areas, it creates new opportunities to connect those communities that otherwise are a much longer ground or even ferry included transit. So I think there's different ways that we can support other business and revenue cases with some of these technologies.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp>J Jeff, did UPS ever consider the use of helicopters for any of these routes or operations in its network? And as you look at eVTOLs to fill this type of a role, is it their reduced operating cost that you anticipate is going to be the lever?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes. So UPS has looked at helicopters in the past. And the prime example I'll use is when our jets arrive in Newark, those aircraft land in today's world, we offload that volume into trucks, and those trucks contend with bridges, tunnels, and traffic to get into the city. In future state, what we would like to do is take an eVTOL from the jet aircraft arrival, and eventually go directly to the roof of the 43rd Street Hub in Manhattan and get that early am custom critical healthcare type volume directly there to the sort facility. We know that's not going to happen right away and there'll be step functions. In today's environment, we know that we're having to look at other solutions like barging some of the volume across to make time and that's not necessarily attractive when you're looking at those early am custom critical type deliveries that we need to get out early in the morning. So, that is a big opportunity for us with those eVTOLs to exercise that capability. That is one of the use cases that we've looked at helicopters for in the past, and the operating expense just doesn't justify. One of the step functions I think we'll see happen though is the Stockyards VertiPort for example. I think people will look to leverage those type sites to get to the city until we graduate further down the road to actually landing on structures again in Manhattan.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>35:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, many of the OEMs or startups that are producing these vehicles reason at this point in time that they want to be the operator. How does UPS think about working with companies that are at that stage? Can that be a fit, or is that not?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>35:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So for our Part 135 operations that I think all these advanced mobility solutions would fall into, we're open to both. We're open to partnering with people that are operators and OEMs. We're also interested in onboarding technologies to our certificate. So I think we can go either path. Our current feeder aircraft fleet is all vendored out. We've got a pool of vendors that have aircraft that we source from. And what we've done in the advanced air mobility space right now is we've tried to, in some ways, play matchmaker. We'll look at vendors that operate for us and new technologies and start to create interest there for onboarding some of the new technologies to their fleets. But we've got very little control over that. And so for us, I think we want to go down both paths. We want to encourage operators to look at new technologies while at the same time. us participate in bringing those to market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What's the healthcare market that you see yourselves going into, and how much of it was driven based on the capabilities of the vehicles that you're talking about?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So UPS is very focused on the healthcare market in general. We've got a whole division of the company that's very focused on healthcare solutions. And for us, we want to be another item on the menu for those healthcare customers where we can provide a service that may not be capable any other way. A lot of these products are time definite. We looked at solutions in the very beginning, that we actually do today in some ways. So, hospital campuses, for example, when you look at small UAS, we've got the opportunity to expedite service for those patients, whether it's their lab samples getting from a clinic to the main hospital lab and being processed in time, that the doctor can diagnose before they leave. I mean, that's a change. We also have done roles where medications are formulated and under hoods and very sterile environments in labs, and then they have to get from there to the clinic. And we've also expedited those movements of those specialty medications for patients using drones. So those are a couple examples of things that we actually do today. As you, you scale up from small UAS, we think there's going to be room for those medium size vehicles to come into play and help balance loads and networks for these health care providers. Stock rotation and expediting those is critically important. These are expensive goods and, as they start to reach maturity, and have to be cycled out, I think that's a way that we can help support some of these customers and providers by expediting those movements\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What is the reason that part 121 owns the jets and the part 135 operation being vendored out and how does that impact your thinking whether to outsource or bring in house some of these AAM vehicles.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we look at our 121 operations, those are very stable operations, meaning the locations we fly to, those don't come and go and ebb and flow that drastically. We see growth. But when we assign a jet to a route in a market, it's meeting a particular demand level and that we see, some pretty significant consistency there. Not that the network doesn't change over time. Our jet fleet is made up of different aircraft types that we can gauge up and down. But when we look at feeder aircraft markets, those are more likely to ebb and flow. During COVID, we saw a flex up. The demand was higher in some of these smaller markets for goods, to be flown, as we saw COVID wrap up, some of that demand subsided. So we can't adjust, as quickly if you own the assets and deploy them. With vendored operations, those are contract driven and we've got the flexibility to increase capacity very quickly or draw back if necessary. And with a pool of providers that, allows a lot of flexibility. So that's kind of why we've gone down that path. The future could look different. And as we look at the mature markets for feeder aircraft that have some consistency, those may be areas that we choose to operate ourselves, but we're open to exploring both paths. And I think it'll be a financial decision in the end, what's more attractive for us to pursue and what solution fits the needs. And you bring in remotely piloted operations, I think that will be a, a differentiator. if you own the asset and you're running a remote operation center that's just staffed, you have the opportunity to keep those assets moving, more of the day at a lower overhead cost than just, another contract for another route. So, I think as these scale up, there is an opportunity to look at the cost differently, with own versus vendored operations.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the common things that we hear when we're talking to entrepreneurs that are, pitching large logistics players like UPS on cargo drones of various sizes, is that, those logistics giants don't really want to engage until there is end to end readiness in the chain. Not quite interested in exploring a few routes here and there. The message appears to be, okay, well, sounds interesting, but come back when we can rely on this a hundred percent and when there's ways that we can plug it in seamlessly and integrate into the existing workflows.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, so for these solutions to really make sense into our networks, they're going to have to be reliable. They're going to have to solve for the mission set that we see today. So reliability will come with, weather capabilities. These aircraft are going to have to be able to fly in the same conditions that traditional feeder aircraft fly in today to service our mission. Our customers won't be happy if there are certain days that we can't service their volume. Obviously, in today's world, there are limitations to existing aircraft, including our jet fleets, and that's kind of understood, but if you create new limitations based on a new aircraft entering service, I don't think that's going to go well. So we, we need these solutions that come mature to the market with the capability of operating in wind and, precip conditions that existing aircraft handle today. And when we think about integrating these new technologies into our network, I mentioned once already that, for us, there's a huge importance on what happens from touchdown to takeoff. It's that window of time that we need to have clear understanding of what's required to make the operation successful. If it's an electric aircraft, that's going to include charging infrastructure, regardless of what type of aircraft, you're going to have to know that plan for fueling it and keeping the aircraft moving. How we interact with the aircraft is another big question. If it's an autonomous, capable, or autonomy related aircraft that's remotely piloted, how does the ground crew know when to approach the aircraft? What functions are performed by the ground crew versus someone remote? And, you think about things as simple as, approaching the aircraft to chock it, opening the aircraft, and then once you've unloaded the aircraft, on the other end, who preflights it? How do you weight and balance the aircraft? How do you ensure that it's conformed with that weight and balance plan? There's a lot of considerations that I think as we want to integrate these new technologies into the network, we've got to be very thoughtful about what happens on the ground. I don't know if that kind of covers what you're looking for there, but that's a huge importance to us.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:28\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Have you come forward to certain OEMs and say, Hey, these are our requirements. Can you build something to these specs as opposed to, inversing the problem and evaluating hundreds of companies and concepts that don't necessarily start from your use case?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>43:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yes, to some degree. We've not gone out to your typical, new entrant OEMs and posed those type questions, but the long term players in the market, we've shared those views with. So yes, we have on the front end talked about what product needs look like for us. And I guess, big picture, we do have established standards that, if we're wanting to tackle the feeder aircraft use case, for example, we do have standards that we will share with those that we meet with about what good looks like. So, it's not just about adapting their current product, but we'll tell them what we're looking for. So, in some cases, as I mentioned, it may not impact their current product offering that they're trying to type certify, but it helps them inform that future aircraft that they have on the drawing board.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, if you're going to scale operations with advanced air mobility vehicles by 2030, do you think you've already talked to the OEMs who are going to be part of that scaling process? Do you think you're already in conversations with those, or do you think a new OEM is going to be at scale by 2030?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's a pretty time consuming process.

What else would you want to tell them to be able to meet the requirements of UPS so that you can scale by 2030, 2035?

And for us, this will be more specific to UPS, when we look at our air network, we are typically volume limited and not payload limited. On our typical fleet, that's what we see come out. And that being said, a lot of the aircraft being built are very sleek and aerodynamic, which is great, but they don't conform to the large volumetric needs that we need. So I think as products come to market, that volume consideration is just as important as payload and range can be, because if you can't contain the volume, the solution may not be an option to even consider.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What else would you tell them?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Focusing on that reliability piece and knowing that what they're bringing to market can meet the same or better reliability standards that we have today, and that safety is also of paramount importance. We want to see this industry successful. And we don't want to see it hit hurdles unintendedly because, corners are cut or safety isn't a priority. So for us, that's one of the most important things. And there's the aircraft side of it, but there's also, some of the infrastructure pieces and whether it's the ground support needs for the fuel or whether it's UTM and the requirements to integrate into the airspace. I think those are all important. So, depending on the vendor type, we're expressing those interests, relevant to the solutions that are being created.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So Jeff, I would imagine that some of the military logistics missions whose requirements are being scoped out and that are being developed for by companies might also serve the mission profile that you describe. Are you seeing a good fit there and do you see a path where the technology is going to mature in the military domain area and fit right into what you guys want to do with it?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We do see some parallels, and I'm excited about those. The challenge for us is that, the military variant aircraft won't have to hit the same type certification requirements that commercial aircraft will. So the paths do look different, but I think the work that's being done with the DoD is extremely important because we've seen a couple of things happen in the industry. We've seen VC money dry up and challenge that vendor pool. We've seen consolidation as a result, and a lot of the efforts going on with DoD projects are a way to fund the industry forward. And I think, of significant importance to them because they have ways to bring new capabilities to the battlefield and support missions differently, and in some cases without putting as many people in harm's way. And for us, I think that's proving grounds that will help create scalable solutions, for the commercial market. So I think there's great benefit there. It's still early. We're very familiar with our partner, Beta, on some of the work they've already done with the military, and I think it's, it will pay dividends, I think, not just for Beta, but others that are participating, because I think it will help fund the progress of their product, and, they're able to do real world use cases ahead of the commercial market. We can participate in proof of concept operations, but they're very limited. The military can put aircraft through their paces and in real world situation, more readily available. it doesn't require all the same.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, that's true. And they can operate them in very different ways than you have to operate in the National Airspace System. When you guys think about flying relatively large autonomous aircraft in the NAS, what are your assumptions around that operation? I mean, I assume it's going to be above 500 feet AGL and so it's going to be interacting with other air traffic. Is this going to be a remotely piloted operation or is it going to be some other level of autonomous flight? How are you guys mapping that out and what are your expectations for what that's going to look like in the coming years?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Sure. So the small UAS operations that we have, current day and expectations moving forward will still be limited to keep those below 400 feet. But when we look at the advanced air mobility solutions that meet our feeder aircraft needs, those do enter that traditionally, crewed aircraft space. We think that the solutions we will start to introduce in many cases, they're going to start crewed and be seamless to ATC as it stands today and other crews in the airspace. We've already see that play out with multiple vendors in proof of concept operations where ATC nor other pilots in the airspace really acknowledge or know the difference between that aircraft in operation versus anything else. And I think that's the goal is a seamless integration. I think there's great promise in what UTM solutions can bring to the table. And, potentially helping bridge the gap between current ATC and what the future could look like. The early state, the goal is to be irrelevant. I've heard, Jeffrey Vincent talk about it, and, he's leading that UAS effort with the FAA and boring is good. When they think about operations in the air, they don't want it to be unique and different. I think they're looking for solutions to fit the mold current day. And then. help evolve what the system in the future actually looks like as you digitize more of the information.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think we have a pretty clear path emerging for what autonomous flight below 400 feet is going to look like. From your perspective, what is the biggest aircraft that we're going to be able to fly down at those altitudes before it gets to the point where everybody says, okay, this has to be pushed up higher for a bunch of safety and operational reasons. What's the biggest aircraft that you expect is going to be flying at or below 400 feet AGL?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you would have asked me that, several years ago, I would have said 55 pounds. I mean, that, that was kind of the standard known and accepted. But as we've seen new aircraft come to market, including Amazon's solution, they're getting larger, right? And I think with those larger solutions, there will have to be determinations on what the use case is, and if they're final mile, they're going to be in that airspace, and, I think as the OEMs look at what's required, and I'll give a couple examples. For small UAS to be successful, you have to get that utilization high, and one of the ways that you can do that is making more than one delivery with an aircraft when it goes out, on a route. So to do that, what we've seen is you're probably going to have to go above 55 pounds. What that upper threshold limit is going to be, I'm not sure. We heard some of the early conversations this week at the FAA Symposium about Part 108, and I think that will help inform what this looks like moving forward. I'm also familiar with the ARC recommendations, a little while back that, I don't know if I'm recalling exactly, but I think it was around 1300 pounds was going to be a limit maybe for Part 108, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're operating in 400 foot and below altitude. So I think there's still a lot to, to play out in the regulatory process to know what that's going to look like. I do think from our perspective, I don't think we would want to use very large aircraft for final mile use cases. I know personally, if I had an aircraft arriving at my home, I think there's limits to what I would want to see above my home, and I think that'll start to inform some of it. Right now, a lot of the activity going on in Dallas, at the site city efforts for UTM, I think that's going to be very informative to the industry to see how those start to take shape. Several operators, same airspace, delivering a variety of products to a pretty broad array of customers. So I think we'll learn more as that plays out and the rulemaking processes as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>54:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, certainly it's a big question in my mind and the people that I've been speaking with in terms of, okay, where is that upper gross weight limit going to be placed for beyond visual line of sight flight, according to part 108, whether it's below 400 feet, which is one scenario or up higher. Agree with you that, a 500 pound aircraft going and doing a last mile delivery over someone's house, that's just going to be too loud. That's not going to be accepted. And there are probably few use cases where that would even be required. But for long range logistics missions that are between, other points, like a depot or something, then you could see a use case for a substantial aircraft making that journey. And it would be simplified, because we have the rules already emerging if you can fly it according to part 108, and especially if you can fly it at 400 feet or below, but I haven't seen a lot of clarity on what that's going to look like yet from the people in the community.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Yeah, I mean, just my personal opinion is I don't think we'll see those larger aircraft in that 400 foot and below altitude. I think that'll be, more so restricted to the final mile type path. Now, again, the 55 pound limit that we've talked about and that has existed, I think that threshold is going to be too limiting. So I do think it'll go north of that. We, as I mentioned, delivering one, more than one package on a trip. I think that's a capability that could be needed. And then you also start thinking about the onboard detect and avoid capabilities that you want to have on the aircraft, and all of that just competes for real estate. So, I could easily see, like I said, the solutions going north of that 55 pounds, but, that upper bound limit, yeah, I think as you approach that hundred pound mark, I think that's going to be a ceiling somewhere in that ballpark is just my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Is your expectation that this will be spelled out in the anticipated Part 108 NPRM that we're waiting for?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I would hope so.

And I think that's a good example of how we wanted to see new technologies evolve, but we understood for it to scale to the global market, we couldn't be the owner, at least it wouldn't necessarily be well received and, so for us, I think helping inform the product is the space that we would be in and then encouraging it's, growth and maturity. But I, at least from my point of view, participating in its, development, deployment view right now at Flight Forward, I would not say we're going to heavily invest in that infrastructure piece, especially when you're thinking about like integration to the NAS. The ground infrastructure, there's places that I think will be important for us to consider. If you're thinking about ground charging infrastructure stations at airports, uh, we'll want to leverage some of the network being built in FBOs, for example, that will have some of that infrastructure. But if we've got certain points in the network that are time critical, we may find that those are locations that we want to put our own, shovels in the ground and, have that capability there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:03\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Just recently the FAA approved certain drone operators to operate within the Mode C veil just based on ADSB In information below 400 feet AGL. What do you think the means of achieving, adequate detect and avoid capability outside of the Mode C veil will look like?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, we, believe it or not, when we first started Flight Forward, we tackled a project out in Utah, that was at a healthcare campus, and our proposal was ADS B as the primary source. We thought we were on a good path and ended up not, being approved for it at the time, so I think we were a little ahead of the game, in our request. But we've always thought that was a good approach to hit a good amount of the population, when you think about those Mode C veil areas, it covers the majority of the population in the United States. Not geography, but population. But to hit the areas outside of those locations, we've already gone down the path, and last November achieved BVLOS using ground based radar. And we're looking at various solutions that allow us that flexibility, and I think it'll be a combination of both. as the industry matures to hit the markets we need, but that's, for us right now, ground based radar is that next solution. And then, as we talked about just earlier, the size of the aircraft is going to dictate what you can have on board. And as the solutions get smaller and lighter weight, if you've got the ability to carry that detect and avoid onboard the aircraft, I think that gets very interesting as well. There's a lot of factors to weigh into that cost of an individual aircraft. Again, the penalties you take from a payload side, but, I think those three paths are clearly what's out there, and they'll all serve their own unique purpose, depending on the environment.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, if you were going to have a redo, let's say it's five years ago, and you're going to define your business cases, and you're going to look at the you anticipated 850 different interviews with different OEMs out there, what would you have done different?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I think, we learned, it took a while to learn this, but we learned that there was what we call vaporware. There was a lot of people we met with that we spent a lot of time, and it, in a lot of cases, they weren't far enough along for us to spend a lot of time with. So I think I would have, you know, and I love the question because, looking in the rear view mirror, you can't change anything but you, you do kind of re-envision decisions and it, in some cases it can help you look forward and make sure that you're doing things that you would've changed in the past. So I think focusing our effort, on more known items, and then also I think earlier on, pushing a little bit more on the AAM solutions to meet needs. What we've, again, what we've found is a lot of the entrants were focused on air taxi. And I think they've, a lot of them have realized that cargo cargo will likely move first before people. And because of that, I think we could have shifted a little focus earlier on just my opinion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And the use cases within UPS, if you had to do it over again, are there use cases you thought would develop within UPS that didn't develop and why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:01:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Well, so final mile, I think, was more challenging than most thought it would be. And we tackled one of the most difficult problems first. So some of our earliest testing involved integrating a drone in a package car. And what we quickly came to learn is that was one of the most complex use cases you could have because you've got a moving point A and point B continuously as the route continues. And at that point in time, a lot of the OEMs were presenting versions of small UAS integrated vehicles. And so I think that was a big learning curve, item for us and the industry. So again, I think it is the small package final mile effort. One of the things that we've learned is that the cost per delivery is a challenge in some cases for small UAS. Depending on the product that's being moved, what we're seeing right now, at least in industry state, to have a return on investment, it's going to have to be a higher value and bring with it a higher required, cost to serve. In the industry, we are seeing other providers deliver things like food and groceries. Some people are willing to pay that premium because they want that just in time service. I think healthcare falls into that category as well, where, there are niches in the market where people are willing to pay that premium. But when we look at how we deliver today, and the efficiency of our drivers, If they're in an urban area, higher population density, they're very effective. Our drivers are great at their job and they can service those high density areas very well. What we also find is as the drivers have to go off of main street USA, the further out they have to go, those rural and super rural, type deliveries, those cost us and them time. And those are the ones that we looked at picking off. But you've got to have enough of those to deliver from a location to make sense of standing up that UAS operation. So those are some things that, we've thought about that. I think there was belief that it would have more applications sooner, and there's been more challenges than expected in that area. And then you layer on top of it weather capability, that's been a challenge, too, that OEMs are starting to solve for, and we're seeing improved aircraft capabilities, but at least at the time of us initiating, there were more challenges than solutions, I would say.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And guys, we've heard some of this on the podcast as well. Some of the pushback and some of the areas where we thought there was traditional use case. Jeff we really appreciate this conversation. Is there anything that you were dying to talk about that we haven't talked about? Or do you just want to get off the podcast?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp>No, it's been a great conversation. It's funny. I could talk all day about these topics. You can just ask my family, But no, these are near and dear topics to me. I think that there's a lot to come in the near term as we see rulemaking start to take shape. And I'm excited to see those things happen because again, for a company like UPS, we follow the rules. We just need the rulebook. and, it's kind of, it's been a tough place for us to really accelerate in when not all the rules exist yet. We've done a lot of things by exemption and, that process is painful and it's really not scalable. So I think as the rulemaking, comes to the market, I think that's going to really help accelerate things for us and others.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So a lot of people would say the UPS is kind of first through the wire when it comes to advanced air mobility use cases. Yeah, obviously, especially in the cargo side. But, if obviously you're one of the leaders, but who does Jeff Luckett listen to as it relates to advanced air mobility or in aviation general, who are the people you pay most attention to?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Wow, that's a great question. There, there are several great partners in the industry. We've clearly had a great partnership with our Beta team. And so, they've brought a lot of industry experts, to their company. and we hear and learn a lot through those partners like Beta. But I would say, last week, as a prime example, I had the opportunity to attend the FAA Symposium, and having key leaders from the FAA and industry, both from an OEM and operator perspective, all in one place that's the venues for me that are most important, where you can actually collaborate and discuss the problems and challenges that we have all in one environment. So I wouldn't say it's any one particular individual that I hang my hat on their opinions, but it's getting industry together and, collaborating in ways that we all help move things forward because, for me if the competition has a win, that's great that's not a problem for us. We want to see everyone succeed because, we really need that to happen for the industry to move forward. And, I don't know. I think that's for me, the collaborative effort getting the right industry players and regulators all together, I think, is a key piece.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, is there anything else you'd like to leave our listeners?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jeff:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As a final thought, it's been very important for us to interact with the OEMs during development, and I just want to refocus on a couple things. First, safety. is critically important for us in the industry to be successful. I think that everyone also needs to focus on solutions that have a return on investment. If we can't prove the ROI, it's not going to be successful. And then the last piece is just to listen to the customers, not just the cargo customers. But, if a solution is being designed, those doing so should really listen to the people that they plan to sell to, because I think if they start earlier in the process in forming the product, the end result's gonna serve everyone's purpose better and be more successful.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Jeff, thanks for joining us.\u003C/p>",

They were \"the guy\". But later, this system integration really enabled them to produce systems that are simply much more performant. If you are not just doing your own manufacturing, but also rather than system integrating components that are produced by other parties, you are actually building all those technology blocks yourself from the chip out and then from within the chip itself, you can start to unlock all these little pockets of efficiency that sit between the black boxes that you would otherwise connect being a system integrator. And it boils down to, in order for these subsystems to be compatible they need to talk over certain protocols, which are designed for interoperability, not necessarily for efficiency, and they're always a compromise. When you have the luxury of owning the black boxes, the two black boxes you need to integrate, then you can open them and you can tweak them and you can optimize for whatever you're optimizing for. And then unlock a tiny bit of efficiency here, tiny bit of efficiency there. And when you look across the whole system, these little efficiencies compound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>2:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">For those in the small UAS space, Orqa is a fairly well known name. Despite maintaining a low public profile, this innovative team from Croatia has been making significant waves in the industry. Starting with ultra low latency, First Person View goggles for the niche drone racing market, Orqa has expanded to build essentially every drone component, including their own drones, through a fully vertically integrated business model. This approach optimizes both cost and performance and is positioning Orqa is a strong Western alternative to DJI. Welcome to another episode of The Vertical Space, where we have the pleasure of speaking with Orqa's CEO and co founder, Srdjan Kovacevic, about the past, present, and future of small UAS in both civilian and defense applications. Srdjan begins by expressing his disagreement with the belief that hardware in the small drone industry will become commoditized. He underscores the crucial role of hardware in achieving peak performance for small aerial robots. And he traces this misconception back to the early days of the consumer drone industry and highlights how DJI's relentless innovation enabled it to dominate the market. The conversation addresses the challenges and opportunities of vertical integration as opposed to system integration, drawing parallels with the mobile phone industry. We delve into specific examples demonstrating the significance of vertical integration in small drones, particularly in the case of ultra low latency video data links. The discussion also explores how market dynamics and geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine are shaping the drone industry. And Srdjan also talks about the intricacies of FPV systems, their application in modern warfare and the potential future developments in drone technology. As mentioned, Srdjan is the CEO and one of the co-founders of Orqa, the world's leading FPV company. Orqa is dedicated to advancing the state of the art in unmanned technologies and remote vision. Before founding Orqa, Srdjan had a distinguished career in the financial industry with over a decade of experience in asset management. He served as the chairman of the management board of Croatia's 150 million Euro sovereign equity fund and was the Head of Risk Management and Compliance at Croatia's largest asset management company. Srdjan earned academic degrees from University of Oxford with a Master's of Science in Mathematical Finance and University of Zagreb with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering He is a certified pension fund manager and certified investment advisor. Enjoy the conversation with Srdjan after a quick sponsor message.

And, if you ask me that fallacy goes back to, 2014 15 so speaking specifically in a small UAS space, in the drone space, right. And I believe you could trace it back to, point where DJI, really, defeated, 3D robotics, and 3D Robotics decided to pivot in software And, despite the, overwhelming proof otherwise, we keep hearing that mantra that, oh, hardware is going to be commodity, so we should focus on software solutions in the drone space, where, it's glaringly obvious that, the way DJI won was by relentlessly focusing on improving hardware from a generation to a generation of the product and, again, I'll say it, neglect hardware at your own peril when it comes to small things that fly. Software a part of the solution, we shouldn't be neglecting software, but I don't think you can achieve the level of performance if you think you can ignore hardware, or run your software somebody else's presumably commoditized hardware.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Why do we hear hardware can be a commodity? And is there any particular part of the hardware that you think is potentially becoming commoditized?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">so I, I think that goes back to the experience that we had with, a PC world or computer world, like hardware is arguably commoditized there, but, then again, it only takes a look at, what Apple is doing to realize that, yeah, hardware can be commoditized, but if you want peak performance, then you need to vertically integrate and you inevitably end up doing your own silicon, which I believe is going to be the case with the small unmanned and by the way, which is what DJI is doing at the moment. In saying that, people are, willfully or unwillingly ignoring, cherry picking the examples that fit to preconceptions. And I think it's just like, one of those things that are so easy to say, so we don't think about when we say them. But I hate hearing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you think that, this argument is true for component level hardware, or are you referring to the art of integrating a hardware product together with all of the, details associated with it, which we will get into more detail later.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>9:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's an interesting observation that you ask it like that, and I think, by saying that hardware is going to be commoditized, we gave up on, the possibility that we can compete with DJI, like a collective, rest of the industry and we're settling for a world of commoditized hardware where, we'll just buy components, that should be interoperable and system integrate them in our own solutions. But it's a good question. And I do think, in a world of other drone manufacturers or other drone systems, arguably the base ecosystems, meaning the Pixhawk universe, or Ardupilot universe, or Betaflight universe. All of these subsets have been driving the development of the software stack, autopilot stack, or flight controller firmware stack towards hardware agnostic solutions to a point where, okay, everybody's running on STM, but like on, on a module level. So I think it's also in specifically in the drone world this approach is actually, giving up on the possibility of competing with DJI which was a fair conclusion up until couple of years ago with decoupling and everything.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">From your perspective, how did we end up in the drone industry where we are today, where DJI dominates in a polarized market, dominating both in terms of growth and product quality, while drone companies in the West are having a hard time competing both in performance and price.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think first of all, we need to agree that DJI is just an amazing engineering company, being started by an amazing founder who relentlessly pursued certain goal and would not accept compromises and infuse the company culture with that sort of attitude. And then, going back, I think again, I'm going to go back to what for me was the pivotal moment in the development of the drone market is 2014, 15 3D robotics coming out with the Solo and then DJI countering with the Phantom. I think that was the turning point where all of us users were finally, able to get a really cheap and highly performant vehicles, drones. And DJI has proven that they're going to be super tough to compete with. And, at the time 3D robotics was one of the most funded Silicon Valley companies. And it was being run just like, pretty much every other Silicon Valley company was run, you do your design and your maybe prototyping on shore. And then, you build wherever it's cheapest. And I think it was the pace of innovation that, that was happening in that space, really just shown how having your manufacturing super close to where your R&amp; D is, that just sets you up, to innovate much more rapidly, to crunch those cycles that you can just out compete anybody else who's trying to do that onshore, offshore kind of approach. DJI started, in Hong Kong, having a vast ecosystem of service providers and manufacturing companies in that local ecosystem certainly helped, but I think this was the, deciding factor that then at the later stages, just, help them compound this advantage and really just, build massive distance between them and everybody else. And, they were just better at building amazing technology to a point where the difference in performance was such that nobody could compete with them. And if like we as work as a, as an FPV company, we felt that, when DJI entered the FPV space, which was incidentally just months after we launched our first product. And I like to say that this was a super scary moment. Imagine you're building an app and your app is, running on an Apple phone. And then Apple decides to, look into that space and all of a sudden that app is part of the standard Apple package. You're pretty much dead, right? So, it felt like that, big 800 pound gorilla, the DJI was entering in a tiny market, which was FPV at the time. And, they were basically able to leverage their influence and access to certain, certain parts of the hardware ecosystem in China in order to provide solutions that were simply out of reach for us. And specifically, this was like, custom built chips that did low latency video, over, over RF, and that was for any other company or almost any other company in the FPV space, that was just completely out of reach from the standpoint of existing know how, access to capital, et cetera, et cetera. So, this is basically an advanced version of what was happening back in 2014. It's just access to different aspects of, technology.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>14:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But DJI was also very aggressive in their pricing. If I recall back in 2015, with the Solo, the one that had the GoPro camera and the gimbal, that was priced around 1, 700, while the Phantom 3 Professional package was sold at the same time about 1, 300, but then, a year later, DJI brought the price down to 900 and then slashed previous year's models to as low as 500. And so that pretty much put every other company in the West out of business. And, perhaps because they saw software as an advantage or because it was out of necessity, but Western companies pivoted to software. It was very difficult to compete with that. So, yeah, I agree. It was. It was a very, bleeding edge, innovative product and culture, but it could afford to have such price cuts. And so from that perspective, how did the strategy of their vertical integration play into their ability to outprice the competition. Perhaps this is a good transition to talk about their business model of vertical integration, as opposed to what we see currently in the West and compare and contrast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's an interesting observation and, for me, when I was, looking at that, my first thought was, okay, what the hell they were thinking 3d Robotics pricing their, product at a price point that was higher than DJI, you know, fiercest competitor to begin with. And then, DJI it even went lower than the original pricing. So that, that, that was the first thing that they struck me. But I think that, this vertical integration playbook really benefited DJI at first on the logistics level and on a pricing level where they could simply afford to go down with price because they didn't have a guy that was doing all of their manufacturing that had to make their money. They were the guy. So they could just make slightly less than that. This was a luxury that Western companies could not afford. But later, this system integration really enabled them to produce systems that are simply much more performant. So it was not just the pricing power and the logistics of it, speed to innovate or the ability to slash prices and still make money. It's also if you are not just doing your own manufacturing, but also rather than system integrating components that are produced by other parties, you are actually building all those technology blocks yourself from the chip out and then, otherwise, and then from within the chip itself in, in, in this latest stage, right, that I referred to earlier, you can start to unlock all these little pockets of efficiency that sit between the black boxes that you would otherwise connect, being a system integrator. And it boils down to, in order for these subsystems to be compatible, they need to talk over certain protocols, which are designed for interoperability, not necessarily for efficiency, and they're always a compromise. And then, when you have the luxury of owning the black boxes, the two black boxes you need to integrate, then you can open them and you can tweak them and you can optimize for whatever you're optimizing for and then unlock a tiny bit of efficiency here, tiny bit of efficiency there. And when you look at across the whole system, these little efficiencies compound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Give us some specific examples of where that manifests in drone performance, because as you describe this history, something that jumps at me is how is it that this performance advantage persists nearly 10 years later? If we look in the smartphone space, for instance, 10 years after the introduction of the iPhone, the hardware from competing smartphone manufacturers was all in the same league, right? They were all competing neck and neck. Whereas there's something about robotics or about drones or about this type of system that has enabled the first player and has enabled DJI to, not just have economies of scale, but to have what you're describing as a fundamental gap in performance versus what someone else could build using best of breed components that are available out in the rest of the market. You put those components together and you try and build a performant drone. It's going to fall short, and you're going to explain, hopefully, what that looks like today, and why that is, because I think that gets to the heart of the value of this integration, and it also gets to the heart of your first observation about the conventional wisdom that has been built up over the last few decades of how and why hardware commoditizes. Why is there a wrinkle in this space that challenges that conventional wisdom and leads you to a different conclusion? Let's get down to specifics and really unpack it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the parallel with, mobile phone, industry is a great one because both in, in small unmanned and smartphones, size matters, energy consumption matters and performance matters. And specifically thermals also matter, right? One of the, one of the interesting aspects where tighter integration can lead you to better outcomes than system integration, right. So I think it's a great, it's a great comparison and, In that world, in a mobile world, we have Apple versus others, just as we have DJI versus others in the small UAS world. And it just proves the point that, system integration will get you to a point but it will not bring you to the, the position of the number one player in terms of performance, right? And we're seeing the same thing play out in the smartphone world and in the UAS world. And I'm going to give you an example where this system integration, versus vertical integration really takes you to different levels, and that would be, low latency video as a sort of, specific use for a data link in a small UAS. In low latency video, and this is something that, that, we're very intimately, connected to because this is something that we've pursued and tried to compete with DJI in the FPV world, so we know that really well. In low latency video, there are certain quite different technology blocks that you need to integrate very tightly. And and in this case, system integration, like, it goes one level deeper. It's not system integrating a radio module and a video processing module. It's basically done on the chip level. So if you're not doing your own chips, you need to get a chip that's going to do your video processing, perhaps host to radio, then you need to get your chip, which basically is your baseband chip, right? And the problem with that, and it's that level of system integration. So it's like chip, not board level, but chip level system integration. And in this particular case, neither of those chips have been designed for this particular application. if you're really doing ultra low latency stuff, as we did in the FPV world, in the consumer FPV world, our, measure of latency was in milliseconds, single digit milliseconds. So, like, we need it to be below 30 milliseconds, glass to glass. When the photon hits the sensor to when the photon emits from the display on the other end, that needs to be 30 milliseconds or less.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>22:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Just for clarity, that's important for the human pilot flying the drone to have that sense of instantaneous transparency through to what's happening with the drone. That's where any sense of delay just disappears. Is that what you're\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>23:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, to go to, to frame that further, like, flying, consumer FPV, either racing or freestyle, human is very tightly, embedded in the control loop. The drone is not stabilized in any meaningful way. You are keeping it level by throttling it more or less. So, so you really need, with your eyes, you perceive the response, dynamic response of the airframe and you're providing the control input. It's pitch and roll or it's yaw or it's throttle, which is, arguably the most sensitive part for most of the new pilots, right? Throttle control. So, with low latency video, the lower that latency is, the more tightly you can be embedded as a pilot. You can be embedded into that control, right? This is why latency is important. And, it was funny because when we were thinking about latency, low latency in the rest of the world would be below thousand milliseconds. And there we were counting single milliseconds in order to, acquire frame from the sensor, put it into memory, read it from memory, encode it, compress it, packetize, you know, again, memory write, and then again, make it into a packet, send it off to a radio, and then radio needs to be transmitted, right? So, we're counting milliseconds and, all of these chips are really made for a user experience which operates in a sub second world, half a second here or there, Great example is, encoders, decoders. Like, we're talking about SOCs that have video encoders and decoders. They are made to consume or originate media in an embedded device. Not necessarily to be super fast and super efficient at encoding video and sending it at high frame rates and counting latency in, in milliseconds. So, if you have any latency, you're gonna buffer. And, that you've problem solved. Nobody's gonna, nobody's gonna, notice. So, first of all, like, if, when you start selecting those SOCs and you start asking questions to chip vendors, okay, how fast, yeah, we have a, encoder that's capable of doing, X. Okay, how fast does it compress a frame of certain, resolution? They don't know. They don't care. They don't have that metric, So this tells you that, we're trying to use a chip for an application that was not even like an afterthought to folks. And then on the radio level, on the radio SOC level, like, if you want to be, affordable for consumer space as we want it to be, you need to go commodity and commodity in this world means, Wi Fi SOCs, 802. 11 as a standard is not optimized for that kind of latency. It's optimized and it's designed for, interoperability and coexistence. We need to have a number of 802. 11 APs and station devices that, that, need to coexist in the same space. So they, they need to be able to negotiate how they access the spectrum, and not stamp on each other. That's not what resilient, low latency, radio for unmanned applications is. It's all about, consistently and robustly being able to transmit video packets without interruption to the ground station. And again, you're trying to make that radio chip do something that it has not been designed for and all that firmware that's not been designed for. So like, you're having to make compromises. Or go off standard if you can, which you can't because, the volumes that we're doing are so small that all these chip vendors are not paying attention. So, you end up making all these compromises, which then result in a performance that's suboptimal. Whereas, if you had the full control over the entire black box that is the chip and the hardware encoder, and the black box that is the radio, piece, the 802.11 chip, you would be able to, go into that black box, tweak what you need to tweak, make the two black boxes talk to each other seamlessly and efficiently, and without losing a step. And that's how you get the performance system. And which makes the difference between DJI's video link and everybody else's video link. They had the opportunity to, go into those black boxes and access to those black boxes. Whereas rest of the world had to deal with wiring the black boxes, whether the wires are literal wires or they're traces on a PCB, it ends up being the same thing, right? That's a great example of how, being able to integrate tightly outperforms system integration.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Especially in the absence of standards that emphasize the performance qualities that your market needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Now, how do you balance developing proprietary protocols that you need to optimize the overall system, how do you balance that with the need to interoperate in, call it the modern battlefield or in a commercial ecosystem?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's also, that's a great question. I think, the higher up you are in, the, you can draw parallels with the OSI layers, higher, how much higher are in, in those layers, it's easier to be interoperable and the lower you are to the bare metal, it's hard to be interoperable. And the reason I'm saying that is, you know, maybe you will want to do hardware that's, It's gonna be compatible with the Pixhawk universe, so your hardware needs to be somewhat interoperable, in order to be compatible with, with, Autopilot stack. But then again, you also want some proprietary stuff running there. so it's really, this is one of the challenges of building a hybrid, solutions that combine your proprietary stuff to, open source stuff, if that makes sense. So this is a very tough balancing act. And again, it leads to compromises, but the thing that's, that, suffers is that full compatibility.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So given the benefits of vertical integration how do you explain that, outside of a few companies like Orqa like Skydio, like Autel, I don't know, perhaps there's some others that you would like to mention, but how come that there are relatively few companies who are pursuing this vertically integrated model?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>29:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think first of all, vertical integration in the small UAS world is super hard, and this is because there are so many constraints, space, energy, swap in general. And there's a wide variety of different technology blocks, really, very disparate technology blocks that you need to, command in order to basically be in a position to system integrate, right? So, ranging from radio on one end of the spectrum to, I don't know, propulsion on the other. Completely different problem sets, but also interrelated in how they can affect each other in a very tight and confined space, which is a small universe. So, I think that like the threshold to, to actually be able to, start system integrating is pretty high in terms of like, simply starting from the number of different teams that you need to have in order to, to get started down that path. And I think, the type of talent that's required for certain technology blocks in this group, that they could be considered exotic, from the standpoint of like the current talent pool that the West is operating on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you have any observations more broadly on this market dynamics and how it is dividing into different segments where one segment is companies that are taking off the shelf components and putting them together for custom use cases, as we will in this discussion call them system integrators versus some that are vertically integrated, and then also, a handful of others that are also vertically integrated, but also very focused on a specific mission, like Manna like Wing for instance. How do you make sense of this segmentation of the market and the dynamics playing out in the future?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I do think that there's always going to be need for system integrators. If you think of the long tail of applications, a lot of these applications in the long tail are going to be much more efficiently and perhaps effectively served by specific system integrated solutions. And this is why I do believe in a long term persistence of component ecosystem, which will serve a diverse and innovative space of system integrators that will go after these, more or less exotic or like, all of these applications in the long tail. And I'm a firm believer in that. And, there's also, this angle of like the solutions that are addressing the head of the distribution, like, your Matrice or your Mavic, they're going to be great for 95 percent of applications or 90 percent of applications. And that, they're not going to be that great for the rest 10 percent of applications, right? So, there's also that aspect of how useful is your Swiss Army knife? So, in a way, this is like going back to semicon. This is why, all those chips that we end up having to use, are not that great for some, niche applications, like, low latency video, or radio, right? So, so, this is the same, this is the same type of dynamic. So I do think that there's going to be, a vibrant ecosystem of, system integrators that are going to be served by hopefully as vibrant ecosystem of component providers. there's going to be demands for interoperability. And, you know, to counter myself, this is going to be driving towards commoditization because you don't have to have this interoperability and, commoditization there I can accept happening. But if we talk about the head of the curve and really going after these most frequent, most, numerous applications, then in this space, we're going to have fierce competition in performance between the players that are able to vertically integrate, and not only to vertically integrate their supply chains, being able to compete on the economics, but also quickly integrate their R&amp; D, being able to dig deep into those black boxes, integrate them tighter, unlock those pockets of, efficiency that will compound into a higher performance over the competition. And in the small UAS world, that means flying longer. That means, safer mission. That means easier operation, all these things that kind of, make an overall user experience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>34:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Can you give a, perspective of near term market size for the component manufacturers, for the system integrator, for the service delivery company.

This low latency video comes from this niche consumer FPV space, which is where, the pressure cooker of consumer FPV where Orqa was born. But, outside of that, at the moment, like, your typical unmanned, remote operation scenario is not that, latency sensitive. Now, the lower the latency is the more dynamic remote operation scenario you can tackle. And, I think it's like one of those things where what's possible technologically, really defines what applications can be, but for the most, remotely operated or like, and even autonomy, right, Everybody's talking about autonomy, whether it's land based or aerial. In any massively fielded autonomous system, there's always going to be a percentage of edge cases where a human operator is going to need to intervene to get the bot out of the situation. Even in, in like, ideal world of autonomy, there's always going to have to be an option to remotely operate. Remote operation is integral part of the autonomy stack because you will need that. Even five percent of edge cases creates a necessity for hundreds of thousands of hours of remote operation. And then the latency of your video is going to allow you more and more dynamic situations, if that makes sense, right? But one thing I'm going to tell you what we were pitching back when we were kind of goggle company and low latency, you know, this was, you know, 90 percent of our stack, we were pitching this kind of remote reality as opposed to virtual reality, which is a technology enabling, an operator a immersive experience of remote real world setting, in a way that would enable the dynamic interaction scenario. So you, it would actually allow you to interact with remote environment. But I think that's still in, in an SF realm, in an SF domain. no,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, in autonomous systems, as most of us have been thinking about them, and the community has been working on them, you'll have video as a sensor, but a lot of processing of that data will be done right there behind the camera, and then only a very small amount of data is transmitted anywhere based on it. In this case, it's looking at, well, if you could transmit the full video, even over an RF link, even over a long distance, and you could do it at this type of sub 30 millisecond latency, what are the implications of that? What does that enable? Whether it's a human on the other end that is consuming the video, okay, that's remote operations, we know about that. Or whether it is machines that are consuming the full video on the other end, is that a frontier that we're looking at? Does that have implications for how you coordinate massive numbers of automated systems and enable them to coordinate very closely together? Is this an enabler to that, or is this a nice to have?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I, I think you're onto something there because like, especially for smaller autonomous systems, if you can displace that power hungry, and hot running compute from a small thing that flies perhaps, then, you would need a way to, to get that, sensory input at lowest possible latency. And, it's much cheaper to run a video compression workload or video pipeline then it is to run a autonomy processing pipeline on a tiny thing that needs to be autonomous. So, so, there's certainly, displacing the compute, displacing the brain kind of thing, which is also an added, benefit to, to like having low latency.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>39:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So there have been attempts in the past for Western drone companies to displace DJI, or at least, come close to it in terms of market share, but none really achieved any meaningful, interesting success in scale. Is now the right time? Is now any different? How do you see Western drone companies emerging as a credible threat to DJI?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It is. And I think that the rest of the ecosystem, rest of the world is actually getting a second chance. And I hate to say it, it's part of the unfair advantage that us as Western drone companies have, DJI does not have access anymore to increasingly large swaths of market and applications, and this is creating a vacuum in which, you know, Western companies that are lagging behind in terms of, the performance capability of their system, that they can, try to compete amongst each other in filling that vacuum. So I think,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You're saying because of the ban, because of the ban, that's why the market's being limited.

And then, the ban is creating a space where all of us, Western drone companies can have an opportunity to build something, to, because we, as a collective West, we lost, we lost the first half of the game, of the match in aerial robotics. fair and square, DJI won for better or worse, like, you'll have people saying, oh, yeah, they were subsidized. Yeah, well, probably, yes, they were subsidized extensively, but, we cannot hide from the fact that, they just did a marvelous job at engineering those solutions. And we have a chance to catch up, like collective West to catch up, leverage technology supremacy that we have in other fields, such as semicon. Collective West still has an edge in semiconductors over China. So, we are now getting a second chance to compete in aerial\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So if you were going to put together the dream team, what would you do to make sure the West catches up as soon as possible?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Oh, that's a great question.

I mean, this is, this is our, this is the premise that, that Orqa is building our future five, 10 years. We think that we can grow into a DJI of the West. But I'm a strong believer in DJI of the West having a strong presence both in United States and in Europe. And I believe that being able to serve those two markets, in, in full sense of the word, like being able to have customer intimacy, being able to have strong presence, and being able to, share identity. And then not, it's not just like, Orqa as European company opening offices in the States. It's also about being deeply embedded into the respective ecosystems. I do think that, strongly believe actually that, this is the way to build a DJI Out West. Have a very strong presence in both of these ecosystems on both sides of the Atlantic and, be able to, to really, serve customers on both sides of the Atlantic. And, when we talk about serving customers, there's going to have to be a, super tight integration especially if we talk about on the enterprise level, let alone defense, which is a story in and of itself, but even on the enterprise level, there's going to be, there's going to have to be a tight level of integration with all these aerial data collection devices and, how the data is being used and processed and decided upon, right. So, so, so, that requires, deep understanding of enterprises in their all specific shapes and forms on both sides of the Atlantic. Because, arguably there's a difference in how utilities operate in the States versus EU, for example, right? And then, you can look across all these other potential application areas. I'm not talking about how it's technically operating, but how they're organized, how they function and all these sorts of things. So I do think that this is like a strong advantage to a transatlantic player over any player that's going to be solely in US or solely in Europe, right? And learning from DJI Playbook, integration matters on the logistics point and pricing matters. And like, EU has done a tremendous job of reaching out to, more Eastern parts of the continent and integrating those economies and leveraging the beneficial costs environment. So, there's a good 10 to 15 years where this is going to be an advantage until we kind of level off. So there's going to be a substantial advantage of having a European, a specifically Central and Eastern European base, in being competitive on a cost level, both on R&amp;D side and the production side. So I think this is also an important factor.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Let's talk more specifically about the emergence of a credible DJI competitor. You mentioned a couple of catalysts. One being the, vacuum that's been created by the DJI ban that's been growing in, in scope and we'll see how that discussion ends, but we haven't talked about Ukraine, which is another great catalyst for the entire industrial base. In a world that looks much different than back in 2015 in terms of the maturation of the industry, the components, the supply chain, will the winning playbook be the DJI playbook, or will the maturation of the market and the technologies needed to put together a system like that, will that create an opening for another playbook?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think that, Ukraine and War in Ukraine is a massive, contributor to this, to this dynamic in unmanned, especially aerial system, small UAS and if you think about it, it's a perfect storm. On one hand, like you have these large swaths of market that are not accessible to DJI, primarily in the defense and security sector, primarily defense, and then later leaked out onto the law enforcements and security and critical infrastructure, et cetera. And then on top of that, you have this profound revolution in how defense thinks about UAS combined and, reinforced, right? So, so, before Ukrainian war, defense thought about UAS in terms of fixed wing systems, predominantly half a million, thereabout price point operated on a relatively high echelon of command. And what Ukraine is proving very graphically today is that the bulk of utility of unmanned actually comes from small UAS copters, multi copters, operated on the lowest echelon of command and deployed in massive numbers. And then, if you combine that, like massive need for small copters in the defense sector, and then, defense sector itself being sterile of DJI, like, this is like a complete no go zone, like, maybe there's a gray area in law enforcement, arguably, law enforcement agencies still could use DJI in Europe, but in defense, no way. Right. So the defense is like completely free of DJI competition for all of us other companies. So, these two dynamics are creating a perfect storm for a step up, massive step up in demand for the types of solutions that, would be provided by would-be DJI competitors and providing this initial momentum that will drive the, innovative cycle. So I think, even without the Ukrainian war, this dynamic and this kind of DJI West playbook became viable. The Ukrainian war just cranked it up to 11, really.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So fair to assume that a number of companies will come in and rush to get into and fill that vacuum. How do you expect the competitive dynamics to evolve on each of the segments? Let's look at, the consumer, the defense, the enterprise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:38\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So for consumer, I think, we have to look at different segments of consumer. There's like a, retail, consumer, market, which is, basically still, open for competition and DJI is untouchable there simply in terms of performance, the price, pricing power, it's the obvious choice for the consumer. Now, if we talk about educational segment of consumer type products, that's a different story because again, especially in US, this is also an area where Western companies have this unfair advantage that we can leverage in order to get business, be able to reinvest in R&amp; D and provide solutions that are going to be fully Western made. So, there's these two different sectors. And we as a company, we're looking at educational space where we can provide fully Western made solutions. And then we look at really some niches where we can compete on a purely technological and pricing basis. Now, enterprise is still, I believe, somewhat contested, although I've heard examples where, companies are really reluctant to go for DJI or Chinese solutions. So, this gives an unfair advantage to, to, Western companies. I think this is going to be contested, and it's going to be harder to compete with solutions that are not, as performant as DJI, however you want to measure performance. But I do think that, as opposed to consumer, you will still be able to sell a good enough solution. You know, you don't need to be better, you just need to be good enough to be able to sell. And there's like a large portions of that enterprise market where this is going to be the case. And then defense is, defense is purely like, it's going to be, and it's not going to be, it is right now the space where we're going to see most of, the business, happening for Western drone companies, in the small UAS or multicopter space, which is typically dominated by DJI. I'm not talking about Fixed Wing type platforms. We have a lot of great companies operating in that space across the board, talking about really small copters.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What are the major cost drivers for developing a small UAS system? What we hear is that for performance that is, somewhat approaching DJI's performance, you can get that from a Western drone OEM for three, four, five times the price, depending on, on, the specific use cases, et cetera. Can you generalize the major cost drivers and how certain catalytic forces like the Ukrainian war and the broadening of the industrial base, how that might impact those prices?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think volume is the dominant one. I don't think that prior to Ukraine, there was a conceivable scenario where a Western drone company would be in a position to sell a lot of copters to government users. Now with Ukraine happening, what we're seeing is a lot of, Western defense, end users are waking up to the fact that copters are going to be needed and copters are going to be needed in large volumes and copters are going to be used in an attritable manner. You deploy them and you're going to expect to lose them within three missions. So you better stock up on them. And not just that, you better invest in a capability, churn them out in large numbers, should you need them. Now this is a major contributor to, to really willingness to buy, willingness to invest in this capability, and like in the capability to, to develop these technologies, right, and support, Western companies and giving them business and contracts, et cetera. So I think volume is the main, you know, this understanding that, small UAS, small copters, that's, if you look at Ukraine, like this is all Mavic and Autels are the workhorses of the battlefield on both sides. And we as a collective West do not have a solution that's comparable to either.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You've been an early and leading player in the FPV segment, which now has emerged, or has grown from a very niche to volumes that dwarf any other segment. So can you talk about how you've experienced this evolution and kind of the trends that you're seeing and how you see the future?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's interesting because, before the war, we, had all these different strategies on how to popularize FPV because, you had to explain to people what FPV is. And for very unfortunate reasons, FPV has arguably become a household word now. And, you know, how that plays out, and I'm talking as a company that, that was started as a hobby company, consumer company, how that plays out and how FPV is perceived after the war, you know, it's anybody's guess. And I'm not entirely comfortable as FPV enthusiast, I'm not entirely comfortable with that situation. I don't know whether FPV is going to exist after the war, or, will we be able to fly FPV as civilians after the war. So I'm not entirely comfortable with that. But what Ukraine started is like, it showed how effective, consumer grade technology can be in a modern war. And that's the, I think the most impactful part of the whole dynamic that, that developed because, what's being used in Ukraine is essentially a hobby grade, technology that's incredibly accessible from the cost perspective, from the technological perspective, you need a bit of skills to build, and quite a lot of skill to operate, this type of vehicle, but nevertheless, super accessible. Like I cannot be expected to build a Javelin myself in my garage, but I can build an FPV in my garage. And with an FPV, I can probably hit a tank at a greater distance than I can with a Javelin. And I can bill it for like, what, 300, 500? And, Javelin is what, hundreds of thousands? So, this gives you an idea of how much disruption happened\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Can you just describe first person view? What is it? What's its value? What happens if somebody doesn't have an FPV capability for those who may not know as much about the market?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So FPV stands for First Person View. It's what we used to call our hobby prior to the war. FPV today stands for a first person view, manually controlled, quad captor. That is a radio controlled, a drone that's capable of carrying an explosive payload and it's operated fully manually, like as you would a race drone, by a skilled operator. And, this is basically, you can fly a drone for, a couple of kilometers and you can, strike an armored vehicle, which costs in millions with an asset that's, you know, the, some people call it an, like a flying IED that, that costs like hundreds of bucks, to build. And, we've seen a lot of companies coming up, in that space, being a component provider, we could see a lot of Western companies coming into that space, but in reality, Ukrainian war in particular, although that created a lot of interest in the West and that, created a lot of companies that are looking in that space, realistically, this again, was dominated by Chinese companies who were well placed, to serve both the needs of Ukraine and Russia in providing either components or build systems. And I think, if you look at, how various Western companies performed and Orqa included, trying to compete in that space, like again, we collectively couldn't compete with the Chinese on, on, on prices. And I don't think we should, because longterm, I think that FPV is specific to Ukraine and it's a phenomenon that's, indicative of absence of other means of strike by both sides, and, whether, strapping an explosive ordnance to a copter, whether that's going to be a optimal way to do precision strikes, that's anybody's guess. And my guess is, you know, probably there are more optimal ways to perform strikes, kinetic strikes. But what I'm certain of is that copters are the optimal way to provide battlefield transparency, the type of which we're seeing in Ukraine right now. And, as much as I don't think that the FPVs as a strike capability are going to stay here post Ukraine, I'm 100 percent certain that copters, which may or may not be FPV and arguably don't need to be FPV, will persist as a principle way to provide situational awareness and battlefield transparency, in the future. I'm not saying that the fixing platforms are going to be done, but I'm saying that, we're still going to have these fixing platforms operated on a higher echelons, but we're going to see much more copters being operated on a very low command levels. The challenge is going to be really collecting all of the data and then processing it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:35\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What have you observed in terms of how FPVs are being employed in Ukraine? How has it changed since early 2023 to today? What do you see coming in the future, and what is it about that that makes you think that FPVs are perhaps unique to the Ukraine conflict and that they're not going to continue to evolve in this way for future conflicts that they'll be supplanted by something else. I think that there are people out there with, the assumption that this evolution, what we're seeing in Ukraine is going to continue and that Western militaries across the spectrum are going to be rearming with, massive numbers of FPVs and incorporating these into their tactics as a lesson from the war. But if you have a different view on how that's going to look, walk us through that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Oh, yeah. I think, if, if you wanna have the nitty gritty realities of use of FPV in Ukraine, I strongly advise, listening to War on The Rocks, podcast and Russian Contingency where, Rob Lee and Mike Kaufman are really, delivering direct from the battlefield experience of FPV operators. And this is very detailed and highly informative in terms of tactics. So, what we're observing, is basically there's, some cat and mouse development in terms of electronic warfare countermeasures and being able to deploy these systems, freely, so there's a big change between, what was working at the early stages of war to what's working now. We're seeing a lot of, evolution in terms of how the electronic warfare measures are deployed and how the, systems are evolving to, be able to, operate in the presence of, electronic warfare. So there's that. These FPV systems are being, operated in an increasingly larger numbers. And basically both sides have been very successful in adopting those and evolving the tactics of their use. But ultimately I think, again, this is a specific for Ukraine because, simply because barring, drones, FPV drones and drones in general, and the anti air systems this is a very low tech war, ultimately. And, these FPV systems are being applied in a, a bolt on manner. And whether I'm seeing FPVs that are being used in Ukraine right now being used by, uh, in this form by Western NATO member countries, I would say no. Just starting from the fact that once you power up the drone, you're broadcasting unencrypted video feed to whoever cares to tune in. Like, just start from that. And, this goes from the fact that because of the latency, and because of the EW resiliency, you're compelled to operate an analog video system, and there's no efficient way to encrypt or scramble analog video system, just that, that leaves you with having to broadcast your mission, to whoever wants to tune in in the vicinity. So, so there's that. Also, like, I don't think that we should be falling into a trap of thinking that these are super efficient systems simply by looking at social media. And this is one thing that, that really, repeated by the people who had the chance to really observe how these systems are being employed. Like the efficiency numbers are super, super low. because. If we look on the social media, we're just seeing the strikes, but, then there's a massive, positive selection, happening there, right? So you will not see unsuccessful strikes being posted on Twitter and, you know, all the FPV pilots, from before the war, they know that, whenever you fly, you turn on the DVR because, if you lose a drone, that's how you find it by looking at the DVR footage. You can imagine that if every FPV mission is filmed and the operator has the footage, then you could even, say that we have seen every successful strike that happened, right? And we can be fairly certain that most of the successful strikes have been actually recorded. And in the world of social media and viral dynamics, this creates a powerful echo chamber where we all think that this FPV is this super efficient new asset, which, you know, we really have no grounds on making that conclusion because we don't know how many unsuccessful ones there have been for every successful one that we see. So, this second piece is efficiency. Third piece is, FPVs are really hard to operate. It takes a lot of skill, and this was one of the barriers to entry to the hobby before the war, which we were facing as a consumer company, like it's really hard to get people to remain and then to persist in the hobby long enough so they can enjoy it. Like, you really need to struggle before you get the skill and you can actually enjoy flying because it's not that easy. And I have hard time imagining, FPV being deployed in a big army sense. I can totally imagine it being deployed in a highly specialized manner. So, I can totally imagine FPV being a part of a special operator's toolkit, like that skill set, right? So, you train for a sufficient time, you become a great pilot. And then this gives you almost superpowers, right? And then arguably this can be a, a Special Ops thing rather than a big Army thing. Then again, simply the logistics of, deploying large number of FPVs is a stretch to be, you know, diplomatic. I mean, I'm going to give you an example. Whenever we would go out and fly for fun, there was always problems with frequencies and 5. 8 band, which is where you, where your video operates is very narrow. So you effectively have eight channels. And if you go out with a group of friends, like five or six of you, it's a logistic nightmare to make everybody stick to their own frequency. Right, so you always have this situation you're flying and somebody plugs in and they're on your frequency so all of a sudden you can't see anything. So trying to extrapolate that experience to a chaos of war where there's not only your side trying to deploy these missions en masse. There's adversaries trying to deploy these missions, like it's a nightmare. it adds to that thing about how efficient it really is, this question. So, compounding these five, different aspects of, like, reality of FPV I don't think it being used massively for strike. What I am, again, I'm going to say it, what I'm seeing this Ukrainian war changing in a way, how, army uses, copters is this situational awareness, mass deployed, highly attritable platforms for, defense applications. And, as an FPV company, we get a lot of, oh, FPV is the big in Ukraine. you guys, must be selling hundreds of thousands. And I'm like, no, the only ones making money in this FPV space in Ukraine are Chinese companies that, that perhaps they were making ready to fly drones in maybe single digit thousands per batch. I can totally imagine a lot of these companies doing tens of thousands per month, easy. And that led, funnily enough, that led to the commoditization. the price per system is like 500 bucks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:06:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Isn't there an argument though that technology will continue to innovate and try to close some of the gaps that you were talking about, whether this is better use of the RF spectrum, better, digital data links that are also resilient to EW, better logistics, better deployments, better ways for humans and machines to interface. Isn't that a valid argument that this arc of technology evolution will continue and make FPVs relevant in the future? Or if not, how do you see that arc continuing to evolve?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and I would add increasing automation of the flight control itself. All of those things, what would you want to see in terms of changes across that spectrum of technologies that would change your conclusions?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:15\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, I think, one of the gaps, certainly is, spectrum management. It's also EW resiliency for the high throughput data links, and video arguably is a high throughput data link. It's very hard to sustain sufficient data throughput over an RF data link for digital video. If you think that even 10 percent package loss of a compressed video is total, video loss. That's, super hard to sustain even in a congested RF environment, let alone contested RF environment. So, so, that, that's going to have to change in order for, these systems to be viable and a prerequisite for like, I think wider adoption, FPVs is going to have to be moving away from freely broadcasted analog video, which all of the FPVs you're using both in defense and in the hobby are being used, are using right now. I can totally see a benefit in adding automation and autonomy to these systems. It's gonna reduce the barrier to entry for skill required to operate. It would not have to be a matter of dexterity and ability to, to really, fly and, skill it's gonna, it's gonna be learned and it's gonna, you'll be able to learn more efficiently. But also, and I'm going back to this point of whether copters are the right strike vehicle. And that's always this thing that I'm coming back to. And I know that this trope of swarm of drones is a very attractive one, but have you ever seen how drone light shows are being deployed? It takes a stadium to set them up. So you're literally setting up an acre of drones almost in order to deploy a light show. So this trope of having swarms of drones attacking, like you would be, you, there, there's a lot of logistics that needs to go in, in deploying a large number of drones. And if one thing that we've learned about this war is that in a transparent battlefield, you need to reduce your logistic footprint, not, so, so in, in a way, we're going to have to, innovate, like collective we, we're going to have to innovate heavily in order to come up with a smaller footprint for deployment swarms, if we want to make swarms a thing. And then it brings me to the question, is copter really a great platform for strike? Or are there more, like, compact, efficient platforms to deploy strikes at that distance with that type of payload. And again, I have to go back to saying, expressing an opinion that, I think that both Ukraine and Russia are using FPVs as a matter of necessity and accessibility. It's more of an accessibility thing, because all you need is 500 bucks of Chinese components, some carbon, and explosives, to be able to affect a, precision strike beyond line of sight. And that's it. and, couple that with virality of the footage that, we established is recorded for every mission by default, because this is what you do as an FPV pilot, you DVR everything. Like, when you add that two things together, like, you get this impression that, oh, it's a massive thing, whereas, reality might be completely different. But what we are seeing is, a lot of Western forces are, working to, acquire these capabilities to, learn how to deploy them, learn how to use them, learn how to defend against them. And I think this is going to be here to stay, but I think that, this is a starting point and it will necessarily evolve and what's the end state, the, final form of it. Anybody's guess. And I'm really not. even, arguably being an insider and understanding, this, deeply because, we were doing it before it was cool. I wouldn't dare to venture where it lands, like, what's going to be the final shape of the strike vehicle, and I'm not sure it's going to be a copter. On the contrary, I'm kind of willing to place a bet that it's not going to be. Where I'm willing, again, 100 percent to place a bet is like for, low level ISR situational awareness, there's hardly a better thing than a copter.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:55\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Srdjan what's the message that you'd like the audience to take away from this discussion?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Srdjan:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:11:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, two messages, like, first of all, building small things that fly, it's super hard. And people should be aware that, although there is a massive, advantage of vertical integration versus system integration, we should not underestimate system integration because that in itself is also super hard to do right. So I think, ultimately if there's like one or two things, this would be that, this is hard, this is very hard.

It has some disadvantages, but I think staying too much time at the offices and drilling too deep into remote scenarios in your risk assessment, it sometimes gets not very effective, and I would suggest to put a limit on that and go out to the field and get your feet wet, in not the most favorable environments. And this is where I come to Israel. I invite companies, first of all, to come see what's going on here. We have been very open and we invite everyone to come and witness with their own eyes, not Zoom, not video calls. Coming, meeting the companies, being in our control center, and then come fly because you're gonna hit that problems at one point or another. So start that early. Sure, you're taking a bit more risk that your drone might have a malfunction. But if you do it over an uninhabited area, then come on, start flying. Let's put up a USSP first in a remote area. Combine a couple of companies. Experiment. That's my main message. And the second one is come do it in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>2:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Hey, welcome again to\"The Vertical Space\" and,a,one of a kind conversation with Libby Bahat Head of Aerial Infrastructure Department of the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority. This discussion has layers of value to include what makes Israeli aerospace unique, which includes that it's one of the more threatened airspaces in the world. We also discuss the Israel National Drone Initiative. A very impressive program, how it started, who started it, which may surprise you the program itself and the results to date. We discussed costs and profitability of drone operations, and how costs may be different in Israel versus other parts of the world. Listen to Libby's 1, 10, 100 and how it relates to profitability. It's amazing to hear about the use of drones and the management of the airspace in light up the current war in Israel. And how Israel managed the use of drones in the first minutes and hours of the war. Simply amazing. We spent a fair amount of time discussing the different impressive evaluations that have taken place. And what parts of advanced air mobility may be at scale today as a result. And what elements of advanced air mobility Libby sees scaling in the coming years. And what do you think he's most impressed with with advanced air mobility today? The answer may surprise you. I'll give you a clue. Listen to one of our more recent podcasts for the answer. So many thanks to Libby for his entertaining and important conversation. And to our listeners we hope you enjoy our talk with Libby Bahat as you profitably innovate and The Vertical Space. Libby has been working in the Israeli CAA for the past 15 years as the Head of Aerial Infrastructure Department. Libby is a qualified ATC, an instrument flight procedure designer, a Lawyer, and he holds an American private pilot license. Within the Israeli CAA from 2020 Libby is also in charge of the UTM/ U-Space implementation within Israel. Libby, welcome to the Vertical Space Podcast. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Thank you. Thank you so much. It's an honor being here.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:48\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What do very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>4:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I wouldn't know where to start. as we're following the European regulation. the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority, was in a good position to have a choice, to which regulation do we want to follow? Do we want to make one completely from scratch on our own? We're not a part of EASA. We're not a part of Europe, of the EU. Obviously, we're not under the jurisdiction of the FAA. So, we were in a unique position. And we looked at a couple of sets of regulations. Obviously, the European set and the American set, when again, we're looking at the ATM part of, of UAS, of, UTM, Unmanned Traffic Management. Eventually we chose, the European set, the EASA set of rule regulation 664 and it's, all, its, cousins, 665, 666 and so on. And as you recall, the basic, architecture is referring to a couple of U-Space service providers. So, a USPACE, let's say, over a city or over an urban airspace, and then the unit that will manage the traffic will be the USSP, UAS Service Provider, and a USPACE Service Provider, and it is supposed to give four basic services, ATM, conformance monitoring, geo awareness. Flight Authorization Services. So, even with that basic architecture, we had many debates.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm going to interrupt real briefly, if I may. Thank you for that introduction. But what's controversial behind what you just said? What does somebody not agree with you on based on how you've started this process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:36\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the basic infrastructure of four major services, just as a first example, we had questions, whether traffic management, the fourth service, you might say the fourth, obligatory service, mandatory service. We were not sure, we're still not sure, I'm not sure that's why I'm having a lot of debates about it in Israel, is better than having conformance monitoring, which is considered not a mandatory service. So we have questions about which are the correct, the better, you might say, four basic services. That's one thing I'm in discussions, let's say, a disagreement is a strong word. The second thing is having multiple USSPs in one UAS airspace. Again, there are many people, I'm one of them, that thinks this is so far ahead, and this is not the way that the average city will develop. So I'm not really sure that everyone is focused on, in these projects, in the our initiative and in many other projects, that there should be multiple, uSpace service provider in every uSpace. I'm not sure this is the architecture that we'll see at least in the the next couple of years, maybe 10 years from now, for sure, five years from now. So, so that's the second thing. I'm, you could say in disagreement. A third example we can talk about is, who will enjoy UTM? Will it be the average citizen? Will I get, like everyone expects, their coffee and sushi and hamburger and pizza? I don't think so. And I started many conventions with a picture of the soup Nazi from Seinfeld that says, No soup for you. Because I don't think, based on the current business case and looking at the cost, that the average citizen will receive a delivery by a drone in the next couple of years. I think it'll take longer than that. I think the public as a whole, municipalities, Police, different government offices. They will be the main users, of course, emergency services and health. So the third thing I might say is that, I don't think the average citizen will enjoy it, in the next year or two. Fourth thing I thought about mentioning is the conspicuity devices. So, how do we integrate crewed traffic into, the U-Space? Which technology would we use as a conspicuity device? Europe is very focused on ADS- low, ADS B, many different kinds of, new technology. And again, I'm in a lot of conversations with our colleagues about using things that are more common. I know about the Israeli, GA industry. Aircrafts are very old and, I don't see people installing new technology new devices in there. So I think people will use what's already in there. For example, Mode S, and then enhancing the capabilities of Mode S. or, and again, these are things that, that came up. Cellular devices. So, using our cellular phone as a tracking, as a conspicuity device. So, this is just a short of four topics that I'm, I have difficult with,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:11\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's terrific. I have to first say, usually pulling this answer out of people is not easy, but you gave us four things that people disagree with you on. Let me ask you on one of them. We had a terrific podcast last week, with, Bobby Healy from MANNA. I came away,a real believer of the initial value of the drone delivery being the high volume, now with MANNA, profitable coffee delivery is kind of a foundational start, to home delivery. You may not disagree with that. What you may be saying, I just want you to give a little more detail here. A little more light. Are you saying that the emergency services, the police services and all are taking the first priority for a reason, having nothing to do with economics or capability or delivery or profitability? You're just saying that for whatever reason, with your experiences, you feel the emergency services and the police will take priority.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>11:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I have to make, two different views on what we're talking about when we're talking UTM and USPACE. To have a segregated area and deliver, a cheap item from point A to point B, that's not what I'm interested in. I'm interested in managing large scale operations, multiple companies over urban areas, with a nice and good competition, and how do we manage the traffic, how do we maintain the skies safe. I don't call having a segregated area around a mall or around Starbucks and serving a couple of villages around it. I know that's profitable and that's being done and the costs are much lower. But when everybody's fantasizing about the pictures from the Fifth Element of taxis flying one over the other in Manhattan, And, through large scale operation over big cities and UTM U-Space, that's what, where I'm saying, this is not coming very short. And, the costs are high, are very high, be behind every flight. We'll talk about it soon. We made around 25,000 flights during this. Israeli National Drone Initiative. We'll talk about it. The costs are very high behind every flight, there is an ARA, an Airspace Risk Assessment. There is talking to multiple, government authorities. It takes a lot of time, a lot of people, there are people that are maintaining and, taking care of the computers in the USSP systems constantly because there are still bugs. So behind every flight, there are a lot of people and it's simply very expensive.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, it will be interesting if you could share some of the numbers on these cost drivers, because again, referencing Bobby's, recent episode, he was very open book about the costs being, currently,$4.27 per delivery, trending down towards,$3 by the end of the year. And they're not flying in segregated airspace. They're flying in controlled airspace. And you have multiple, delivery operators who are now flying in the same airspace under the Mode C veil in Dallas Fort Worth, for example, with MANNA and WING just recently showing how they are, coordinating their own internal UTM systems, or actually they're using an external partner. But that reality that you describe is really happening already. And with MANNA doing it profitably, don't you see that this is an early use case. Isn't that enough evidence?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">First of all, I'm a regulator, I'm CAA. I don't have deep knowledge, of the exact budgets that every stage is taking. Yes, the Dallas and the WING and MANNA cooperation, first of all, is something new. We all remember that we've been talking about UTM U Space at least for four years now. And only now, in the last couple of months, we see something, profitable. To my knowledge, they are the only one in the world that actually reached some sort of, of commercial profitability. I don't know of anywhere else it happened. I was at the Air Force for many years. And there are many ways you can count, one hour of flight of an F 15. Is it just the fuel and oil you replace? Is it the time the pilot was, instructed and qualified? Is it the maintenance that's after, I don't know, a hundred flights? So, don't know if they counted in the cost that it took to do the airspace risk assessment and the cost that people invested, the time that people invested in talking to, Dallas, to Dallas Airport, to, insurers to municipality, to the public, so I'm looking at everything to have one of our demonstrations. We still probably do have one demo, let's say every two months. So we're taking over a city, bringing there, let's say, 10 companies, now they're a bit less, but 10 operators to operate in the same city. And before such a week, we have 10 people, at least, just from the government, from the initiative management, working on it, I think, two full weeks. And, so I don't know if you measured just the electricity it costs to, charge the battery. and I'd love to hear, how it was done.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, you should check out the episode because, not to belabor the point, but, they do have a fully loaded figure that includes, variable cost and depreciation of the airplane, et cetera. But, what are those numbers like for the companies that you are working with in Israel? How much is their cost per flight?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>16:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I don't have exact numbers, Sometimes it's a simulated delivery. So the drone is flying from point A to B, but without the actual ice cream, hamburger, sushi, but$50 a flight. this, cause it's doing the actual flight and, we take over, an airspace over a city and we have, let's say, six, five locations spreaded in the city and drones are flying from point A to point B. They're being given, a destination that we're picking in advance. Which is, I don't know, two, three, five kilometers away from their departure point, going to that location and coming back. So this is what we've been doing. We have other missions that are not only deliveries, so we have cooperation with municipality, with the park So we did cooperation with the train, with the post office, with during COVID 19 pandemic. with the health administration. So, we had many profiles.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We're going to talk in a minute about your introduction to the Israeli, National Drone Initiative, but before we do, I'm sure there are people would like to know what's unique about the Israeli airspace? And then we're going to ask you about the INDI and, what it is, why it is, and the results you've seen so far.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">so, Israel is pretty small. Israel, if you Google the distances, so we're 470 kilometers long and 135 kilometers wide at the widest point. So, it's a very small country. I think, again, the square kilometers is around the 22, 000 square kilometers. However, we do have one of the largest air forces, at least in Europe, so either, even though Germany or France or the UK are 10 times larger than Israel, we have pretty much the same air force. You can, so you can imagine 600 aircraft squeezing in one aerospace. So it's small to begin with, we have a very large air force. It's very active. They're training a lot. Every pilot, in the Air Force does at least one flight a day, sometimes two. So the airspace is constantly, occupied. So these are first two things. Of course, we do have a very active, general aviation community and helicopters and light sport aviation, gliders, balloons, UAVs. We'll talk about that, in more in a second. So it's a very congested airspace. other thing is even before the war, it was a pretty threatened airspace. Everyone is very much on alert constantly for hostile drones. You can, see now that we're dealing with tens of drones a day, right now during the war. But even before that, we saw at least one attempt per month, even at what you call so called peace time. So everyone, is really on high alert from hostile drones. Theoretically, I know every country says they are on very high alert from hostile drones, but I think again, the volume here is obviously, much higher, I think we have many authorities with actual capabilities to deal with a hostile drone. And you have to make sure there will not be misidentification between a hostile drone and a friendly drone. So again, that's a bit different, because I think in many other countries, not every policeman, but not every senior cop has the ability to actually take down a drone. And in Israel, it's much more common. So, so the actual ability to deal with the drones is different. The last thing that most of Israeli airspace of that small airspace is not civilian, is not controlled by civilian unit. Most of the airspace is controlled by a military unit. The airspace are shared. So air aircraft, civilian aircraft can use military airspace, but the units that are controlling, are Air Force units. And, I'm a controller at Reserve Service at one of those units. Uh, and this is something unique, but we learned to use this sometimes as an advantage. So to make a lemonade out, out of this lemon, there are things that, civilian ATC, are pretty reluctant to do. and that's different with military ATC. So we take the advantage of each situation. So, so that's what's unique about the Israeli air space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So tell us a little bit about the, INDI background, use cases, participants, results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, around four years ago at the beginning of 2020, we were approached by, to our surprise, our highway authority. So, Ayalon, Highway Company, it's the equivalent of the highway authority and by, the innovation, authority they approached us, and we very soon, we set up a meeting with our director general. And basically, what they said, listen, us, the highway authority, have a mission to make the roads as clear as possible, to make the traffic flow. And we want to look at the possibility of removing small trucks and, scooters and making the roads a bit clearer and safer. Our innovation authority said we have the budgets, it's innovation, it's high tech. We have a budget. We want to start with a big initiative. We want to experiment, we want to try, we want to get our feet wet. Have companies fly over urban areas, let's say Tel Aviv and we will learn from this experience. You, the regulator will learn, which are the laws that, that you should do, which regulations you should change. Everyone would benefit. And to everyone's surprise, you can say, our Director General gave the thumbs up, and says, I'm good with that, Ayalon Highway Authority. You may take the lead. You have my green light. You have my people. That's me and my colleagues, Ami and Liron. Please help them with whatever they need. So this is how it started. And the basic structure says that us, the three authorities set up a tender. And we say in a one month, there will be a USpace and a UAS airspace over Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, just name a city in Israel, we've done it in that city. So there's going to be an airspace that we're going to experiment with deliveries. So, let's say for the first demonstrations for the first two years, about 10 operators, 10 drone companies, applied. Every company was checked and double checked by the innovation authority to see it's a valid, good company. And, you should fly every day, 50 missions, 50 flights will give you on every morning where you have to fly to, and everyone has to be connected, obviously, with the control center. So one of the, the bullets of that tender was also applying for, uh, USSPs, companies that will run the aerospace. And, we have two companies in Israel that joined right from the start, Airwayz and High Lander there. And they remained until now. We didn't have a third company joining so far. And this is how the structure was built and after a month, and that continued for 25 times, a headquarter or a control center is being built in that city. Airways and Highlander are two USSP companies sit together, connect their computers, set up the DSS, we'll talk about it. The companies equipped their drones with remote ID and we start flying. This is the basic structure. Besides those dedicated demos, I think the European term I like using is VLD, Very Large Scale Demonstration. So other than those something VLDs, we also used some opportunities we had outside of these organized demos. So when COVID 19 meant a complete lockdown of movement, actually, in Israel, curfews and so on, though we offered our services to different hospitals and the Ministry of Health to deliver, covid, samples, and to deliver, something to a building that's isolated. But we can land our drone on top of the, on the roof of that building in that hospital, drop the supplies that the nurse required, and that would save a nurse to dress up, dress down. It takes about 15 minutes. So that's one, way we did during the COVID-19, when there was a security situation in Beersheba. And we needed to scan the roads, help assisting the police to track down a suspect. We used to have a crisis in construction site with people falling down because they didn't, harness themselves correctly or they're doing their duties with no helmet. So we had a ad hoc cooperation, to see the, we can, control the safety in those sites. So, I can name a couple of other, corporations, but, the basic structure is the VLD and then jumping on different, opportunities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So Libby, I'm curious to understand a little bit more one of the first things that you mentioned, where your views, diverge from the rest of the industry, flight management versus conformance monitoring. Do you mind exploring that, thesis a little bit in more detail, including, arguments in favor of each.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>26:01\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, the four services that are mandatory according to, the European regulation, are four, they are network id, geo awareness, flight authorization. And the last one is traffic information. And this is, something that we dealt with, during the beginning of the war. I'm taking you to October 8th, okay? Or let's say October, 7th, noon, when everyone knows Israel is under attack. And we know that the war started with drones being sent from Gaza towards Israel, and there was a very big fear that, hostile drones are still, within Israeli airspace. Very soon, we pushed the 9/11 button. Everyone on the ground now, after a couple of, minutes, all the villages and all the, security managers of cities, of remote villages, of settlements, called us and say, listen, we have to fly our drones because this is the way we take care of the perimeter. We patrol the fence. So, you have to withdraw this restriction. So we have, and again, it's not only a fear from drones, it's a fear from terrorists that penetrated Israel. Eventually, what happened, and I'm cutting a long story short, we can get to that later if you wish, is that we declared the entire Israeli FIR as a demo or a semi U-space. That every settlement was allowed to fly in its own territory, only if they're connected to the USSP. Very fast, we, we built the control center. Have Airwayz and Highlander, our two USSPs, sit together, and we gave the possibility for each settlement to connect to either one of them, just as, theoretically you would, the European regulations sees that could happen eventually in a city. And it became clear to us that we are giving, actually four services, but not the ones that the regulation is referring to. So we're giving a network ID, obviously, no one was allowed to take off without, a network ID. The companies were giving these, operators geo awareness service. Before they would fly, they would file a flight authorization request. But, there was no need to, for traffic information service. There was a need, however, because everyone was flying within his own settlement. And many of these flights was anyway VLOS, because these were the guards having their drones within line of sight, doing their line in their territory. It doesn't have to be the full settlement, but their part that they were responsible in that fence. But it was very important to have a conformance monitoring because we wanted to make sure that if these were, on the border of being amateurs, these were not professionals, again, guards and volunteers for every settlement, for every village, including from my kibbutz where I live. Volunteer told the management here, listen, we have a drone we have good camera capability. I can guard this part of the fence from 2:00 AM to 4:00 AM So many people volunteered and we wanted, it was very important for us to give them some sort of an alarm if they're doing something you're not supposed to do.. If they're getting away from the area that they are, they're allowed to operate. So conformance monitoring was very important. Traffic information was not so important. Now, when I try again to learn from this experience, and this is, getting close to what I was talking to in the first part of where people disagree with me, I think the average development of a shopping mall with one company serving the villages around him will happen much faster than 10 operators over Tel Aviv, a couple of, USSPs will give their traffic services. I don't think we'll reach that amount of traffic that will, it will make it profitable for everyone. I think we'll start in many places with one company giving services to the areas around it. And the services that are important are the ones I mentioned. The traffic information service is for a later stage. Even that, again, I'm in a couple of teams in Eurocontrol, in EASA. Including the ones, Andrew is so active at, and the way that traffic information service will be giving is questionable. Theoretically, the operator should get an information about a drone that is approaching him that is, not monitored or, a man crewed vehicle or, under the the, dynamic crewed, traffic. He's supposed to, take care of that. He's supposed to land, move his drone. There are many questions on how it'll be actually implemented and, I think it's a very good. philosophical or not discussion, but this is some part I'm, first of all, I'm imagining the development, the chronological development, as a certain direction. I might have it all wrong, but assuming this is the way evolution will go, I think the weight on each services will get clearer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>31:50\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's an interesting observation. And one thing that comes to mind is, if you're suggesting that there will be one operator per region serving a certain amount of airspace and the people underneath them, it becomes very difficult to then, arbitrate who will be that one provider in that area, right? Obviously as a government, you cannot say, no, we already have one operator in this area, so nobody else can come close in a way you're then promoting a monopoly in that particular area. So I don't think that's the way to go either. So at some point, the market forces will drive operators into a certain area. And now the problem is, okay, let's say that we have more than one, does that create the need for traffic information service.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>32:33\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. Definitely. I wish, and I truly hope that I'm wrong and that I would get a request from four companies or even two to start deliveries in Tel Aviv. And then I would say, okay, guys, how do you, manage the separation? So I really hope I'm wrong, but until that situation comes, I think we will see more and more situation when we have, deliveries by one company because no one else wants, you're very right. I truly wish that I will get a request just as we start with multiple operators to operate in a certain airspace. However, since I know the costs right now, at least in Israel, are very expensive and the service will be very expensive, I'm not sure it will happen. I was starting to say that I'm looking at many problems in my life, in aviation, let's say, from history. And I'm looking about, how expensive services and new technology started. And I'm looking at the helicopter, taxi services in New York. And when I was a kid, I looked at the helicopter and my dad told me, oh, this is so expensive. When you're old, it'll be cheap. It'll be a 10 helicopter. It didn't happen. so I hope this will happen much faster, but for now on, since this services are expensive, I don't see a very large market and so many customers, so I hope I'm wrong, but that's why I think we won't start off right from the beginning with multiple operators because of these costs. When the first company arrives, starts delivery, as soon as the second company arrives, that'll be a good point to tell, okay, and, and we can set that off from the first contract with the first company. Okay, guys, you knew this is gonna come. I told you that when another operator comes, you will have to find a solution for safety, and you will have to have someone to manage the airspace. Guess what? As the Europeans like to say it, an acceptable means of compliance would be a USSP. By the way, do we need at that point two USSPs? Maybe we need just one company to manage the airspace. So I'm talking about scalability and costs. I have a good fault in that we've been working very hard in Israel on how to, and I'm going to get to that right with that question. What are the bottlenecks? So we've been working extremely hard in Israel on making this work. So making two USSPs cooperate perfectly, having no bugs, having restricted areas going back and forth. Having the flight authorizations, whatever is needed, and, it is very hard. And now, or let's say, as I, you could say, grew up a little bit and learned the costs, I'm thinking we might have made a mistake and we might have focused not on the most important and urgent thing. We've been focusing very hard on making a couple of USSPs work together perfectly in a U-Space. And what I'm telling you now, how sometimes I view things, it doesn't correlate with that knowledge now. But I was the first one to promote working on cooperation between a couple of USSPs. And that brings me to a question. Having two USSPs, or three, or fifty, working together is extremely hard. It's extremely hard because of emotions that competitors have, and, you can, assume a perfect utopic world, but we're talking about people. And when two companies have to work together the atmosphere has to be good. And when it's bad, and he's not working according to criteria, no, that guy's not working according to criteria. And unlike other topics that I'm in charge of in the CAA, I'm not a coding expert, and I don't know all the algorithms on the ATSM by heart. And, so, so that is a major, bottleneck, having two companies cooperate, so that's one stage. And then there's the actual technical difficulties. There are hundreds of commands and hundreds of orders and code is switching from one place to another. And hundreds of questions arise. And to some of them, I would say even many of them, there is no one answer. And, we had to answer many questions. And, this was the second and third, bottlenecks. The actual technical difficulties of running such a complicated mission. And the third one is the criteria that is not yet existing. So these are three, bottlenecks, I would state that these are going to be a big headache for me when we start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:34\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so is it fair to say that most of the challenges are, a step beyond simply assembling the information of the traffic picture across the different operators, but the challenges are really in using that information, how to coordinate the flight operations and keep them deconflicted when you're dealing with competing operators. Is that what you're saying?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think so, and this is just looking internally. So having two companies cooperate. Having, two companies, both software, you could say, working, that's the, second issue. Answering questions that are not, or getting answers that are not in criteria, that'll be the third. and we haven't even started talking about, different issues that are coming from outside. So, police, so Air Force, and many other government authorities want to have a say and want to make you do something for their needs. So, just looking at the internal difficulties, these are the major problems I stated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The National Drone Initiative has been ongoing for a few years now. What are some of the biggest insights that came out of it? And I'm curious, how come after so many years, there is no regular commercial operations of drones.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:56\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">On a private or commercial area for one single company, we have a lot of drone activity. Drones have been flying in Israel for more than 50 years. I was working on the first AIP chapter that incorporated them into the Israeli airspace 15 years ago. The first AIP chapter, on routes corridors and training zones was published in Israeli AIP in 2010. So we have around 300 companies registered, 300 operators, and around I think 3,500 drones have a registration number, meaning they're doing commercial activity. It sounds, doesn't sound like a lot, but if you look at Israeli size, that we are only less than 10 million people. If you look at the scale, it's pretty okay. So a lot of companies are having very successful commercial activity in the drone industry. So we're looking at agriculture and we're looking at photography and different IR scans and security. You name it. I think Israel is pretty known for being rather advanced. And there are many, companies that are working very successfully. We think generally, we're looking at, uh, a formula that says 1, 10, 100. So one operator operating 10 drones doing 100 missions a day. We generally say, as a very generalized, formula, when we were at that point, then we can be profitable. If we have one guy operating one drone, again, we might have get, got the math wrong, but we don't think this is, profitable again for the average citizen. So that's why the main, areas that it is worthwhile is the areas that, that I mentioned that are for public. I don't like, you can say the police example, cause, cause that's a wholly, a totally different, ballgame. That's first responders, that's emergency, let's say getting a defibrillator, serum, and they have, again, looking at manned, crewed traffic, this has been like this for ages and there will be no difference in drones, if a police helicopter used to have priority, then the police drone will have priority, and the same goes for medical operations.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:26\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Do you see the same concept of separation minimums of the traffic for drones that we already have with helicopters and other aircraft operating in the airspace? Will they be kept apart by the same distance? Do you see it as being something different for drones and, what is the capacity of the airspace for these different drones to operate alongside each other based on that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>41:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we started off, with a very basic, number, you could say, before the initiative, the basic number for, BVLOS separations was a separation of, five miles from IFR flight 2000 feet. And from, in Israel we have what we call controlled VFR route, or in short term CVFR, controlled VFR, and from VFR routes we allowed five kilometers but still, 2000 feet. That's, with the very basic certification process and before, dedicated the risk assessment. So, this is how we started the initiative after, when we started with the first demos we knew each company went a very detailed certification process and testing of their specific drones. So after we did that process, then the basic separation, got down to 500 feet. And, it was still, five kilometers, but 500 feet, vertical separation from, VFR traffic and man, the crewed, VFR traffic. And this was, fair enough for the, these, demos by the way, between the drones themselves within a U-Space we experimented with 60 meters between one drone and another. The initial altitude for the, U-Space was, 400 feet. That was the initial, number and that's around 120 meters, so we thought, again, looking at the traffic volume, we actually need to have two drones passing at the same second one over the other. So we experiment a little bit with, two actual, levels. So one drone flying at 60 meters, the, the other at 120 meter, again, very soon we realize it's working. We have to work a lot and very hard and the cost of having one drone do 360 or hold for 15 seconds and letting the other one pass, it's just so much simpler, and the traffic volume doesn't really justify getting into all that very hard work. I do see a very, big difference from manned traffic and that eventually every drone, the USSP, that unit would know its specific characteristics. So if I know that the regulator authorized for Matrice 300 for a specific type of drone, that we know that it was proven to us the accuracy levels are 60 meters by 60 meters, and another drone is less accurate. The other drone is cheaper, and that's, we could prove, or someone could have proved to us, that drone's accuracy level is 100 by 100, then the USSP systems would be able to tailor a separation for each drone. And it's a very big issue if I was a controller and I would known 737 800s have this level of accuracy, Airbus 320 have that level of accuracy and so on and so forth. But when a computer is running the thing, then I have no big issue of having a tailor separation between each two sets of drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And if you get down to, 60 meters by 60 meters type of separation, even in work you're doing today, and that still strikes me as a high number, but even if you stay there versus what you might achieve in the coming years, to me that seems like that would minimize the impact on the other drones that are operating in the airspace is type of separation would leave a lot of capacity, in the airspace system for drones. Is that the right read, on this or do you see it a different way?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>45:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I see it, the same way exactly. I was at a webinar or, it was even, a, of a conference that I think the Spanish authorities, I believe, were investigating a much lower number. Just as you said, I don't think it's a realistic, number. the second issue I was coming to is the reference altitude. The how do we, make sure that the drone that took off from one place but lands on the other has the same reference altitude as a third drone that took off from a totally different place? And that's another thing that you could say is you, it's not only unique to Israel now, but GSS interferences. So GSS interferences are a big thing in Israel. I know not only in Israel, now entire Central Eastern Europe and many other areas. Unfortunately, conflicts are not only in Israel right now. When you take everything into account, I think 60 meters as just, as you said, is it, is an ambitious number to begin with, I'm not sure how quickly it will be absolutely necessary, and I if I have a better solution of separating traffic, if it means one drone will, slow down for 30 seconds, I prefer the easy and simple solution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As I understand the operations that you have trialed so far are mostly VLOS, correct?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:06\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, I would say, something between, a third or even a half were BVLOS.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What's involved in obtaining approvals to fly BVLOS?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I'm not in the, airworthiness department, so I'll have to have a assistant from my colleague, Ami, from, airworthiness and engineering. But again, it's not something, new, of course, beyond visual line of sight operations have been in Israel for many years. And it's not something new. I could say just one thing without getting into the technical specification of what it takes to take a BVLOS. First of all, it doesn't require detect and avoid. So, drones that were manufactured, Hermes 450, for example, they're manufactured in a factory next to, uh, which is in the north part of Israel. And then those, had to fly to test their engines to instruct a foreign, customer, their BVLOS. obviously, they're flying, in an unsegregated airspace with other traffic, but without detect and avoid. The second thing is that we required a very well trained operator that's very well, knowledgeable in IFR flights, in, different malfunctions, obviously communication problem, navigation problem, just almost as an IFR pilot. And I know we were approached many times being told, Hey guys, what's needed to fly a Hermes 450 from the north of Israel to the south part of Israel is different than what it takes to fly a Matrice 300 or an Autel, over the margins of Tel Aviv over a large central park. So, these are a couple of requirements.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>48:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, so IFR expertise is not really a factor if you want to fly a small UAS up and down the coast beyond visual line of sight. So, is the Israeli Civil Aviation Authority using a SORA like framework to try to assess air risk and ground risk and then based on that assigns a SAIL level and later approvals for operators. Would you describe that process as very much similar to a European process?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>49:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, it does. Again, not in my department, it's Aerial Infrastructure Engineering. I get to the part of that assessment that involves the aerial infrastructure. Again, this has been going on, for more than 10 years in Israel, you might even say, 50 years in Israel, and I get, into the picture when we're looking at the aerial infrastructure. Do we get next to an ILS and next to a SID from Ben Gurion? From a VFR route, what we call the controlled VFR training zone, and so on and so forth. But generally, yes, we didn't invent anything new. We're following a European regulation. I think we have some combination with the FAA regulation. I know for sure with licensing, we're following part 107. And I think historically the Civil Aviation Authority was very well connected 15 years ago, much more to FAA regulations. And we have a couple of relics from that period, like licensing, but, we're following either European or FAA regulation very strictly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I see. And I'm curious about your comment about not requiring detect and avoid for some of these larger UAS BVLOS flights. Is that because the entire airspace is so very tightly controlled that, there's less emphasis on detect and avoid.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes, that's because all the airspace is controlled by a military controllers that have, very good sometimes too, strict control on every vehicle, on every aircraft. That's why we don't rely on the eyes of, of the operator. We don't need the eyes of an operator on the vehicle itself. They do not share the airspace with VFR. So in VFR traffic, theoretically, there is no such thing as separation and as instructions of ATC, but we rely on visual flight rules. So I won't get a drone in those routes. I usually I rely on both pilots. Either one of them will have to see the other traffic. Even if one is delayed, the other one will catch it first.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So general aviation VFR flights can only happen in certain corridors in Israel?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">When it's a bit complicated, if it's unplanned and you just want to hop on your Cessna and take off, to train a little bit, then you can do it, yes, only on certain corridors and on certain training areas, normally close to the, the airports on weekdays. Weekends, it's a bit different. There's much more freedom for the civilian low aviation to go about, wherever they want. And even during weekdays, they always have the possibility to request a special, request. they ask these, they file these requests and hundreds a day, to do this or that activity. Sometimes it's authorized, sometimes it's not. Mainly because. the airspace is packed with the Air Force training or doing operational missions. So, it's kind of a special situation in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:27\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just out of curiosity, at what altitude does controlled airspace start?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>52:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">It's basically you could say from zero to 5, 000 feet, but looking at very basically, there are some sections it'll go to 10, 000 feet and some that'll go below 500 feet. And even, it's a topic for another podcast. Even the way the controllers are controlling VFR traffic is almost close to IFR. They are giving them very strict instructions and separation, and they are very worried if two Cessnas come in a converging junction. But 5, 000 feet is a fairly good number.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So considering all of these factors, airspace and otherwise, is Israel an attractive region for drone operators from other countries to come in and do business? How often does that happen?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>53:25\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, we started the initiative, and I think we got a little bit famous around the world just a couple of years ago, let's say three to two years ago. And a year ago, nine months ago, the war started, just as before the initiative, getting a operator to fly in a country and not his own there's a paperwork involved. If I were to come with an Israeli company and start doing business in the U. S., It's not so simple. I think that again, Israel is a very attractive, or let's say should be a very attractive place for foreign companies to come because we took all these lemons and made them into a lemonade. So the fact that most areas are not controlled by civilian ATC means that we have, to do the coordinations with the Air Force and they apply very good logic, they are not obliged to look at some of the separation laws that the conventional, the historical, separation laws that came from a certain history in a certain context that is not relevant today. So we can execute to some extent logics that we cannot, demonstrate with civilian ATC units, unions, you name it. Now, the second thing is that again, I think we, the Civil Aviation Authority, have demonstrated that we are pretty flexible and that we are very helpful, that we are very approachable. You don't have to take my word for it. You can ask people from the industry, but me, Ami from Airworthiness, Liron that works with me, the SWAT team that was established to take care of UTM U-space. We are really doing our best, and sometimes an operator, it's very important for them. They might give up some profits, they might look at different problems they have getting a responsive and active regulator is a very big bonus. Now, the last thing is that I think, like the famous song, if you made it in Manhattan, you can make it anywhere. Well, if you've flown in Israel, no one can tell you that, you can't cooperate with authorities. No one will tell you that you cannot fly in places that have a hostile drone threat. And no one can tell you, ah, you, you probably can't fly in congested airspace.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I like your analogy. If you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere, right? But you're not at scale, though. So even though people are operating in Israel, and you can say, well, if you could do it here, you could do it anywhere. But nothing's really at scale. Or am I missing something?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think, having, around 25, 000 flights, let's say half or third of them in BVLOS in four years, in 25 very large scale demonstrations over people, over, the most major cities in Israel, over Jerusalem, the most sensitive place on Earth. With the size of the Israeli airspace, I'd say we're at scale. I didn't hear of any other country that ran a demo or a project with 25, 000 flights. It's true that the market. in Israel has its limitations. We're 10 million people. Let's say the more, more attractive parts of Israel with the major, customers, that is the big cities, the major urban, areas. Let's say our half of it, so we're looking at 5, 4, 3 million people. And that's true. The market is not very large. I think we have our advantages. someone can grab the opportunity and if our advantages are exactly fit that this or that company that can make good use of it I think they will be very unique So again, I think our attractiveness is true. It's not size and the market, but it's the other considerations of, and other special factors in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, on a few different, dimensions, you've mentioned the impact of military drone operations in the airspace and how that shapes the scale up of commercial operations. Looking at what you've seen in the Israeli airspace relative to this, and then also what we're seeing from the growing use of drone operations in wars like Ukraine. And if we project ahead to the future, what do you see as the implications of all of that?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We had, this question being slapped on our face on October 7th, and we had to answer it right away. So we had about 24 hours to understand that we are in a highly threatened, new state of Israel, a new situation, yet we also knew in order to save lives, we have to allow friendly drones to fly. So that question was thrown in our face pretty aggressively on October, 7th. And right away. By the way, it went, we made an emergency regulation. We went to the parliament. Our two, units, our two USSPs were licensed according to Israeli law. So it wasn't, something that, that went on, without thinking it went through the entire, legal process in Israel. And basically what we did right away is mandate a remote ID to every small drone that's taking off. We mandated, that either company, that the entire Israeli airspace would be covered by companies that knew that's their responsibility and that they would pick up any RID Signal that that shoots up in that airspace. By the way, we contacted very fast DJI to open up their, RID broadcast services and they did it pretty fast. They understood the situation. So basically every drone that people are buying right now is transmitting, broadcast, RID right now. So, so these are a couple of, the solutions we found right away. I can say, from my experience, also in my, as, as my, with my reserve hat on, even the way that the Israel has dealt with the drone issues, even within Israel is very different. You hear about a couple of drones a week entering the northern part of Israel But although there have been a hundreds and hundreds of attempts from Yemen and from Iraq to send drone to the south part of Israel, no one succeeded. I don't want to get too much military here but even within israel, there are parts that the solutions that were there work much better. And obviously there are places where the solutions are much harder. There's no one solution. And we will have to build on many small solutions and try to make an impact.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Libby, you've gone through many successful years with the INDI. You've learned a lot. Three years from now, you have a couple of parts of the advanced air mobility structure at scale. What's going to be at scale and why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:00:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I, I'm in a bit of a disagreement with my colleagues, as you heard. I wish that I would have, in three years from now, At least two USSPs in all the cities of Israel. I hope the bigger ones, obviously more customers, more people will enjoy more to the public, all these USSPs will be coordinated with the different defense organizations in Israel. So the Air Force, the police, other security organizations will have that. Picture so every police officer could have two swipes on his iPad and see if the drone above his head in the middle of Tel Aviv is a friendly one or he should take it down. and that goes, to the unit, to the Air Force unit. I know we're focusing for very good reason on urban airspaces and how do we provide the services in urban airspaces, but I want cities to be connected. We've been having a lot of flights between U-Spaces, long distances. Vehicles with the eVTOL, you just have to have a wing and it's, and you can call it eVTOL, another multirotor. So, larger vehicles. We've had, the EHang vehicle, both the 216 the passenger version and the cargo version flying in Israel. So I would want to have, some sort of taxi service. It won't be cheap. that's what I think, But I'd want that to happen.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:29\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But that's unlikely to be at scale in a couple of years. Clearly what you're describing with the drones, for the police forces, for the security forces, that it's seamless, that probably will be at scale is what we're hearing. And I'm guessing there will be some kind of drone delivery services, whether it be for, coffee, hamburgers, or medical delivery. It sounds like that may be at scale based on the excellent lessons learned. My guess is a little bit from what I'm hearing, passenger carrying vehicles, probably not at high volume scale, right? In three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:02:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I absolutely agree. We have, stations outside the city, you can park your car and take a bus. So if I can for 10 kilometers, even less so, if, if I can have a, EHang for$100 a flight doing this, seven minute flight the next central station in that city, I'd be very happy. Just as you said, I think the operations that will be of scale are those that have some sort of public value. So, I think municipalities will be a good place. Heavily using drones. I think government offices, environmental, looking for, construction garbage that, that, truck drivers throwing their, the dump from their trucks at illegal places. So I think, a general public, usage will be, at scale. I know we've been in contact with many offices and municipalities, court authorities, of course, the health industry. So I think in three years from now for that, I can, I'm pretty positive, unlike what I said at the beginning, that there will be a very long time before I'll get my sushi with a drone. I think it's different with public use, and that I can bet.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I do want you to give two minutes to the USSP providers out there. Let's say governments who are going to be deploying the USSP's and service providers, commercial organizations that are part of this process. What advice would you give to people? It's not, you have a lot of practical experience with really complex airspaces. What advice would you give to countries or providers for USSPs?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The first advice is having a very good knowledge in aviation and in regulation. We had high tech companies, very smart people, but without previous knowledge in aviation, they're having a very hard time understanding the logic. Look, I have a perfect solution. Yes, it's not STM, mine is better. No, you don't get the picture of the way things work. So, so this is, one advice. The second, that's more for countries and organizations. Don't do anything alone. Get cooperation for, I would say, the ideal number is three to four organizations. More is too much, and doing everything on your own is too little. So I would say join hands with other government agencies, other government offices, and don't do everything that one organization leads the entire thing. it's a, I don't know, it's an obvious advice, but you have to get people that are really into it, that really love it. You have to find that guy in the right organization, in the air navigation service provider, in Regulator and have that SWAT team being set up. Be sure that these guys get the authorities, get the approvals, get backed up from their managers. that's true in, in, in many issues. You have to get the right people really enthusiastic about it. And again, having, personal, connection with everyone on board. So meeting a lot, understanding the other guy's problem, not making decisions on your own. For sure you don't understand the full picture of your partner. And you have to have ongoing, very good, relationship, personal, and only then you will get to a much more educated, decision and it will save you time, in the future for granted funding goes without saying again for every problem in the world. And get the regulator on board and making sure that he's giving some sort of flexibility and that he has the ability and the will to help you. If a regulator wants to help you, they have ways. Every regulator has its ways, so you just have to get him on board. These are the top advices for people just starting a national drone initiative.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">When you look around the world and you see drone operations, being conducted, where are you most impressed?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Libby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right now, Dallas.

Ireland, a lot of good things are going on in Ireland, thing that's really impressive in Europe is the regulation, the way they do regulation. We're very good, you could say, at practical experience. We, we hear of an idea and we run away and fly it. We want to experiment, to play with it, with our feet wet. That's one approach. The Europeans, I think, have a different, more strict approach, looking at the problem from one hand to the other, back and forth.

It has some disadvantages, but I think staying too much time at the offices and drilling too deep into a third class, and remote scenarios in your risk assessment, it sometimes gets, not very effective, and I would suggest to put a limit on that and go out to the field and get your feet wet, get your feet wet, in not in the most, favorable environments. And this is where I come to Israel. I invite companies, first of all, to come see what's going on here without, without coming with your drones yet. But I do invite countries to learn from others experience. We have been very open and we invite everyone to come and witness with their own eyes, not the Zoom, not video calls, coming, meeting the companies, being in our, a control center, and then come fly, and because you're gonna hit that problems at one point or another. So start that early. I think the risk assessment can support that. Sure, you're taking a bit more risk that your drone might have a malfunction. But if you do it over an uninhabited area, then come on, start flying. Let's put up a USSP first in a remote area. Combine a couple of companies. experiment. that's my main, message. And the second one is come do it in Israel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:10:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, great.

The viability of it has been proven very clearly. That this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think there has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:54\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space podcast and our conversation with Bobby Healy, CEO and Founder of Manna Drone Delivery. Bobby was a standout guest when we had him on the podcast back in March of 22, and we're delighted he could join us for a return visit today. Returning guests, give us such a cool perspective. They provide an update on the original assumptions and actual outcomes of the last two years. And with Bobby drone delivery overall, and more specifically Manna Drone Delivery, he reminds us of the original assumptions, what has actually occurred and what's been pleasant and disappointing surprises and how he sees the future and perhaps differently than his original assumptions. For those of who know Bobby and listen to his original conversation, you know he's a compelling, articulate industry veteran and accomplished aviation business professional. He's both a person who understands the technology and its application, and combines this with decades of aviation knowledge. And highly successful aviation technology implementation. This isn't always the case with some of the innovators and leaders in advanced air mobility. And it's perhaps one of the reasons more our app to bet on Bobby's projects and his vision for the future. And as we do with all guests, we listened to their important messages and we politely challenge their core underlying assumptions. And we've done the same with Bobby. Listen to what Bobby says is the killer app for drone delivery. Do you agree? He provides details with market size and price, which is refreshing. He talks about the value of B2C versus B2B in drone delivery. This in itself would make for a good podcast discussion as a lot of companies are focusing on B2B delivery. One of Bobby's essential messages is that the economics have now been proven for this space. Listen to his discussion of business and operational profitability. As we all know, getting to profitability is a challenge for any business. And it has been particularly challenging for some in advanced air mobility. Listen to how we discusses how Manna wants to power big and small brands directly. As an example, he has a deal with Coca Cola, where he flies their products. He discusses how he simply wants to replace the road and that consumers will and should never go back to road based delivery. If you listen carefully, you'll hear why Bobby has been more successful than others. I was a bit surprised by technology is actually deploying in house versus what others would hope he would purchase from outside technology providers. And finally listen to where Bobby believes advanced air mobility investments should be made beyond drone delivery. His answers may or may not surprise you. So many, thanks to Bobby for rejoining us and to our listeners, we hope you enjoy our talk with Bobby Healy as you innovate and generate profits in The Vertical Space. Bobby kicked off his career building video games for Nintendo. He then founded Eland technologies an airline technology company, which he sold 12 years later to SITA. He then built Car Trawler the world's largest mobility marketplace for airlines over 15 years and led two successful LBOs for the business. For the last four years he's been building Manna a\"Drone Delivery as a Service\" business, whose mission is to improve the world by making lightning fast, suburban deliveries, affordable green and safe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>5:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, welcome back to The Vertical Space. We first spoke in March of 2022 and so we thought it would be great to bring you back and talk about the drone delivery industry and what has changed there, as well as what has changed with Manna. A lot of things have changed. So time to debunk some myths.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:02\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And it's great to be here again, guys. I'm really looking forward to it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Perfect. As you know, we typically ask if there's something that few in the industry agree with you on, would you amend your original answer or something else that's on your mind?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>6:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">If you look at my LinkedIn, you'll see that argument or the main arguments play out. Most people assume, not people in our industry, but generally people think that the use case is critical products, medical, defibrillators, urgent, societally beneficial products, and they are great use cases for sure. But the economic reality is that coffee and takeaway food is the killer app for what we do. That's one thing that most people, they don't disagree, they're just uninformed. They haven't done the work or the research that we've done on where the market opportunity is. And then the second one kind of hand in hand with that is a lot of people believe again, incorrectly that the unit economics or the capital economics don't work right now that they will at some point in the future when some magical technology comes along to make them work. But that's where I find, I enjoy myself the most on LinkedIn answering some of the people that have, raised those questions because I mean, I have the data, we have the flights, we're operating with profitable economics now. And I do enjoy engaging with people on the many misconceptions that are in our industry. And thankfully, we've already debunked them, not in theory or research. We're actually flying the debunk, even today as we speak we're flying aircraft in Dublin that are running profitable unit economics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>7:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I would add that even when we talk to industry insiders, there is a tendency to think that B2B delivery use cases will be the ones that scale first, or at least if you asked them a couple years ago. There was a general tendency to believe that urgent cargo, high value not necessarily high volume movement will be the one that gains traction initially, especially because of the, arguably easier safety case to build with predetermined points in the network, as opposed to ad hoc, don't really know where the next order will come up, low value, you know, how in the world can you make money, delivering coffee and meals, et cetera, et cetera. Yet, as we often discuss on the podcast, those use cases didn't really scale past POCs and pilots, globally, whereas the, B2C delivery, the kind that Manna is doing is really starting to show some interesting inflection.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>8:44\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I agree. In the end we're running an infrastructure and that infrastructure is an airline. It's a cargo airline. And just like any other airline, utilization is a key factor in the profitability of that airline. And every airline in the world talks about load factor or utilization in our world. And you don't get that with high priority, critical goods, the volume just isn't there. So there's no world where you can make, those critical medical type deliveries a very interesting business from a commercial standpoint. And the other thing is you don't learn anything by doing that. Other than building an aircraft, you don't really learn anything. The real learning in serving the space we serve is in being in the trenches doing five, six hundred, a thousand deliveries a day out of a small car park and getting a 30 second turnaround time and embedding that learning into the software, into the hardware and iterating through that. So unfortunately, and there's a number of great players in our space that are doing and have done a really good job, pioneering job, I would say in medical delivery, but it doesn't translate in any way whatsoever to suburban, backyard, high throughput delivery. it's just two totally different paradigms and two different things to optimize.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Some of the guests we've had on have sometimes mentioned coffee delivery in a trivial way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Disparaging way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yes. And so, so when, as you're saying, listen, it's a, is it a good start for you? Is it a good proving ground for you? But can you scale and meet your financial projections that you want to hit in the next three years, delivering coffee?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>10:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already, every single coffee delivery we do is profitable. So 100 percent of them now, like we used to be at the weekends because we'd have higher utilization and then, weekdays were less so, but now our volume has diluted the fixed cost per location so they are profitable. And the thing about coffee is there isn't a product as popular on the planet for adults on a daily basis that has the adoption rate and the frequency and the gross margin that works so well that where the benefits of flying in a straight line as we do underwrite the new mode of delivering these products. So in a world where there's no such thing really as coffee delivery and people are now, I mean, you know, Starbucks or Starbucks drive thru is an example of Starbucks mobile app, people are absolutely addicted to, I would say, high consumption patterns, high frequency purchasing coffee. So of course it's going to be the best product. But now you say, people do trivialize it. Yes, only because I think not from a business sense, they're not saying coffee isn't a great product, but they're really saying, I think, is using the airspace to deliver a coffee seems like a bad idea to me. That's really what they're saying without saying it. And that's the purpose of I think regulation and the standards like Part 108 or in our case, U-Space in Europe, standards that are scalable that do allow high throughput in that airspace below 500 feet. And when we look at the market size we estimate that today there's 5. 2 billion food deliveries a year from the top four aggregators annually growing at 15%. So think DoorDash Uber eats all the way down and that's with a constrained market where there's a labor shortage, there's labor costs, economics problems, and there's a quality issue. So, so therefore those 5. 2 billion orders, road based orders are coming from customers that want it come hell or high water. Even if it's a bad customer experience and it's expensive. And the U S customer is paying nearly a 60 percent premium on basket value to get that pizza delivered. And they're never happy with it, but look, 5. 2 billion orders. So that's the current market. Our estimate puts it at a 16 billion order market without even trying, if we can remove the road from the equation and use aircraft. So you tell me one industry where you have probably a hundred billion dollar market staring at you in the face that's untapped, where the technology has proven we've already got positive uni economics. And the only thing between us and that giant market, I guess there's a social acceptance thing. You can't go too fast, too quickly. There's some regulatory, things still to unlock. But if you side that up beside blood delivery or vaccine delivery or whatever, it just dwarfs that space. And we didn't want to take on something easy. We wanted to take on the most impactful, space and that is everyday goods to everyday people in every suburban house on the planet profitably. And we're at the start of that now.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>13:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">The other thing that strikes me about the coffee and the last mile consumer delivery is that you have the opportunity for a very consistent operation in order to make deliveries into all those customers in the market. By and large, they're already accustomed to ordering things from their phone from the ground based delivery aggregators. And in contrast, when we went and looked into the B2B medical delivery space, at least in the developed world, the companies face a pretty involved enterprise integration and organizational integration for each customer or each segment of customers. How is that flight operation going to work? Who is going to have the authority to initiate a flight? All of it ends up being a pretty heavy front load, cost and integration and it's heterogeneous operations as the business grows. Whereas in this it seems you already have a foundation of educated consumers accustomed to receiving deliveries via phone operations and it lays the groundwork for a reasonable path to go and scale a company to go and address that market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>15:04\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, and there's no, enterprise sales process or there's no finding a budget somewhere in some hospital or some company's budget to try and do this innovative new mode. Our customers are the ones that are drinking the coffee. And they're abundant and they're aware of us and it's viral and all of these tailwinds to what we're doing that don't exist in the enterprise market. And then the other thing is we, again, we look at different densities. So European population density is much higher than US population density in suburbs. So for example, in Europe, we use a lot of motorbikes to move blood around between hospital critical to beat the traffic and it's very hard to justify, you know, why would you spend a large infrastructure budget and drones when the motorbike network's already there, largely run by volunteers. it's just sometimes forcing technology into a place where technology doesn't belong. Now different in Africa or, you know, countries that don't have transport infrastructure anyway. And of course there, you're not providing drone delivery. You're providing transport infrastructure. But there's already solid transport modes in most modern economies that are not as good as drone delivery, but they're not far off. So your benefits are marginal. And then you're incurring, as you said rightly, all this overhead of cold chain of all the trail of every part of the process for that sample or whatever it is. And then of course, toxic substances. a lot of the products you might want to fly in medical areas are considered hazardous substances, so, chemotherapy drugs is a great use case, but you're into a whole other area of risk there. And we just said, look, there's parts of that prize that we're interested in and we also liked the fact that it's a critical need to deliver those products, but at the same time, it comes with just such difficult challenges on the economic side of things that from my view, it's always going to be a business that's subsidized by something. And that's, I think, why it succeeded so well in Africa to date. And I think honestly, it's going to be challenged in other markets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>17:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I may say something really quickly, we can move on from this. As it relates to medical delivery, and in clinical pathology versus anatomic pathology, so blood versus tissue, I think an argument could be made that there's high volume of both, and tissue pathology will have a much higher critical factor, and there'll be a lot of price behind that, because there's a sensitivity to it where that may be a good market. I think they're both relatively high volume, but one difference between a cup of coffee is that the economics may not play out unless there's a lot of volume in the delivery. They're not going to pay a lot for one piece of blood, and I think one thing we discovered, Luka and Peter, on one of our podcasts was what's the real value of getting it there a little bit faster when it's a 24 hour turn on the testing anyway? But my sense is that the, and Bobby, in hospitals, labs, there's a very large cost item set aside for courier.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that's a big element for labs. So maybe that's a next stage for you if the economics play out, but that meets a lot of your criteria, conceivably clinical and anatomic pathology, maybe.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>18:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. I mean, I'd love to be, I'm not sure I'll be proven wrong here. What I'm, I guess in the end, what I'm saying is if you're going to build an infrastructure then you underwrite the cost of an infrastructure with a viable business case, and then all the other applications can work on top of that. So if you're already in a city or a suburb or whatever it is, and you're flying trivial products, albeit you're making money doing it, why wouldn't you then deploy that for other use cases? It could be beer. It could be medicine, like you say, samples, all of these things. And we can pick products up as well as drop them off. And why wouldn't you deploy? Of course you would. But you don't start with that because you're always going to be building a business that needs to be subsidized by something. And again, it comes back to ambition and scale. And for us, the ambition is unlimited. And we say, what is the biggest use case that we can solve? And it is, no matter what you say. It's always going to be the suburban household and their needs. And that's going to be what will underwrite the infrastructure for any successful player in this space. It ain't going to be medical.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>19:40\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, you talk about the potential to expand the market from what 5. 2 billion deliveries per year today with the ground based aggregators to something much larger. When you look at the differences that drone delivery brings into the equation, whether it's speed or environmental advantages or a safety case or cost, what do you see as being the key drivers that are creating the behavior change that leads you to think that there's a 16 billion a year, delivery opportunity?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>20:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">There's existing numbers that show adoption rates of road based delivery between 4 and 5% around the world and they kind of point to a low take up rate and there's our own data as well. and there's different states. I think that the restaurants are a small business. Think the consumer at the end of it all. And you look at the different things that they think are important. And in the case of the restaurant, restaurants frequently, they just can't, they can't get delivery, right? It's just too expensive. They can't do it themselves. The aggregators that power them, the, DoorDashes and Ubers and so on, that power them and themselves are constrained with output as well, if it rains, if the weather's bad in any way, or if it's peak time, you just can't meet the demand peaks, with people, it just doesn't work. So the result is batching, where multiple orders are put in with one driver and therefore cold food or terrible quality food and unpredictable times. And that's reflected in the NPS or the ratings of all of the aggregators, which are on the floor, not because they're not great businesses. They are, but they're constrained by just a limited output that they have. So why are we different? Because we're point to point. our average flight time is just less than three minutes. Physics is on our side. And when you have that advantage, the outcome is look, it's literally as simple as the outcome is hot food or hot coffee or, and in good condition. And that is remarkably the most important thing. It isn't speed. It will speed kind of translates into quality, but also reliability and predictability, which is as important as quality. People are willing to wait 15 minutes or 20 minutes. They are willing so long as that's what it is. But with batching and traveling, the traveling salesman algorithm, there's no way to be sure about that. So, so the variability is very poor. And so the consumer is going to modify their behavior because of drone delivery and the advantages it has. And we already see that in something as simple as coffee delivery. And before we existed, there was no such thing as coffee delivery in suburbs. That nobody would be crazy enough to do that because you won't make any money but yet our basket value in our coffee shop is more than twice the the basket value of the average order in the coffee shop itself, because behavior, right? It's a household order. So it's 2. 3 beverages per basket. There's a bunch of pastries and so on and then the other stakeholder for us, as I said, the vendor, the small business, they're looking at this saying they're now able to reach a couple of hundred thousand up to half a million customers in their catchment area of less than a five minute flight. And they're saying this is massive for their business. So. That's another stakeholder. And then the final stakeholder for us is the aggregator itself. And we'd expect our business is going to be, we call it B2B. And what we mean by B2B is we just want to be a delivery company. So we want to power the aggregators. We want to power the big brands. We have a deal with Coca Cola where we fly their products, but we want to power all of the big and the small brands directly, simply replacing the road. And so you think about the aggregators and their numbers are public. The aggregators lose money on most of their orders in suburbs because of the time it takes to deliver them and the labor costs and the labor laws. So we know the benefits to them are actually simply unit economics. we can do a delivery for them cheaper than they can do it themselves quite simply, and still make a strong margin ourselves because of our operating economics. So there's different stakeholders, but it, and some of them, it's about economics and some of them it's about experience and quality, and some of it, it's about growing the market. And by the way, the five to 16 primarily comes from number one is actually just widening the addressable market. So you're going from where the aggregators really only want to do very dense areas and quite short trips to obviously optimize their costs. We can now do much longer trips and support much less population dense areas. So you're actually widening the market to those like 92 million detached single family homes in the USA. And similarly in Europe, there's these really fragmented towns, suburb cities that aren't that easy to address for the traditional mode. So it's a combination of just customer behavior, I think, and market addressability.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>24:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, I mean, you answered the question, but I was going to ask if there are categories of products that people just wouldn't consider ordering via ground based delivery because they just know it's going to take too long, like a latte or something. And are you seeing that people will order those products given their expectation that it will arrive faster via a drone.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>25:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, we survey them as well. And quite interesting. If you look at lots of publicly available data, the key categories for road based delivery are, in order, if I just pick one market, the UK, where there's great data. And it's quite similar in the USA as well, but there's the top one is pizza. And then it's, other products like Indian or Chinese and burgers and fries is like fourth or fifth in the list of, perishable prepared meals. But actually if you ask people what they want to eat, burgers and fries is the number one thing. So what's going on there is people already know that certain products just don't deliver well, they don't travel well, and anyone that's got a road based delivery of burgers and fries knows that after 20 minutes, it's just toxic. So, so therefore you can't reheat it either. So, so consumers know not to order these things. So in the existing road based data, there's a hidden demand that's there that's not satisfied. We know that already from ours. And our number one, outside of coffee, our second one is probably tied between burgers and fries and ice cream. And an ice cream is an interesting one because you don't need a lot of choice in ice cream, right? You just need a quality, well known brand or two for the customer. But ice cream is interesting because it's 168 hours of the week almost, it's almost flat by hour of day of week. And it's driven by family orders, right? These are orders that have an experience associated with them, like a party or watching a movie or things like that. And the alternative is getting your car for 35 or 40 minutes to get the ice cream if you don't happen to have it. So we do see people now starting to rely on us for certain categories like coffee and ice cream that they might've pre purchased a week at a time and stored it in their fridge before, and now they just don't care cause they can get it from us and then the really the alarm bells, I think in a good way that ring for us is that burgers and fries in terms of meals are number one category. And finally, I would say people are saying, finally, I can get French fries. It actually tastes like French fries and they arrive. And I know that sounds trivial, but it isn't. It's the flagship product of McDonald's, right? I mean, French fries. I started this business because I wanted a bag of French fries and we call them chips in Ireland. I joke about it, but I did. And it's one of those, highly sought after products that delivery just fails.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>27:51\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I mean, Uber is a great case study in how an addressable market can expand when you introduce a new capability or a new user experience. I don't have the data to back this up, but I'm just basing this on my own consumption patterns and those close to me, but I'd be comfortable saying that a lot of Uber users their budgets for taxi and black cars prior to Uber were not the same as their Uber budgets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>28:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And the amount of music people consume now, it's Spotify. there's things that consumers never would have told you they wanted until you gave it to them and then they're absolutely reliant on it. It's like air and we'll be the same. We already are in the towns we operate in. It's just, people are blown away by the fact that they can get our service but at the same time, they straight away adjust to it and they start to get angry with us if we're 60 seconds late it almost feels like for some of them. So, so, and that's a good thing. it really is the end of road based delivery. When you offer this service, consumers never going back to road based delivery. And I think that's not unexpected. Our job has been at the engineering level to make sure that no matter what the weather is, they wouldn't need to go back. So that means flying in minus 20 C plus 42 C, very strong winds, I think 35 mile an hour winds, things like that, rain, obviously snow. And if you don't do all of those things and really from an engineering point of view, harden the product, you don't have a business. There's no point being a drone delivery business for fair weather because the restaurants and the customers that you're powering, they'll just, they just, if you, if they can't trust that you're going to always be there, you're a novelty, you're the circus. And that's not who we want to be. So you have to start with the very hardest of solutions and an engineer for that. And when I think about what advice I would give people, you can't start in this business with a halfway house. You have to have the final, picture solved. That's a mistake we nearly made at the start. And just by sheer luck, we happen to be in Ireland, which is the worst country in the world to do a drone delivery business, permanently raining, permanently windy. So therefore we can fly in any weather, but it comes back to, and it's very important. I know it sounds like engineering, but I'm trying not to be too engineering about this. But if you want to be real in drone delivery you have to replace the car fully. You can't be partial replacement. And that makes it much more difficult. The engineering equation is just much harder and the testing equation is much harder. Even the delivery mode, the way we deliver the software we've written for that arrival at the house and delivering, it looks simple. but it's not, it's quite the opposite. And then testing that out in the wild and, is one thing in a big field in the middle of nowhere, but testing it where there's customers underneath you, is a whole other thing. And that takes so much time. Sorry, I'm wondering, but it goes to what do you need to solve for, right? You need to solve for predictability, availability, speed equals quality, cost, unit cost, and yeah. So safety, I don't even talk about safety because you don't have a right to exist, if you're not safe and that comes down to, yes, we have governance because we're regulated by aviation regulators and a lot of oversight comes from that. But. It doesn't make you safe. There's a million ways to still not be safe, even if you're regulated. I think that comes from, there's a, there's an existential threat hanging over the industry if it's irresponsible when it starts to scale. And what that translates to, It took us five years and I don't think you're going to do much quicker than that. And when you start developing a backyard delivery product to, to really scaling it, which is where we are now, it's somewhere between three to five years timeline. And no amount of fantastic engineering, or engineers speed that up. It's a process of gradually evolving, crawl, walk, run more and more volume. You can't please the investors with this one. You have to manage them and let them know that it's a long, arduous process to make sure that you're safe. And I certainly see that in the industry, we've done a great job at that. I don't see anyone pretending that it can go, at blitz scaling pace, but it will, and I think there's a number of, operators like ourselves, like Wing, for example, Google's program that are now ready to start some really, serious growth in a safe way. So, but it is not your typical industry where a five year path normally to a startup, building a viable product with viable economics and the start of a revenue journey. That's very difficult, space by any measure. And so it'll come to what's the market look like in, in a decade, who'll be there, how many will be there, that kind of thing. Just because you mentioned the word safety, what it translates to is a market that's going to be a very few number of players with sufficient deep pockets and patience to get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:12\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So, Bobby, delving into the customer experience a little bit more. Are you, guiding customers towards expectations for how long it will take for different categories of products to arrive from the time that they push order on their phone? What is a reasonable expectation for a latte versus a hamburger and fries versus other takeout food. Obviously the drone delivery operation itself is a consistent time period, but the preparation time and the other\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">what should customers be expecting?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>33:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. There's a very difficult problem to solve actually and the big aggregators have, have done the best job at this simply because of time and the data that they have. Truth is a restaurant that's preparing meals is a very unpredictable output line, particularly smaller ones. And from a day to day or hour to hour basis, quite difficult to predict. Now there's some very large brand players. I don't need to name names, you know, they are, but they can produce a meal every 20 seconds and they can get one through their drive through every 35 seconds. And so for those types of brands, we can tell the customer down to the minute when they can expect to see their nuggets or their fries or whatever it is land in their back garden, essentially for the others, and we have a number of vendors that are, they're a super product, but they're erratic to say the least. So we tell the customer it's a three minute flight or a two minute flight or whatever it is based on the range and the wind. And then we say, and the prep time for this restaurant is between five minutes and you know, with Google flights, you get this kind of bar chart of likely we give them a bar chart of likely arrival times based on the vendor's prep time. And we tell them what's happening as well. So they know in our app or through our API with our B2B partners, they know when the vendor started to prepare, they know when the vendors finished preparing, they know when we've received the goods from the vendor. They know when it's been loaded onto the aircraft. They know when the aircraft's taken off and then they can track it in real time. So the reason we do all of those things is the customer can always see progression and that's important. So the customer does not mind waiting 15 minutes 20 minutes for their burgers and fries, so long as you keep them updated on that progress. And so we measure time by stages, but if I look at my order to arrival time. So it's a time the customer pressed the purchase button to the arrival time. We see a range for products like our Coca Cola delivery, the median time for the aircraft to take off after the order is two minutes. Flight time is three minutes. So, so median time about five minutes all the way up to the premium, we've got this French guy that makes these, delicious sandwiches, but he takes 20 minutes to make the sandwich, but again, it isn't about the actual time. It's about the confidence in that time. And look, our NPS, our net promoter score is 86 year to date. And that's because we have this obvious advantage that we fly, but also we manage, as you say, the customer expectations very clearly. through constant messaging of progression of their\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>36:31\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay. So as you scale and demand increases, how do you keep customer expectations realistic? If it's coming up on lunchtime and you get a bunch of, order interest coming in and you have only so much, delivery capacity during that hour and that, beyond a certain amount, deliveries are going to be delayed simply because you're waiting for a free drone to go and make that flight. How do you prevent customer disappointment with the experience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>37:00\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And we have an advantage there over road as well, because we know if we look forward at the next 60 minutes and we calculate capacity in the next 60 minutes for any given GPS points, we know pretty accurately how many orders we can handle for the next 60 minutes. And that's the window where, it's actually between 30 and 60 minutes where a customer will say, I'm not willing to wait that long. I'll drive myself or I'll do without. So the first and foremost, there's no point adding capacity blindly if you don't know how to assess it in real time. So the way we look at it is we continually add capacity in units, as our repeat cohort of customers grows, so too does our volume, orders per hour, per day of week, and that's pretty easy to anticipate, and we just allocate extra capacity ahead of time. Overcapacity for us isn't such an issue when you look at the aircraft utilization, because we don't care so much about an aircraft sitting on the tarmac. We care about the people's cost, the people cost that would load that aircraft cargo, they're there anyway. So when we flex up and down capacity, it's more about flexing up and down the people that manage or load cargo or monitor those aircraft than the actual aircraft themselves.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:20\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So the most utilization sensitive component of your operation is utilization of your human labor, not utilization of your airframes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>38:30\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Correct. Yeah, we don't really care about utilization of the airframes. I mean, we do, but in the end, don't forget we have mobile aircrafts. Our aircraft can load balance from one cell to the other. In other words, the aircraft can autonomously go from one location to another to serve demand in different locations. So we can dynamically allocate the fleet to. And there's other great use cases like parcel delivery, postal delivery, for example, and pharmacy delivery, even that you can take orders with a four hour window on them and just send them in underutilized slots. So we can balance our utilization through the day, particularly daytime hours. So I think as we grow, there'll be more of those what we call latent orders that have a window of delivery time that don't need instant delivery that we will use our fleets to fly. So I'm not too concerned about the aircraft itself. It's the people and we have two modes of operation. We have one where we're highly centralized, all the aircraft and a handful of people. And also, for example, one of our people can load between 20 and 30 flights per hour. So that's our number, right? and 20 or 30 flights per hour is the best you're going to do because our turnaround time is between 30 and 60 seconds, right? Aircraft landing, aircraft taking off and that you can't beat that. No, there's no way to beat that number. But that's the cost, right? That's that person's cost for those 20 or 30 deliveries. And you want them fully utilized. So if you're over budgeted on those people, then you're going to increase your cost per delivery. So that's the way to think about it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>40:09\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, what's been the biggest change in the drone delivery market in the last two years since we talked?

And like I said, I always, I'm not a great mathematician, but if you scale a negative number, you get a larger negative number, no matter how hard you try. no, look, we already have$4 in and around sometimes less, sometimes more dependent time of the week and the cargo cost per delivery fully loaded. Right. That's, and we're going to, by the way, publish this data, both on LinkedIn and through our friends at McKinsey. And so you'll see it and, but you can also see a very clear path to$2 cost for delivery, like literally with our eyes closed, we won't get there at the end of this year. We won't be far off it, but even limited scaling will bring us to a$2 cost per delivery. And what we want to win at is that, going back to the Warren Buffett, right, in a commodity world and drone delivery, ultimately, at scale and over 20 years commodity, right, it's A to B safely and quickly. The winner will be the ones that have the best cost of operation. This is why Ryanair succeeded, is why Southwest did so well in the earlier days. And we learned from history of running businesses that it's not the coolest product that's going to win in this space. Nobody cares. it's about the cost. So, so what's changed, I think we've demonstrated in superb fashion that the industry is viable, economically viable, and I think that's important. And then I think regulatory wise, again, we now fly BVLOS all over Europe. We have license all over Europe. Europe has really strong, difficult, but really clear regulations. USA has moved forward at pace as well. We see pretty much everyone operating with 135s, we see Google really starting to expand their operations, we see major brands like Walmart really leaning into it, so I would say ahead of expectations in Europe, for sure, and what we would have predicted in the USA as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>42:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What about a disappointment, Bobby?

I would love to see, and we would love to be flying under 108, very soon, but, still uncertain and uncertainty kills an industry like ours, well, it doesn't kill it, but it just makes it very difficult for companies like us to continue to grow and raise money to grow when there's uncertainty around the regulatory environment. And so 108's a discipline. Well, it's not a disappointment. It's great. We love it. It's the right shape. It feels exactly what the industry needs to scale. It's just hard to say when those, rules will be written and we'll go through the process and become, routine. So is it a disappointment? No, like I'm pretty happy that we have BVLOS in Europe. There's, 500 million people here, 300 million of which we can reach. so there's plenty of business. And I would say to any drone delivery company. get over here and start flying. Like Google are flying a mile away from my house here, where I'm recording this from, Europe is a fantastic place to build some scale. It's not as great a market the USA, it's a market where you can really get flying anyway. So, so disappointments, they're not really disappointments. They're just, it's the, I just wish it could all move a little bit more quickly in the USA. and other than that, I think we're in really strong shape.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:23\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How should we make sense of the different operating cost numbers that we see in the industry media or being talked about across the different companies that are doing this? From your vantage point, do you know if they're all being formulated the same way? Are we talking about apples to apples or apples to oranges with these numbers?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>44:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think, there's some wishful thinking in some of the things that I've, seen. I would say, remembering WeWork and community adjusted EBITDA is the phrase I would think of here. You have to include packaging cost, battery motor depreciation, prop depreciation, maintenance, aircraft depreciation, personnel, all of the other costs, but those are the main ones that I listed there. If all of those aren't in your unit economics there's already a problem and particularly aircraft depreciation. So again, that goes to our aircraft has a useful life of 75, 000 deliveries. And that means that our depreciation factor is relatively low. And that's an intentional part of our product design, even battery management, battery maintenance, those ones should be equal for everybody, right, because we're all using lithium ion in some way. And we're charging them at different speeds, discharging them at different speeds, but largely speaking, while we think we're better than most on battery, I think you could pretty much assume that everyone's the same in that regard. I think where all of the players differ greatly is in longevity of the aircraft, how many cycles you're going to get from the aircraft. It's throughput per hour. And that comes to hot swap architecture or not hot swap and then charging in situ kind of the opposite of hot swap. Charging in situ means that your battery won't last as long. And after the person loading the cargo, battery is your biggest unit cost. And what I mean by that is if you're charging a battery in sub zero temperatures, or if you're charging a battery in very high temperatures, it's not going to live as long as a battery that's charged at a consistent temperature indoors. And that comes down to aircraft architecture and operational architecture. In other words, hot swap battery, the battery's only outdoors for 60 seconds before it flies. We've thought about all of that and we've thought about it because of our focus on unit costs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>46:49\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Okay, so you're treating batteries and motors as consumables. Those are not going 75, 000 flights. Those are being replaced periodically, but it's the remainder of the aircraft that you assert has a 75, 000 flight life. Okay, so how many flight hours, just from an aviation standpoint, comparing the expected life of this aircraft in terms of flight hours? How many is that? Roughly 15, 000 flight hours?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:18\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, it's a divide by eight, divide by eight. We do eight flights an\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:22\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">hour So what is the remainder of that airframe? What data do you have that, gives you confidence that this is a 75, 000 flight item? And what's your approach to continued airworthiness and maintenance of that object over that time?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>47:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Data. So our old aircraft, we call it the 3.8, was a 20, 000 flights aircraft. And we've never written one off before that, but we have many of them that have done more than that. We've a couple of aircraft over 20, 000, 25, 000 flights each. So we have formed there. We know what are the things to engineer for. When you talk about our newer aircraft, which we call 3.8.4 really it's functionally no different than our old aircraft, except for the propulsion system, which is a, it's a much easier maintenance system because most of the failures in our previous aircraft came down to wear and tear during maintenance, during routine changes of parts of the subsystem, props or, motors. So our new aircraft airframe, a single piece of carbon fiber, no moving parts. And that is easy to cycle, right? It's very easy to cycle that airframe through actually half a million flight cycles, on simulator on test benches, should I say, and get the data. And that's the process for evaluating what the lifetime of each component is. You're right, our motors and our batteries and props actually, for that matter, are in our unit cost. So we write off motors after 2000 hours. We write off batteries, in a number of flights, a number of cycles. So it's very predictable. And props less predictable although there's expected lifetime for props, it's mostly, preemptive, I would say monitoring for imperfections or damage to props and changing, but it's stack ranked it's battery, motor, props. And then we apply just a consistent percentage overhead to the entire bill of materials on the aircraft outside of that annual cost, which is quite conservative to get the look, this cable failed or that, that LIDAR unit failed or whatever, because components fail individually and in very unpredictable ways. And so I think the right approach there is just apply a consistent proportion of the overall bill of materials in an annual tax almost in form of maintenance and component switching. And we're, we've been in this five years, we think we have very good data on that. So we're, and as I said, we're quite conservative on it, but it's still overall the depreciation of the entire system for per flight is quite low. It's certainly lower than the person loading the cargo. And then continued airworthiness or maintenance and, the traditional aviation part of things, I would say our old aircraft or existing aircraft depending on what you're day you're operating on, is an aircraft that required a lot of overhead, a lot of maintenance inspections, frequent inspections, frequent overhauls. And we moved now to our new aircraft that just self diagnoses everything, designed for high throughput, long time without even an inspection. But it still backs down to very traditional aviation practices for keeping aircraft in the air and ensuring that they're safe. We, I don't think we're any different there than company that flies small planes or helicopters in the processes, the training, all that stuff that happens.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>50:58\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Given that you'll be publishing some numbers soon, are you comfortable sharing with our audience some high level,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Of course I\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">major cost drivers and the specific\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>51:08\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I actually, I predicted you would ask me, so I actually got a breakdown. Yeah. Yeah. Are you ready? Well, why wouldn't I talk about this? Because we, we do the best, right? So, so today,$4.27 cost per delivery of which fixed overhead, 71 cents, labor$1.93 consumables and depreciation,$1.63. That's where we are today. And then by the end of this year, well, look, I don't want to promise too much, but that'll probably be closer to$3 than even$3.50. Yeah. And then if I look at the human costs, so, and this comes to our operation, which again will evolve. We have different roles. So we have what we call a dispatcher, which is what others would call a pilot, that's a person that for us can monitor up to 20 aircraft simultaneously. What role they have? I don't know, because there's no sticks. There's no control of our aircraft, but they're there anyway, monitoring, but our loaders is our biggest cost. So, so that those are people that just take cargo from a vendor, load on the aircraft, just over a dollar per delivery. That's interesting because Ireland, in fact, Europe is a high wage environment, and so our hourly cost for labor is about$18. so if you look at that and then you look at our future system, which does not need those loaders, so when I talk about going from$3 to$2, that loader for us goes away and the vendor loads the cargo. So we're not in a rush to do that. We have the system built, we're happy. But for now we want to operate just highly centralized, very well managed, location. So we have that loader cost. And the number of the$1.63 that I mentioned earlier on in consumables, I can tell you stack ranked in there it's battery is roughly 50 percent of that currently that'll come down a bit with new battery chemistry we have, and then motors is second at about 25% and then maintenance, just a fixed cost of maintenance per flight that we apply and props and replacement components is the remainder of it. And there are some benefits to scale purchasing of these were obviously tiny now in terms of scale of purchasing. So that$1.63 we predict at scale will come down to about 45 cents. And so when we get from$4.27, where we are now, down to$3 or say$2 and 2 cents is the number I'm looking at, the bulk of that comes from reducing our consumables cost by just scale and better purchasing power. And then there's a pretty significant, unlock for us in change of battery chemistry, so going to a more conservative battery chemistry, but one that has a higher number of cycles and that comes from, again, this, we see this as a major advantage that our system has is that we don't need to charge our batteries and anything over 1C. So we can charge them slowly because the aircraft isn't waiting for a charge with us, so we might have seven, eight, nine battery systems, cargo systems per aircraft, and one of them is flying while eight of them are charging, so we can charge them very slowly and therefore get many more cycles out of the battery. And that, that counts in this space. It really does count. The top level architecture we have, we think it is designed for throughput, of course, productivity of real estate space, but also it flows through that because we have this hotswap battery, our costs per delivery are quite a bit lower than I think for people that are charging in situ, but look, those are the numbers. And we're actually going to publish the whole thing in detail for everyone to look at, but there should be no surprises in there. And I think largely our lower cost is driven by our higher throughput per hour.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Are these contribution costs, Bobby, or what costs are not included?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>55:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So those are pretty much everything. Those are fixed overheads that we apply, like things like rent and electricity and things like that diluted over the volume of deliveries.

So don't forget our cost gets diluted by the number of drones, right? And then that's proportional to the utilization of that same number of drones. So if we've resourced it correctly, in terms of the human loaders, then you need a 55 percent utilization of that capacity to reach those numbers. Those are numbers that we deliver today based on our existing volume.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What does that translate in terms of, daily deliveries per aircraft?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:52\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we do all of that with less than 300 deliveries a day for our four aircraft.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>56:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">But there are delivery surges, in the morning, at lunchtime, different parts of the day, and then there are low periods. Is that right? And so if that's the current demand pattern, 55 percent is your threshold for these cost numbers, what is a reasonable expectation for the high end of utilization that you can achieve,\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. Yeah.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">have demand surges during the day and slack period?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>57:19\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah, exactly. So volume is what takes care of that, Peter. So you, you reduce. Or should I say you increase the granularity of utilization as volume grows, right? So we already see weekends, for example, we operate 12 hours a day. Weekends are, I wouldn't say I haven't looked last week, but they're north of 90 percent utilization now on weekends. And what we probably should do is add more aircraft and drive more demand, but we are not motivated by volume. We've never been motivated by volume for this stage of the business. We've been always motivated by those KPIs around cost per delivery and optimizing for that. So we're about to open two other bases in the same suburb. So we'll be bringing it up to the gigantic number of 12 aircraft, which doesn't sound like a lot to most folks, but that's a thousand deliveries a day for us, more than a thousand deliveries a day cause they're very productive aircraft. And if we're successful at getting that over time, if we fill that capacity, which we will, once we switch on certain new channels, but think probably across the week, it'll be anywhere from 400 to a thousand real deliveries a day in the suburb. you'll have always have that right, but we'll flex up and down the human resourcing part of that across those, days of the week and hours of the day. And we, we think a natural place to be is about 70 percent utilization and at 70 percent utilization, we're somewhere between 2 and 3 cost per delivery.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>58:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You already mentioned that this is all beyond visual line of sight, and that the loaders are the only people involved, so no visual observers. Can you talk about how the, mission execution is done with the supervisors and any progress on the 1:many front.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>59:16\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Well, for us BVLOS is one to many. And for us, that happened at a year ago where we went from many to one. So we had like two point, two point, whatever people per aircraft down to now, actually practically we think it's probably 20 to one because that person, that resource really doesn't have a role. There's no mission planning. There's no nothing that there's really no role for that person, but we're happy to have that person there anyway, to observe and just to be aware. And there's certain areas, like we fly in controlled airspace as well. And Europe has this thing called U-Space. And we've worked with the folks in Google and in Wing with this as well, about de confliction and then bringing that de confliction up a level to ADS B IN to avoid traditional aircraft. Today, we do all in an automated way, but we'd also use that observer to observe the airspace, the ADS B traffic. But like I said, that cost is ultimately going to disappear completely because there's no role really there. Mission planning is automated for us, so when a customer signs up with us we don't see them. We don't talk to them. There's no interaction. they drop a pin where they would like us to deliver. And then we use data to decide if that pin is a safe place or not. And they're in the system. And when the aircraft flies to them, we do check while we're there to make sure the area is clean. In other words, it's less than a 15 degree angle. It's inanimate. There's no people underneath. And all that's automated for us so that there's no observers required. The mission planning is quite interesting actually because there's a couple of things that are surprisingly innovative in that space. I would like to say rocket science, but it's not rocket science, but the flight planning to optimize for energy use, depending on prevailing wind is important. And then we stream the weather from the aircraft that are in the air. So we have very accurate, very localized and very real time weather data that informs the next flight. And so that's a really important optimization for us in both speed of delivery, but also in, in energy drawn, which allows us to have that nice wind envelope or nice wind capability. And so that's very important, but another equally important part of what we do is mitigating ground risks. So, we have an effective population density where we fly. Like it is very populated where we fly. It is very dense. It's as dense as the Bronx or Queens, for example. It is really dense. And we're flying over about 450 houses with every single flight. So we take ground mitigation very seriously. And we do a lot of work there. And one of the feeds that we have is real time location data from users of our code, of our apps that they give us permission to have, and we'll monitor the space for hotspots of people. And that's a really important addition to what we've done. And so that data tells us, like, for example, if there's a beer garden, there's 500 people drinking beer outdoors in the middle of the summer. And we'll know they're there and we'll automate the flight plan around that. And so that for us has proven to be quite an easy thing to build where data didn't exist before. You couldn't really get that insight into where people were before. And in an anonymous way use it to mitigate your flights. So the flight planning is quite interesting in our world. And then the other part is aside from risk, just pure ground risk mitigation. You always think about, you don't want to be flying over the same places all the time. You want to avoid channels down certain areas to overbother people. So we ran, I wouldn't say randomized, but we, in the flight planning, we do a lot of work to reduce the effect of overflights. And that's been a key part of the acceptance aspect of what we're doing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:03:17\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">What third party software are you using, Bobby, in that process?

I suppose our strength as a team has been in software, our businesses before have all been software businesses and either way, I think, if there was available software to buy in that space, we'd probably have bought it if it met our needs. But you have to balance always with software. The difference between software that's 95 percent what you need and 100 percent what you need is probably five years. I'm a programmer myself. That's my trade. It's often better just to build a simple system that exactly meets your needs, then adopt a complex system that more or less meets your needs. And in our case, like it is not rocket science where we're building, we're not going to be famous for how awesome our software or our hardware is. That's not what we're going to be famous for. We're going to be famous for our lowest unit cost and our ability to scale that, I think.

I wouldn't call it strategic. I would call it an optimization. We're faster writing code. We're better at testing code. It just reduces the time to write code, but once code is written, the AI is no use to you and, we have a mature platform now, so we're more I'd say tinkering, we're optimizing doing small additions and it's very difficult to let an AI into existing code and start adding things. It's more when you write it from the start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:04:59\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Does it tilt the equation between building your own software versus buying software? The decision you would have made three years ago versus the decision that you will make three years in the future on that question.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:05:10\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I don't think so. no, it, it just, when you're assessing the number of people you need, or more importantly, you might get a, someone that's a, an average to strong programmer up a level. You might, get individuals just up a level. Like some of the code I would have written recently, and I use ChatGPT or Copilot, to write some of my own code. I'm writing code now that takes two or three days. That might've taken me a couple of weeks to write before. Mostly now when you're writing code, you're using frameworks or APIs that already exist to take a lot of learning, to take a lot of time to get to use, particularly in the AI and the vision space, and that's just like, I wrote some code recently myself that, that used our security cameras to look for people walking close to an aircraft or onto one of our landing pads. That code took me less than two days to get into production. And that's something that would have taken me a month to write before. And I'm, programming 35 years. So, so think about it that way. And I think that's the only right way to think about it. Just, it just makes existing good programmers faster and better. It doesn't replace the programmer. And so your decision, whether to buy versus build would more be about if somebody has matured a platform already that has done a scale drone delivery operation, it automatically by that fact will have evolved into the right piece of software for us, and I would buy that all day long, but nobody has written a piece of software that runs a drone delivery business at scale yet, except us. And I would say Wing. And so would I buy wing software? Yes. I would buy Wing's software, but I wouldn't buy anyone else's because the software evolves in line with the way you use it and you have to use it in order to develop it, I think.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">You mentioned earlier that the consumer pays upwards of maybe 60 percent of the value of the meal with traditional, terrestrial food delivery. How does the drone economics impact, the wallets of the customers and the restaurants?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:07:21\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So that, that number comes from actually a McKinsey work in the USA where they measured and it's, yeah, it's a 55 to 60 percent increase. So you buy a pizza for$30, you're paying$45 or a little bit more. In our case, we, I mean, you can get our app, we're charging customers$5 a delivery. And we haven't seen it. That's a little bit more expensive than they might pay for that direct. Here's my delivery fee number on the ticket. but we don't mark up the menu. We don't add surcharges. There's no tip obviously for the drone. So to the customer, actually, we're probably on a par with existing road based delivery, the way they might see it. Now it's only in the USA that everyone pays this gigantic premium on basket. In Europe they're paying about$7 fully loaded, but with tip and all that stuff. And so we're kind of in a par and I think a better question is, do we think there's room to charge more? Or do we need to charge less? and I think that's comes down to elasticity of demand. The drone does, favors there. It's really elasticity of demand on consumption, right? Whether they want the hamburger, whether they're willing to get it delivered or go outside. And if we're much more expensive than road based delivery, that's where the elasticity comes in. They're just going to go back to road based delivery. So I think our industry always needs to be on a par at worst with the existing mode or otherwise better. And then that translates again, back to our unit cost story. We think there's a world where a subscription is a real thing in drone delivery. And that's where we'd like to be. We'd ultimately like every household in the world uses us like Amazon Prime or like Spotify or just part of their monthly, thing in the household. And we think we can get marginal costs down to the point where that will work. And just like Prime or just like Spotify this is an almost inconsequential monthly cost for a household and we can use that to subsidize deliveries and still make our money by charging our partners a commission on basket value. So, we see enormous upside in the take rate or the revenue per delivery without needing to increase the cost to the consumer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:09:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">How do you expect unit cost numbers that you shared with us to change in the U.

In Europe, that means implementation of U-Space. The regulations are there, U-Space is there. It's just rolling it out, but there's already four or five countries in Europe that will have U-Space this year. And USA, I think that Part 108 is the answer for scale. I don't think 135 is, although there can be the initial growth and scaling in the USA, which I think we'll all do a little bit of, but true, unlimited, unconstrained scaling, I think needs 108. So that's the bits that are out of our control. I think everything else is just execution. It's a capital intensive world, so you need a lot of capital to scale this, even though it's got a good return on it. Like our capital returns in 14 months when we open a new location, it's funded itself after 14 months. But you still, as we're growing a lot, you're going to need, a lot of capital to fund that growth. And I think debt will be a big part of that finance of the aircraft, just like in aviation. So will that be a constraint? Probably not. So then you move on to, again, the things that are in our control, but will quickly get out of our control. If we don't act properly and responsibly as an industry and as individual operators, we'll be punished by regulation. Cities will slow us down like they did the scooter industry. If there's accidents or, anything really that worries people, that will slow us down. So there's a risk there that with the rise of good regulation and the issuing of licenses that people might try to go too fast when they're not ready. They're rushing to get an aircraft to market. They start flying it and they ruin the party for everyone else. If anything slows us down in a material way, that will be it. And will it happen? I doubt it because I think the regulator on both sides of the pond have been very thoughtful about this. And I don't think anyone will be allowed to fly at scale unless they're safe. I just don't see a world where, you're going to have, people allowed to take risk. We obviously are not going to, but I don't think it's a world where you're going to have small operators that raise a seed round and start flying around communities. I don't think that's going to happen at all. I see this being an industry of two or three big players worldwide that will operate properly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby in three years, are you a$15 million,$50 or a$500 million revenue company?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:39\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In three years,$100 million plus, I would hope to think, and that could very well be all in Europe as well with some of the contracts we've signed and with the state of the market here, there's every possibility that we could get there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:53\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And at a hundred million, you're a top three player you're saying in the world?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:12:57\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">In drone delivery, we want to be the number one.

Without giving too much away, there's north of a million dollars out of one small base for us in annual revenue. And there's 10, 000 similar suburbs in Europe alone. If we just got to a thousand of them, that's a billion dollars revenue business and with a contribution that pays for itself in 14 months.

So it isn't, obviously the marginal cost of a unit is there always. We have to manufacture, we have to deploy the boots on the ground. It's a difficult business to scale. I compare us to a Starbucks rollout back to the Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz was on the podcast recently and he broke the numbers down and he said, look, it's half a million for us to generate a million dollars in revenue. It takes two years to pay back. And so he's all about debt financing and trying to go fast, but just it's slow. And I think we won't be as badly affected by that, but that's naturally difficult part of scaling our business. It'll take a while to get to a billion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:05\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">We already touched on this in the conversation about availability, there's, two potential paths that somebody in this industry might take in terms of how deep in a given geography they want to go, whether they want to offer a full capacity service to the customer in one smaller area or expand a little bit more aggressively, but not go perhaps as deep. How do you think about that trade off?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:15:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">So we think about kind of Goldilocks suburb of hundred thousand people and up, potentially we could make slightly smaller ones work. So think 50, 000 people and up. And if you look at that as a filter, there's some other ones like number of restaurants within a hundred meter radius of an anchor restaurant, an anchor tenant, things like that. But if you filter it down, you come to about 10, 000 locations, as I said, in Europe alone, that, that are viable for us to deliver a minimum number of, orders. so, and then if you say, okay, from a strategy point of view, do you want a thin layer? That means then you have that incumbency, advantage in, in many markets at once or as fast as possible, or as you said, do you just own a handful of markets such that they're impenetrable and you don't share them with anyone? And we've seen that play out in food delivery, in the USA and then later on in Europe. We've seen the way it goes. Each market gets its own lead player. And then 10 years on, there's consolidation for efficiency reasons, mostly, and you end up with two or three players in the region, in the continent. And I think there's a potential where if we just stayed in the main European markets, that a smaller business will start up in Sweden and one in Spain or whatever, we'll and for us anyway, we don't want to let that happen. We want to go slightly thinner in more geography, early than going deep. And primarily because we learned from the previous two industry scooters and, food delivery, and you could argue mobility as well. So, on demand rides where if you leave a market alone, something will grow there, and then you're postponing a problem of either competition on economics or, competition on marketing and owning the customer, and I think it's better therefore it's not a black and white, but I think generally we would favor going wider and more shallow. That's a stronger position to be in.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:17:42\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">And just to make sure I understand when you say that shallower and wider, do you mean not saturating a metropolitan area with presence in every suburb, but, perhaps a few suburbs but you're not thinking that, okay, once I'm in one of those suburbs the shallowness will be a characteristic of the service that you offer such that the risk is that you disappoint customers when they go to the app and say, oh, okay, great. Thanks. I can't get the service. I'm disappointed. I'm deleting your app.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:13\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">it won't be the customers that will decide whether they're getting drone delivery or not. It'll be the aggregators and the vendors won't give them a choice because it's a lot cheaper for them to fulfill that order. So when we say shallow, in an area, it means we go to a large city we'll do all of the suburbs over 50 to a hundred thousand people, but the suburb that's only 25, 000 or less, they're not getting the service because we'd prefer to be growing to the other suburbs in Madrid and Berlin and Stockholm and so on\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:18:46\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Right.

Yes, correct. So yeah, you don't want to go into a suburb and have a inferior product to what the aggregators themselves have and the aggregators themselves will want you, us, to be able to power most of their choice, some of their choice is impossible to power. You've got these real, tiny little restaurants tucked away in corners. And there's just, you're not going to get an aircraft there, but we'd like to think the 60th or 70th percentile of volume, we'd be able to get, and that in terms of volume of, or choice translates to less than 50 percent of choice. or percentage of restaurants in the area that you'd need to care about. But don't forget it. Go back to coffee. If all we ran was a coffee delivery business, we'd be a gigantic business and that would be a lot easier to fulfill than takeaway food.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:19:45\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, if you, as knowledgeable as you are, your background in aviation, your success in aviation. And as you think about advanced air mobility overall, let's say we break it down to a couple of different buckets. Let's say military drones, let's say commercial drone delivery, whether it be coffee, medical or the like. Or three, let's call it eVTOL, STOL let's say those are three big segments of AAM. What excites you and let's say you were an investor and you had to invest your money. I will assume you will say commercial coffee drone delivery will be an early candidate for investment. What would be next and what would be last?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:20:24\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">My next, without a doubt, in fact, if I wasn't doing this now or I wanted to do something new, it'd be military, defense, look at Anduril or Look at the geopolitical landscape right now and there's a race for sure to arm countries defensively with technology and that technology without a doubt is going to come in the form of flying robots largely, and that's going to have myriad sensor tech, software. It's a software play more than a hardware one. There's obviously a fusing of them, but I find that a really interesting space. And I think, the world is going to be investing a ton of capital in there and the opportunities are enormous and I'm probably unusual in that. I think that's a good thing that industry thrives because it's actually a way to reduce war, not increase war. So that's what I would be doing and I'd be doing it from the USA. cause I think that's where most of the investment's going to happen. So yeah, that's what I would be doing. I wouldn't bet on passenger mobility for a while. I just think it's too hard. I just don't think the physics work well enough yet, and the economics are, I find them difficult to see. You know, they work and it'd be interesting for sure, but I would, I'd be investing in, and working in military defense tech before I'd be doing that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Jim:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:21:43\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">As you think about aviation technology, as you think about advanced air mobility, who are the thought leaders out there that you listen to?

I think Adam Woodworth in Wing is an amazing guy. I met him last year. What they've achieved is remarkable. And closer to home, my own team, I have Siggy Zerweckh, 25 years in General Atomics that just, oozes aviation engineering. I'm wowed by the engineers, so you can probably hear that. And thought leadership in the space for me, more important than those, engineering visionary types that I mentioned are the ones that actually understand business as well. And there I'm afraid the industry is guilty of not being real from a business sense, but I have to say, it would be for me, Google and what they've achieved and drone delivery is who I would hold up in the highest regard. And thought leaders, most of your guests, I think, if I look back, you've done a good job of choosing them and I find them really every time I'm surprised, I've never heard of this person. And then suddenly I've met, somebody that's really understands the space better than I could have imagined. So, so many choices.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Peter:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:14\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">One thing I think might be interesting to explore are your thoughts on, the capital that is going to fund the scale out of drone delivery. Right now, it has been primarily funded by venture capital, but clearly there are other types of investors that are going to step in and fund the scale out and thinking about, from your vantage point, who are they, what are the things that they want to see and then what will the financing of the scale out likely look like?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:23:47\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Yeah. So I think for who's going to pay to scale it out and what, how does the industry, get the capital it needs to really grow at its natural ability. The numbers are gigantic, right? There's probably a couple of hundred thousand, half a million aircraft are going to be needed in the next five to 10 years, maybe more, maybe less. These are big numbers, in terms of cash needs. I do though, think that the industry lends itself well to venture. We're certainly backed by venture, and we would foresee quite a bit of our future growth. So for us, we'll grow with a blend of debt and venture because we throw off cash now, remarkable as that sounds, we generate cash in a location. So we see ourselves as being probably 60, 70 percent debt funded. So think asset financing type growth and then equity is the other part and private capital for that. So venture. There's an argument that might say, private equity could get there as well. Large private equity firms could get there too. But our ambition is to take the business public as soon as we can. That is a moving feast because public markets are, not in great shape, but by the time we get to that 50 to a hundred million run rate revenue, I think the right thing to do for a business like ours is going to be to IPO because of the profile of investor that's available there. The retail investor will be very important to us as well. The amount of capital we will need to raise to grow it, as I said, to be the leader is enormous. And so it's our ambition to float the company as quickly as we physically can. But I don't think that's in the next two years. It's probably from three years onwards, but there's, there is an outcome where we're floating this business in three years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:37\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Bobby, as we wrap up, what are some of the things that you'd like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Bobby:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:25:41\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">I think the most important thing is the audience to understand that the economics have now been proven for this space. The viability of it has been proven very clearly, that this works, that it is better than the alternative in terms of just the economic aspect of it. That's, that is the most important takeaway here because there still remains a lot of doubt about that. And I, I think. There has not been a focus of it. I think we're probably the only company that speak about unit economics, costs, traditional business things. We don't talk so much about our aircraft. We don't do any cool videos of our aircraft because it's not what it's about to us. So the takeaway is focus on the economics and that is what's going to make the difference between winning and losing in this space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Luka:\u003C/strong>\u003Cspan style=\"color: rgb(21, 30, 27); font-size: 16px\"> \u003C/span>1:26:32\u003C/p>\u003Cp style=\"text-align: start\">Excellent.

This technology of distributed electric propulsion systems and advanced flight control systems is revolutionary. And we must apply the evolutionary learnings that we have had over the last 120 years. And by doing so, in the thesis I lay out, you're helping to ground that base and think about, okay, let's not just run down the hill. Let's walk and make sure that we can cover all the aspects that we need to cover. Our air transportation industry is the safest mode of transportation in the world. And yet we still have some certainly surprises that occur in aviation safety and in the design of the vehicles, in the control systems. We've all seen them in recent times. And here, these are processes and aircraft that have been around for quite some time. So I just want to make sure that we stay grounded in that we don't just accept the fact that we've got this new technology and it's going to just work immediately and be safe because it's new tech. We've got to go through the processes and procedures and time, of use to bring this to a scalable solution for transportation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Welcome to a much anticipated return of David Stepanek, Executive Vice President, Chief Transformation Officer of Bristow. Few can offer a more seasoned, measured, practiced, realistic view of where advanced air mobility has been, is, and perhaps where it's going. For those who have taken a careful, realistic approach to advanced air mobility, this discussion is a confirmation of your smart approach. We've been so eager to have guests back for a second conversation. Because the earlier impressions and assumptions mature over time. And in some cases they hold true and in others, they evolve. Hearing how things have changed can be of great value to our listeners, OEMs, operators, as well as investors. We're particularly fortunate that David and team have taken the time to write A Philosophical Guide For Early Operations. As they have put their thoughts on paper, on how advanced air mobility should be carefully and properly deployed. David and Bristow have been early adopters, buyers, and implementers of the advanced air mobility so their initial and subsequent assumptions and realized outcomes, carry great weight. As David mentioned often throughout the guide in our talk, he believes that those who have experience in vertical flight and being experienced operators, have a particular edge in evaluating, deploying, and scaling advanced air mobility. So listen to David's summary of the guide his five point thesis and general observations, his discussion of health management and flight operational data to enhance and optimize safety, and David's thoughts on what early advanced air mobility assumptions have proved out according to plan and what has changed from what some had thought just a few years ago. Given how precient David and team were just a few years ago, perhaps we'll listen even more and how he views the future of advanced air mobility as well as its risks and opportunities. Additionally, perhaps we even be a bit more critical and circumspect of those who have an interesting idea, but don't really know how, or don't have experience in bringing tech to the aviation market. Many thanks to David for his return visit and an important and engaging discussion and to our guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with David Stepanek as you innovate and generate positive financial returns in The Vertical Space. David Stepanek became Bristow's Executive Vice President Chief Transformation Officer in March, 2021. In this role David is leading the transformation of Bristow by introducing the next generation of advanced air mobility aircraft and expanding Bristow's core business in new regions. Through David's efforts Bristow has forged strategic relationships with multiple advanced air mobility manufacturers, leveraging Bristow's 75 years of safety management and vertical lift operations. He participates in a variety of public speaking engagements related to advanced air mobility operationalization and overcoming the hype of advanced air mobility to bring it to reality. David previously served as Bristow's Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer responsible for Bristow's global operations, supply chain, and IT. Prior to joining Bristow, David held positions with PHI, including President of PHI's energy business, and PHI Americas. David started new carrier businesses for a Phi in Australia, Cyprus, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad. He also led PHI's acquisition of Helicopters New Zealand in 2017. He has held board positions with Cougar Helicopters and HeliOffshore the global safety focus association for the offshore helicopter industry. David spent 20 years at Sikorsky aircraft in a variety of leadership positions. Including technical support customer service and commercial sales. During this time with Sikorsky David sold and delivered the first commercial S-92 model helicopter and booked over a billion in commercial helicopter sales. David is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Hey, David, welcome again to The Vertical Space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My pleasure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay, David. So we're going to ask the same question as we did the beginning of the last podcast, as we do all podcasts. What, is something that very few in the industry agree with you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A majority of the folks in this industry, the companies in this industry don't agree with me that really cargo is the way to move first. And that pragmatic approach to it. And that's driven by business models that have been, The activity levels that have to happen in order to infer some of the, returns that their investors are going to expect. So they're moving forward with, more of a urban mobility or transportation model, in and around the cities. Notably, what's potentially gonna be happening with, in the Middle East, in the United Arab Emirate with several of the different, OEMs that are vertically integrated. And then also the, the potential with, airline transfers in the New York region first. So, I want them to be successful. I do. I, I think they're going to be faced with certain challenges, but for Bristow and for, I think the vast majority of the theses that we've laid out is that cargo transportation will, in a business to business model, is the approach early to allow us to scale to, the different, unique business models of, of both regional mobility and urban mobility. As we, transfer, through the next, next five to 10 years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, how is that controversial? I think a lot of people that I speak with would say cargo is likely to be one of the first. How would well-informed people disagree with you?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's the numbers of aircraft and the volume it's going to be relative to the top line, of the, of the company where cargo transportation can be smaller and profitable, but it won't drive the higher levels of revenue that has been expressed in, a number of different business models.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So David you are the first to return as a Vertical Space podcast guest. And there's a couple of reasons that, you are the first person to return. One is to discuss your new guide, The Philosophical Guide for Early Advanced Air Mobility Operations. And number two, let's face it, there are not many people who have led the community like you have with, with partnering with an awful lot of very prestigious organizations who are, leading the way in advanced air mobility. So, to be able to hear your thoughts expressed in the guide, but also expressed in, what you've seen over the last couple of years and what's changed. That's probably one of the most important thing is what's changed. So if you could just give us a little bit of an overview of the guide, an executive summary, because everybody should read it, but give us an executive summary of the guide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll do my best. First, I think I should probably outline why I decided to write the guide. it's somewhat unique in doing so, and when I was talking to some of the executives within Bristow while I was doing this, First of all, they were like, what are you doing here? are we going to lean into some of our intellectual property? Are we going to tell people exactly what to do and generate more competition? My response is that our stated vision is to be a leader in innovative and sustainable vertical flight solutions. And, and being a leader really means rising other people up as well and, being part of the process. So our core competencies is one of the values that we believe that Bristow brings to the advanced mobility space. And without divulging some of the secret sauces that we use to, to manage our core competencies, I wanted to express the philosophies that we use and that we've learned over the 75 years of operating helicopters and airplanes to this industry and why. And so that was That was part of it. The other is I outlined some observations that I've made and those are concerns. So there's these observations that I've made that are outlined in the guide, and I wanted to express that and, and then offer some potential solutions or at least thoughts on, on solutions. And the third part is really intersected the, the other two to be the impetus to get me to write down this was, I work with an executive coach I have for a decade, and I was discussing with him the thoughts that what we're doing, the thoughts, some of the challenges that I'm, we're, we're facing, some of the frustrations that I have in trying to, to relay the messaging that I want to get across in a very short time period, generally that we have with, whether we're working with governments or business people or investors, you get 15 or 20 minutes. It's hard to get a very complex. thought process or complex philosophy across in that. And he said, well, you're basically writing the book on this. And then he went, that's what you should do. You should write the book. So, I laughed and said, I'm a busy man. I don't have time necessarily to, write something that needs, that's as complex as this, and that would be as in detailed. He encouraged me to use a ghostwriter and I thought about that a little bit further. One of the things that I like to do when I'm on holiday or go on very long, multi day, hikes. So last summer I was on a hike in Spain and I had a few days to really think about it. And I put the outline in my brain and jotted it down and decided to write it myself over the Christmas holidays. And so those were the three real factors there. And then I wanted to lean on people that I work with and people that I've talked to, people that I respect that have maybe a different, viewpoint of whether it's aircraft certification or government relations or the real technical aspects of the advanced mobility space. So I leaned on a lot of people, three I mentioned as contributing editors, and, and they, they had a, real big input to, what you, you finally got to read. Richard Lapin is an expert in government relations and international relations. And he's worked with various governments around the world. Marc Poland is an old colleague of mine. He retired from Sikorsky a number of years ago. He was one of the first, if not the first program manager on the S-92 and brought that aircraft through certification and launch of commercialization. And then, Dr. James Wang, the professor at a university in Singapore, he built the first tilt rotor, eVTOL aircraft, Project Zero in 2011, which he showed me back then. So I was able to really lean on them and bring some of their concepts and ideas and thought processes in. And I felt like once we had it written in a draft format, it was something that a lot of people could utilize. And I didn't write it for technical experts and I didn't write it for the, necessarily the people that are deeply involved in advanced mobility, but this ecosystem is going to be very large. There are going to be a lot of people that have never worked in air transportation or transportation in general. There are going to be a lot of investors that are going to be thinking about coming into this space. Because the total available market is substantial and it's going to spread across the globe. There's be a number of hundreds of different companies that are going to start up. So the thought is we've got this great philosophy about how to bring aircraft into service and the things you need to think about specifically in vertical aviation. And hence I jotted it all down and it's really 40 years of, my experience and others.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As you read the guide, you can hear a couple of themes that are loud and clear. One is there was a lot of exuberance early on, and there was a lot of promise early on. And that, in some ways, your guide is a de risking. guide, isn't it? Here's a way to de risk your investment. Here's a way to de risk if you're an OEM. So give us a couple of the areas that you think somebody reading the guide would perhaps think differently than where they are today. Whether they be the OEM or whether they be an operator. Whether they be experienced in vertical lift or not.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, one of the things I hope to get across in this was that once these aircraft are type certified by an airworthiness regulator. That that's not the end. We don't just, now we have an aircraft that's certified and produced. It goes to a dealership or it goes into the market. And we just turn them on. Like we do an automobile. To operate these aircraft for hire, for service, or to provide service to, the public or governments, you're an airline, so recognize that, and that stems from, I presented it to, Smart Cities Conference a couple of years ago. And these are mega cities, very, very smart people that driving city planning with tens of millions of people in population with lots of different, infrastructure and logistics issues to deal with. And one of the comments that they came up with was that, this is just like buying an electric scooter or an electric car, I'm just going to put it into service and when I explained to them what's necessary to do that, it's, you're an airline and you have to abide by the rules. By, by the rules and regulations that drive the, the air transportation system. So that's one. The other is that it's not easy. So being an air carrier is not just I buy the best stuff or the best aircraft and I put it into service and I hired it. There's so much more that goes into the thought processes of, not just which aircraft you buy, but how you configure it for its purpose. What are the process and procedures that you're going to utilize for the missions that you've outlined for your business plan? And how do you impart your culture of safety throughout the entire organization? So that's a very difficult process. It's relatively easy to buy an aircraft. Takes capital. A lot of people can raise capital. It's a little harder, right? Process and procedures, but you can hire some of that too. So you can hire some experts and you can get a lot of things just right off the shelf. The hard bit is having a culture that, it's a very top of the leadership, which I believe in, most, if not all cases, leaders of organizations want everybody in their organization to be safe. How you manage that and how you make that happen is a little bit more difficult than just wanting it. So you've got to be, you've got to have it in your DNA. You've got to have it in the way that you lead, the way you present yourself and the rest of the leadership team throughout the organization. Cause at the top people want to be safe, leadership wants to be safe, and at the line level, they're the ones that are executing, they're the ones that are going to cut their fingers, they're the ones that are going to trip and fall, they're the ones that are going to get hurt. They obviously want to be safe too. It's in the middle where you have this drive. So if you could see like an hourglass where you're driving people for execution, you're driving people for profitability, you're driving people to meet schedules, How do you make sure that they're imparting the philosophies and beliefs of that company? That's the hard bit. So it's not just I snap my fingers, I buy an aircraft, I get an air operating certificate and I'm ready to go. There's so much more to it, and I believe, and what I impart in this philosophical guide, is that companies like Bristow, not necessarily has to be Bristow, but companies that have this experience over the years and have done it over time, can put these aircraft into service in a very limited case and share the information of operational inefficiencies or data or technical problems with the industry to help improve the safety. At the same time, we're demonstrating to the regulator, safe, efficient operations that will allow the expansion of different, into different businesses. And hopefully at the same time, we're proving out to the public where there's been certainly some disarray, if you will, if you think about the, issues that, that Volocopter has been faced with in Paris and, really the citizens not wanting that to be operated during the Olympics or in the city at all. We can turn this into a more normal mode of transportation through that process. And that will allow investors and entrepreneurs to do either invest in companies or raise the capital necessary with the data that's been produced by these early operations to allow this expansion of the industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the topic of all the steps that an air carrier needs to go through in order to introduce a new type to their operations. In your guide, you mentioned that that can take between, 12 to 18 months. everything inclusive of training, supply chain planning, writing of the operating manuals, maintenance planning, et cetera, et cetera. To what extent can this be parallelized? Talk a little bit more how that integrates with the discussions that you're having with OEMs. And to what extent is this really a serial operation as opposed to parallel?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'll speak to it in two categories. One is if, we were buying a traditional aircraft that's already been type certified and in service, where that's very much a parallel operation. Say you decide to buy a new type of aircraft for your operation, they've produced it before. You're running the training organization. You're writing of the manuals. You have known performance to deal with. So you can write that in parallel with it. For an aircraft that's not yet been type certified, it's a little more challenging because there could be some constraints that appear before certification process. And there also could be some regulatory shifts or training shifts and how you're going to operate. So you try to run that in parallel as much as possible. One to align with the allocation of capital to buy the aircraft and two to speed up the, in service time, but it's, it, there's likely going to be a lag. So it's going to, run somewhat in parallel and somewhat in series, for the early adoption. And one of the things I mentioned in the document is, and this is from experience, early adopters with the wherewithal, with the financial capability to withstand and be resilient to certain aspects, the capital that's being employed, potentially with some alternative solutions in case there's a problem. We tend to have a little bit more patience with an OEM and a regulator when we're challenged with different problems, whether it's a technical problem, a regulatory problem, something that's cropped up in the operations. So you've got to be able to work within that whole process. And that can in part can actually slow training down. It could slow the aspect of staying current with that particular aircraft, if you have a gap in operations for a month or two. So all those things you'll have to deal within, the early operations side of things. So if you build a business model to just go out full throttle straight away, every aircraft flies every day, we're not going to have any issues. I mean, you're really setting yourself up for some disappointment and potential issues.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A good chunk of the document also covered your thoughts on early operations. Can we spend some time talking about how your current view on early operations has changed over the years and, how you see the evolution of these early markets?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So back to the pragmatic approach, that's why I want to do something in a constrained environment with business to business operation. Because one of the unique, aspects of these vehicles, specifically the 100 percent battery electric aircraft, that's certainly nothing that we have to deal with the traditionally powered aircraft is, will likely take off at maximum or close to maximum gross takeoff weight to get the most performance we can out of these vehicles. We're also going to land at maximum gross takeoff weight, whereas traditional aircraft will be landing at a lighter weight because you've burned off the fuel, all those things. So that means we're really putting the maximum stresses on the aircraft at both takeoff and landing. The business models and the range capabilities of these vehicles are going to require multiple takeoff and landings a day. And so we don't understand, surely, through the certification, there'll be analysis that's done and there'll be margins put on the structural integrity of it. But I do think that we'll likely see issues that will hopefully be rectifiable, that we'll have to deal with on the structural side of things. I relay back to experience with traditional helicopters. As I reflected, I couldn't think of one aircraft that we put in the service early that did not have some sort of, a structural issue that we had to deal with, whether it's sponsons and landing gears, or the frames around the primary drive system, engine mounts. You tend to have, higher use cases and higher vibration message in operations than you would in flight test. And you might not see them in flight test, you may not have predicted that these things could happen, but, but they tend to happen in these different environments. So having that temperate environment with, average temperatures, moderate humidity, not a lot of rain and thunder and lightning. Those early operations will allow for that testing and as, as we put them in harsher environments, we're going to see other issues that are going to crop up with these machines and how we deal with them and how we have the resilience and wherewithal to deal with them and ensure that we have a business model that can withstand, the financial challenges that are going to be faced with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Right. One of the things that stood out, part of your theses is that early operations should be over low population, low density, airspace type of geographies. And just to make the conversation a little bit more interesting and spicy here, I'm going to poke some holes, but, intuitively, intuitively, this makes sense. But at the same time, the regulator will not allow a new type to fly unless they are convinced that the aircraft is safe to be integrated into the national airspace system and safe to be flown over, whatever geography it is, approved to fly over. And so, to make an analogy when, when Boeing or Airbus introduce a new airplane, they don't have a restriction as to what airports they can be flown in and out of. Now, granted, those are systems that are well understood and we have decades of operational data to understand them. But at the same time, it just feels like this, constraint of early operations might impose some, economic penalties early in the use cases where those are needed the most.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I had a sense that this was going to raise some controversy. And the hypothesis is really around several different ideas, and it's not just about the concern over safety of that operation, the concern that you may have to land the aircraft in a, unplanned environment. That is part of it, but it's not all of it. The other part of our business model thesis is, that these vehicles early on should provide services and goods to services to areas that are in need of it, that have, poor road systems, poor transportation systems that need to have materials brought to them in a more efficient manner. So when I think about those environments, I'll give you a couple of examples. Scandinavia has geographical barriers, so you have a lot of fjords. You have great road systems, but they take lots of time to get to. You have some transportation on rail, but not a vast majority like you have in most of Central and Western Europe. And then there's places such as the northern territories of, Australia, there's places within continental United States that fit that as, as well, and, others. And, those also tend to be, and it may not seem intuitive, but the coastal areas of Scandinavia is somewhat temperate. We have very few icing days. It's close to our supply chain. So that was one of the reasons behind it is, is that we think that there's a really good economic business model for that particular mission, and it serves the purpose of isolating the system in case there is an issue, we can deal with it. So it wasn't just about trying to put a constraint around use case of these of these machines. It was really our philosophy that we had stated very early that we think is the is the right business case for it, whether it's the islands of Scotland or fjords of Norway or, pick another country that has similar characteristics. I think Japan's another really good example, even though you've got a great rail system, you've got a condensed population with very mountainous region with lots of, rugged coastline that, that needs to be supported.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you mind sharing maybe some details when you looked at some of these use cases, in terms of the size of this market opportunity, how that compares to the initial expectation of these aircraft being used for the commuter market, what's their relative size and, can OEMs really scale, as expected in those early use cases?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:08\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, the latter part of your point is I think important to note because the scaling is, I believe it's not going to be at the peak levels that, we're talking about early. So the production levels I believe they're not going to hit some of the early projections. It's going to be in the 25 to 100 to 150 aircraft per year until you scale new production and you have to distribute the production facilities globally, if you, plan to, penetrate those markets. So we've done, I gotta be careful what I say here. there's, there's a lot of work that's being done. A lot of it's being done under a non disclosure agreement. but what we're looking at for, for these different regions in Scandinavia is potentially up to 50 aircraft. in service over a two year period that can generate, you can do the same math that, that some of the SPACs have been, have done it on. There's potential two to two to three million revenue per aircraft in that space. Not all of them will work every day. It is a nice market. It is a market that potentially could provide very good returns to the operator and the other people that are in investors in that process and will provide, the necessary data for the scaling, both in production and implementation into different mobility factors, whether it's regional passenger carrying and, or, into the urban side of things. The other part of that aspect with this. early adoption of cargo transportation is you're utilizing existing infrastructure. So there's not, necessarily a requirement to go out and invest heavily in concrete. Or heavily in ground facilities. There will be investments that will be necessary in, the charging networks that'll have to be put in place. There'll be some other investments in there as well with ground handling equipment and tooling. But not to the scale of having to build a 25 or 30 million VertiPort and going through the whole process of the real estate investments that are necessary for it early on. If it works, if these aircraft are viable, safe, efficient, and reliable, that will provide the data for the investment thesis that are going to be necessary for the substantial amount of capital that's going to have to flow into the, investment of infrastructure, real estate development, air traffic management, communication systems, all the things that are necessary. And then the other reason for the remoteness side of it is many of the the big airports in the big cities, they're very close or at capacity. So you'll hear things from certain city planners or airport planners. It's like, Oh, great. We'd love to have UAM in here, but just don't add any more airplanes to my system. I can't handle it. Whereas in these remote locations, you've got airports that are screaming for help. That are, that want this, to come in so they can actually build out a process which should potentially create, create new\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>jobs. So, Dave, if we take this Scandinavian network as an example, what would you see the utilization of those 50 aircraft in that network being and how would it compare to what has been circulated in the community as to the urban air mobility or the airport transfer use case? How do those compare to each other and what are the pros and cons in your mind?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some of the work that is cargo movements are in belly cargo today. So they're somewhat constrained by whatever the capacity of the aircraft is, depending on how many passengers they're utilizing, and what the payload available is. And then of course the commercial schedule. And then the other aspect is you're replacing lorries and trucks, depending on which part of the world you're in. As far as, utilization goes so analysis is done. It's at this point in time, it's a guess, what are we going to get for reliability? What's the backup requirements? What's the maintenance schedule? We don't, know those information yet, if you look at it, a helicopter operation, the maximum utilization we tend to get on a per tail number or per serial number aircraft is about 90 percent. So you say you take a 12 hour day. 90 percent of the time, we can get a helicopter going. To get to a higher utilization, you have to employ more capital and have additional assets in place for backups. In the helicopter world, it's a much more intense amount of capital than you see in fixed wing aircraft. So you know, it's not, I think it's a, it's not unusual for a company, ultra, low cost carrier with hundreds of aircraft that maybe have three or four backups. I don't know what the big carriers carry. So to get to that rate will take more capital. And that's what we'll be planning in a certain number of technical backups to support maintenance operations and downtime for technical capabilities. And what we've learned in the helicopter operation is that with the proper amount of, technical backup, we can get up to 99 percent utilization rate. And then if that's measuring dispatch utilization, and then now you got to talk about what's the utilization of the payload capabilities, of the, of the asset,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And the number of flights\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>and the number of, number of, number of flights, then, and really that's going to be relative to the performance of the aircraft, the hazards which you need to mitigate. We're again, just building early schedules out, but we're, we're thinking about six hours of operation on a daily basis is, about the right way to start somewhere between six and eight hours. So you're taking into account whether you have to have additional crew, fatigue, risk management, the, turnaround time, what you have to download, if there's information to be downloaded, the charging side of things, there's six to eight hours of, of daily utilization should, should suffice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the absence of operational data, where do you find the basis to ground your assumptions as to the level of interest and how you prioritize these early use cases?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you want to go somewhat of a, the art of war, go where your enemy's not, or go where it's easy to penetrate, the market. So there are certain just jurisdictions in the world that are willing to, work with what they might call a sandbox operation to prove some of these theses out. So potentially taking aircraft, even in a pre certification role, in a limited case of scope, and doing actual commercial operations for it, so proving out that process. getting potentially some, PSO routes. And some other things, that could help support the, the economics of it. And then there's the sustainability aspect and then the potentially the economic aspect. And I think, sorry, go back to one of your first questions about what, other people don't agree, agree on is that, I, a lot of people are pushing the sustainability side and it's very important but the economic model and the cost structure of this has to work first. Otherwise, it's just, it's going to be a difficult process. So that's the grounding of it. So we're, I, I've spent a lot of time and my colleagues have spent a lot of time working with, within different networks, in government, working at different airport authorities, and different logistics companies and energy and industrial companies that are, are really keen to, to give this a try and, and see if it works. And that's why, again, back to the, earlier show, invest as little capital as possible, do it with an operation that has existing infrastructure to prove it out so we can scale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Do you feel that you've properly expressed your five point thesis? We've nibbled at it, but if you could just rattle off the five.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. So my five theses are that early stage AAM operations should focus on a business to business model, a commercial model, that support a logistics network that's potentially already in place, and that you do that within a 20 to 60 kilometer range. That's the first part. Second thesis is that advanced mobility commercial operations will be required to be conducted by a licensed air carrier. So you're effectively an airline and particularly in the early stages our thesis is that, that airline should have some experience in vertical lift and in safety management to be the most efficient to doing so. Third thesis is that early stage AAM operations are best conducted by companies experienced in purchasing and configuring aircraft for their intended uses. AAM manufacturers would be best advised to work with these companies to ensure that the, the product that they're developing is commercially viable and, and we'll be able to be used by the use cases. And, and, and, and the genesis of that thesis is that there'll be equipment and use cases that are necessary that don't necessarily be, need to be part of a type certification. So aircraft that are type certified don't necessarily have to have an enhanced ground proximity warning system or a TCAS. But they're certainly needed for fit for purpose for certain operations. And then fourth thesis is early AAM operations should be conducted by air carriers using existing infrastructure with a willingness to collaborate with potentially new companies in order to share data that is not necessarily commercial but operational and safety to allow the AAM business to scale on a global basis. And that fifth thesis is that air carriers involved in AAM operations should have the appropriate equipment. processes, programs, and people in place to manage both the health and flight data that we're going to derive from these vehicles. And that in part will also allow a shorter timescale to do some of these early testings that I philosophize around learning that process of having more data than we ever had on any other aircraft will allow us to crunch that data, aggregate it, and understand the health of the vehicle in a much faster pace. So I think that by utilizing that data, you could accelerate into different and newer commercial models that, will potentially substantiate some of the financial theses that have been put forth.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dave, so you lay out the rationale for these theses in the document, but if you were to sum it up for the audience, what is the theme running in the background through your thinking that led you to create these theses? I mean, it strikes me as an approach that is grounded in a more realistic, and experienced view of what operations are actually like, and brings that into the conversation. But, in your words, what are the underlying themes behind your conclusions that you create in these points?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>36:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, I want to say that, I'm absolutely optimistic about advanced air mobility and all the potential use cases of it. And I believe that optimism is a force multiplier. So I want to get that out, Chris, because there is certainly a grounding. And some people could see this as pessimistic, or some people could say this as, I have a poor view of some of the early operations that may occur outside of my thesis. So I'm very optimistic about it. But behind it is something that I talk about early on is we're at a revolutionary point in aerospace. This technology of distributed electric propulsion systems and advanced flight control systems is revolutionary. And we must apply the evolutionary learnings that we have had over the last 120 years. And by doing so, in the thesis I lay out, you're helping to ground that base and think about, okay, let's not just run down the hill. Let's walk and make sure that we can cover all the aspects that we need to cover. Our air transportation industry is the safest mode of transportation in the world. And yet we still have some certainly surprises that occur in, aviation safety and in the design of the vehicles, in the control systems. We've all seen them in recent times. And here, these are processes and aircraft that have been around for quite some time. So I just want to make sure that we stay grounded in that we don't just accept the fact that we've got this new technology and it's going to just work immediately and be safe because it's new tech. We've got to go through the processes and procedures and time, of use to bring this to a scalable solution for transportation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:19\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, in some ways, you're very blatant about it in your guide, but what you're basically saying is bringing technology to aviation is hard.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, that's super\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And for those of you who, I'm putting a little bit of a shameless plug in for our companies, because this is one of the things we understand, and this is how we help our customers. But it's hard. And for those of you who have not worked in bringing technology to market in aviation, there are so many hurdles that you can't anticipate. And just because you certified your plane, you have so many other things to consider. We all read what we want to read, right? But that really popped out from your guide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:55\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, thanks. I mean, that's, that's, that's really the, the gist of it. I, it is hard. What every one of these, entrepreneurs and designers and the OEMs are doing is super hard. Getting an aircraft to type certification is super hard, super expensive. And now you've got an aircraft type certified that you've been thinking about for five or six years and working on getting it designed. And then technology's advancing beyond your certification base. So you've got to work on catching that back up and this loop there. And then now you've got type certified. Now you've got to build it. You've got to build it in a manner that's reflective of the type certification in a repeatable way, in a high quality way which takes another couple hundred million dollars to build out a facility to get to the production levels that are going to be necessary for this to scale. And I think it's brilliant that many of these companies are leaning on automotive because I do think that that's what this is going to look like long term production. But building aircraft on automotive model, it's a different way of, of things. And I was sharing a story today with one of the OEMs, about an aircraft that's been in our, this aircraft, this is public information. We had an accident of a, of an aircraft two years ago, about a year and a half ago, actually. And, and what it was, was it was an installation defect that happened 11 years ago. The aircraft's been in service for 11 years and the defect finally materialized. And if not for the great coordination of our aircrew, it would have been a very catastrophic event. But the team was able to analyze what had occurred and manage the process and land the aircraft safely, albeit with a little bit of damage. So these are just, it's really hard stuff. And getting to repeat on a large scale of aircraft production, a helicopter manufacturer today on a very good year is doing maybe 50 to 60 aircraft a year. we're talking about that in a month now, or even more at scale. So how do you ensure that repetitiveness? How do you ensure that quality system throughout the hundreds of people that are going to, or, or even the people that be programming the robots to install it, all that's going to be a big challenge. So now you got to produce, and then you got to get it, get an airworthiness certificate on and get it to an operator or operate it yourself. Which also lends itself to a very difficult process. One, to convince yourself safe, efficient, reliable, convince your local regulator so you can get it on your operation specifications and ensure you have the aircraft fit for purpose to meet the mission and the environment that you want to run your commercial program on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay so based on these observations, what do you think about the aircraft OEMs that want to have that vertically integrated business model and also be the operator? What are the pros, cons, or implications of your observations on that path forward for a company?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:47\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's going to take a lot of capital. My first view, it's going to take a tremendous amount of capital, more capital than they would have if they were going to be a traditional OEM. And it's another step that's harder. So if you're a traditional OEM, you're part of two processes, potentially two processes, type certification, support of that type certificate and production. And now you're adding back in the third portion of, of the difficult processes of operating it and the complexities and the core competencies to operate and build are very, very different. I understand why some of the companies want to do it, specifically in the United States, and I believe that their business model makes sense to them, and I think they're going to be successful early on, and I want them to be successful early on. I've had discussions with both of them that are in a more vertical mode. Their success is going to hinge on a lot of the future successes of this industry because they'll be some of the early adopters. I do think it's a challenge to the business model and that they may have to, shift some of their thinking. And I think you're seeing some of that with each of them doing more international sales and partnering with a variety of different organizations. But in the other cases, you're somewhat of an homogenous society, if you think about it in that way, where you're the entire ecosystem and you have control of that, but you're also the entire ecosystem when something goes wrong your complete economic model shuts down no matter where you are in that process. So if you have a technical problem that you have to deal with over a certain period of times, both your production is in disarray or could be, in jeopardy and you're not flying, so you're not collecting any revenue at all. And there's no alternative for you because you don't have different, sources of, transportation. Whereas traditional operators such as ours, one of the reasons we have a variety of different partnerships with the OEMs is, it's our experience that we will have technical problems and we will need to use alternative aircraft that may not be the most fit for one when there's other problems with those vehicles. So, there's certainly that risk associated with it. That's what I see, but I, again, I do think that they've raised enough capital and that they can get through this process and get the aircraft into their operation. And I understand their process of doing so. And there's an argument that controlling the whole ecosystem under one management team could be safer and you're controlling your brand in a better way. So I understand that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And also vertically integrating at this stage of the life of this new market gives you the opportunity to learn faster and absorb the lessons learned from operations into your next generation of aircraft\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>precisely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:22\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>iterations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah.

I'm sure that somebody reading the guide might say, look, this really sounds like an incumbent that is trying to protect their position when faced with a wave of new entrants, right? Because, throughout the document, there are hints at how only current established air carriers have the, experience and the wherewithal and the competencies to pull this off and introduce these new aircraft. And so one thing that stood out as I was reading it is your comment that no matter how dedicated to the concept of mission, a company cannot set policies and fully understand and manage the risk and assurance of running air operations. This is a quote, without the experience that comes from being an air carrier. So what does that say about the landscape of emerging air carriers? Are you making a statement that all the future air carriers for these vehicles already exist today? Is it reasonable entrants? How's that going to play out?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>45:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Absolutely reasonable and expected and required because we can't all operate. across the globe. So you're a regional air carrier. Bristow itself is a global regional air carrier. We operate in 17 countries, 17 is all right. There's a lot more countries in the world than 17 where they'll have all their own regulations. They're going to need their own startup companies. They're going to need their own processes and procedures to do this. My thesis is that they can learn from us and we are willing to share that information. and collaborate to allow this to scale globally. The thesis is we think that it's best to start with us and this information can be discriminated quickly because we'll have so much data from the health of the aircraft and the flight data, and potentially some of the business constraints that we'll have to deal with, to allow that, that scaling, on a global basis. So that's why I say in one of the theses they must be willing to collaborate. So this is really a thing. We want to be a leader. We want to be a leader because we want a great business. We also want to be a leader because we think this is necessary for the sustainability of transportation, it's necessary for this new revolution of, of aerospace and technologies that are being applied. We think that we start with these eVTOLs, we start with these eSTOLs, and that the propulsion systems and the power systems and, the energy sources are going to get us to a point where this is a much broader transportation network. We can put it on a larger equipment, potentially even, transatlantic flights someday or transpacific intercontinental flight someday. So the, it starts here and companies like ours with that experience can help get that started. That's, that's the thesis behind it. And there's plenty of really great people out there that have that experience that can move around the companies or could come in and help with that technology for those startups as well. That it's not just that you have to be the company, but that team that you put together will need that experience or the lessons learned and we think that's one of our duties to this industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, as people have reviewed the guide for you before you published it, what's been some of the tougher questions they've asked you, or the challenges you've heard on the guide that you'd want to share with the audience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, we spent two weeks deciding whether a takeoff was a noun or an adjective with a preposition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you can imagine who that was with.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Alright.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, some of the review is exactly what some of the points that you've put out, specifically Luka that are you just trying to ring fence this business? I mean, this is going to be so large. The total market If successful early is massive. And there's no way that we would even want to ring fence that. So we, we think we can create our business on our attributes and that we think that we should help things. So there was that concern of the ring fencing. There was a tremendous amount of debate about, I did use some stronger languages in some of the early drafts about should or must. Or shall and must. so that, some of that, that came out. we got a little bit more detailed in the types of advanced air mobility aircraft, laying that out. I was a little concerned about being too technical. And then there's been a really great reception of the portions on safety management and data collection and how it's aggregated. I had a fireside chat at the Revolution Aero conference today. There was quite a few questions about what the data should look like. Who owns it? How does it work? How would you manage it? And I, my words were if an OEM or a major supplier that's managing the aircraft data doesn't want to share that information and aggregate it and work with the operators to ensure that we set appropriate thresholds, that we have algorithms to detect anomalies that we learn and that we have actions that come out of these measurements, that I'm, we're not really interested in, in working with those organizations. So back to collaboration. I think we, we all have to collaborate to get this started and get it going. Going as, as, as an ecosystem and a transportation network to, to allow it to grow, to really garnish the benefits that we all hope it can provide the world.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, real quickly on the aviation safety data.

And the epiphany I had on that, it was cause we're starting this organization, AAM Safety Consortium, is that Heli Offshore was founded in 2014. So we've been operating helicopters for 70 years, 60, 70 years. And we finally got around to putting a proper organization together to manage that. And speaking with the gentleman who runs Heli Offshore, and I was a former board member of Heli Offshore, if we had a chance to start at the very beginning, just imagine what we could have accomplished. So here's an opportunity. We have a clean sheet of paper. We have a very good template. And even, recently the Royal Aeronautical Society published a paper of kind of three issues that could potentially happen. They outlined pseudo accidents and what could occur, and they even mentioned the fact that having an organization such as Heli Offshore will help, mitigate, potential issues and accidents. That we have that information. Somebody has an information that needs to be shared because we're going to see different problems across the globe you'll have, and you may even see similar problems. For instance, somebody's an inspector's out there looking at an aircraft. They notice there's something wrong with the propeller. And it's delaminated, and it's delaminated in this section.

One, the numbers of aircraft will be substantially more. These are aircraft that are primarily going to be flown VFR, in low altitude space, so it's going to be having that assurance that the aircraft are being operated as the operation specifications and the company wants it to be operated in. I think it's going to have a greater impact on the industry. And then also it's interesting. You think about health and usage systems as a way to mitigate certain cost structures and improve the product reliability. but FOQA also comes into play here where you may see, even though it's, it's within the specifications of the aircraft or maybe within the operation specifications, you may see some use cases where you're wearing out wheels and brakes, and one base may be wearing out wheels and brakes at a higher pace than another. And when you look at FOQA, you can determine what's happening and potentially, mitigate that. So there's some, there's some really interesting, and this is an experience that I've had is there's some interesting economic benefits beyond just the assurance that the aircraft is being operated in a safe manner. And it's going to be also very important to play back into the training organization. And with the technologies we have today to replay in simulators and to replay in three dimensional models, it's going to help the new line pilots and the new engineers coming into play to learn some of the, lessons learned and see actual flights that have transpired, but it's also vital that FOQA is non punitive, unless there was a willful misconduct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, sure. David, given your guide, given you learned over the last couple of years, what would you have done differently at Bristow?

We are, I think, an early adopter, but on the scale of things, a lot was happening pre the merger of Bristow, so we really couldn't have done it. But there was quite a bit of work that had been done with the legacy, the pre merger era team. Mostly data collection and some discussion. So getting in earlier, maybe applying more human resources to it. We wanted to be very careful in, nascent business. We still, especially in 2021, weren't sure what's this was going to look like. It was a tremendous amount of capital flowing in. So I think applying a little bit more resource to it, I think would have, would have perhaps accelerated our processes. On the latter part of your question, I'm very pleased with all the companies that we've dealt with. It's difficult right now to say, because there's, there's really some other interesting products that are being developed and some interesting entrepreneurs that I just have to say to them, it's not you, it's me. We are at our capacity of our team. We're a very small team by design which allowed us to be somewhat flexible. So, having a little more resources could potentially have allowed us into different markets. The other aspect, and this was a question from the first discussion we had, because there was a lot of discussion about the drone market. Maybe entering or thinking about that a little bit more on a scaled basis. I still believe that for us to start a commercial drone business on our own is going to be difficult because of the nature of our cost structure and in the size of our business and the flexibility that small startups will have, they'll have the advantage there in the cost structure, but you know, working in a better way with, with some of the leaders in drones and cargo delivery on the drone side, I think would have been something that, but we're, we're somewhat into it now. There's been a partnership made with one of the, one of the big players that I'm really proud of. We're going to be doing some work with them, proving out certain operations and potentially doing concept of operations for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I'm glad you raised this because I was going to ask you how an organization like Bristow might think about using UAS of various payload capacities from a couple of hundred pounds to maybe a couple of tons even, to execute on the mission like you described in Scandinavia or Northern Australia, and thinking a little bit differently about, the movement of cargo in general, that's optimized, with these kinds of vehicles in mind that are cheaper to operate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Well, we certainly are thinking about that and that's in our portfolio with, Elroy Air Chaparral, you have a vehicle hybrid electric system, automatic loading and loading of the payload, the pod, capabilities of putting different payloads into the pod, including surveillance equipment and things that are necessary for coastal surveillance or whatever you happen to be doing and doing those operations, as you mentioned, in, in places like Australia, Alaska, Norway. There's a, an energy company in Norway that's been testing out some operations beyond visual line of sight long distance. They want a 200 kilo payload to support their energy, business to hot shot parts out. They've done the economic model. They understand what being able to get those parts in a fashion they can with a drone versus a helicopter or a boat, which is most cases they use, and they can increase the uptown of their rigs materially. We're talking millions of dollars a month of change of production earnings or, cost shutdown issues that they deal with. But that's actually absolutely our business thesis of using those size drones. For that, when I talked about, I was talking about the little one, little, littler ones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are those conversations like internally? What are the considerations when you think about adopting something that is a bit of a departure from your core competence? As you enter that gray zone, what are you comfortable, what do you fear the most? Shine some light, to our audience about those boardroom level discussions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So some are at the boardroom and some are really at the operational level. So as I mentioned earlier, we do operate, drones for His Majesty's Coast Guard, but that is a government organization. It's not a type certified aircraft. It's not a commercial license to do it because we can do it for public service. Operating a piloted aircraft, we do that, we understand it, we know how to do it, we've got licenses to do it. Going into a remotely piloted aircraft beyond visual line of sight, which we have core competencies in that business, but translating that into a commercial side is something that's not necessarily one of our core competencies. So what the fear is, what would it cost? What would it, how long would it take? Should we partner with, another organization that has some of those core competencies already and we could help some of the weaknesses that they may have, market access, working with energy companies, sort of things. Hence an early kind of discussion with one of them that's doing that. So that's a way to mitigate it. We're still going to be measuring whether we should do it ourselves, whether we need a separate, whatever jurisdiction we have in, do you have a separate operating certificate for that? Or do you put it onto your current commercial operating certificate? What are the risks associated? If you have a problem in the advanced air mobility side, how would it affect the traditional helicopter model? If you're on the same certificate, do we separate that? That's all the work that we're doing today, in terms of our roadmap to operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you look at that remotely piloted operation that you would be flying, how does it differ from the way the Department of Defense might be flying the same platform? I mean, you mentioned Elroy Air. Obviously, they're bringing forward a platform, for both markets, but when you really get close to it, are there some major differences that sort of rise to the level of gotchas for those companies? Or are you really laying out a path that is a consistent and scalable dual use path? Because obviously DoD right now is one of the most aggressive customers for this capability.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so my answer is going to be somewhat speculative because I'm not in depth on what DOD and Elroy are working on, other than I know they're in the AFWERX process. But I will say that operating an aircraft to an oil rig or to a platform, and working for an energy company, comes with a lot more responsibility, a lot more requirements that they would put on that I believe that the military wouldn't necessarily apply in the general operation processes. The requirements for mitigating liability, limitations of the liability, insurance processes, consequential damages. If you bang up an oil platform, that's producing 10, 000 barrels of oil a day. Do the math. That's a pretty heavy liability. So it comes with a tremendous amount more oversight and potential responsibilities for the,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>operator. And just for background, when you run an operation out to an oil rig, let's say in the Gulf of Mexico, is the entire flight within the NAS or, what portion of it would be outside?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If we're flying VFR, most of the proportion beyond line of sight of the coast is not within the NAS. ADS B out has helped us get more in, and we do quite a few more IFR flights where we're controlled. That's within the United States. So we actually have to control and set up communication networks offshore, to ensure we have, communication navigation systems. We also use satellite downlinks and uploads to know position of the aircraft on a repetitive basis. It repeats about every 10 to 15 seconds and then they'll have some push to talk capabilities there. So it's a bit of a mixed bag depending on the flight and the location and, and whether they're flying in IFR conditions or not.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I wanted to get your thoughts on how our audience should be thinking about the market size of the mission set that you are putting forward in this document as the lowest risk path for scaling up. I believe that it's big. There are billions of people living in remote areas that need things. And there are lots of different applications, but it's not as conceptually obvious to the broader audience in terms of the scale of that as compared to the story around UAM and the things that this industry has raised a lot of capital on over the last few years. So you're close to it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:04:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:04:01\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How do you communicate that?

So what markets are we in today and what is the size of that prize and what is our right to win it? So on a total available market, and I'm going to go to this analysis that was done by a very reputable firm, by 2035. we think on the cargo market size of, of it is approximately 60, 000 aircraft, potentially, total market globally, cargo, same basic numbers for both urban and regional mobility side of it. So, you're thinking about a potential market size of 120, 000 aircraft. 2035 and beyond, maybe that's getting pushed down a little bit further. For Bristow, and, and back to the theses here, because that was the basis, some of those theses were the basis of the work that we did to narrow that market down to, potential market for our company, and then what that size of the prize is and what's our right to win it. And then when we narrow it down to specific markets that meet our thesis. And this has been put in some of our public information and we've talked this with analysts. That is the industrial model, so working with our current industrial customers and potential some middle mile cargo transportation systems and logistics networks. The other part is pure regional mobility cargo transportation, supporting a network perhaps in Northern Europe and other places. And then the third is back to using our core competencies and white labeling for a large 121 carrier to provide airport transportation. So we see those as the initial markets and within the scope of our theses, of course, industry cargo first, then moving into the potential passenger markets. We think that for Bristow, on a top line basis, by 2030, 2031 is somewhere between, I gotta be careful what I say here, I don't know how to put any forward looking statements, but a sizable material market for the business. On hundreds of aircraft. I mean, it is public that we have placed orders for approximately 450 odd aircraft with the different, equipment manufacturers. We have put in capital now with some of those manufacturers, cause they've hit certain milestones in their processes. So we're on the road to doing that. We're looking at potential additional milestones met by this year. And we also believe that there's a potential that we could operate a small scale, electric aircraft, sometime this year or early next, and then potentially on the cargo side, early next year. Early aircraft in 2025.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:06:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, how has the market changed from two years ago?

Another thing that surprised me is I had expected more exits from the industry or consolidation. I was very pleased to see the Joby XWing consolidation. I'd like to potentially see more of that. There's just not enough capital that's going to be available for investment to meet this, the size of all the companies that are trying to enter into this market. So we're going to have to see that scale down. So I did expect more exits. I was somewhat surprised early on by Volocopter's, issue with the German government not being able to get the loan guarantees. I think that as the early investors, the SPACs have been done, the private equities coming, and it's not necessarily going to be there. You're going to need more government support, specifically the European companies. Whereas in the United States, I think that's the, Air Force program has helped really substantiate and validate the, equipment and provided a level of some revenue to support their operations. Those are the big surprises for me. I guess some people may say, are you not surprised by some of the delays in certification? I'm certainly not. We've built our models around potential aircraft moving out to the right. I also, and I said this today at Revolution Aero, it's not just the aircraft certification that's going to get delayed, but in my entire history of buying aircraft and delivering aircraft as a salesperson, I can't think of too many times we actually did it on time. There are always delays. People have robust schedules. They put them in place. So you have to build that resilience. So I'm certainly not surprised by the delays. I'm encouraged by it. I've also been encouraged by the latest, Advisor Circular that the FAA published recently, that aligns more with the EASA and gives some better direction on the vehicle certification and some of the other aspects of it. So not surprised, but very happy to see that. Really changes in the organization, no consolidation, no major exits to speak of, as surprised me for sure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:09:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What technology OEM operator has been the most significant positive surprise in the last year or so?

They are developing some vehicles, Lockheed is certainly, and Lockheed's an investor in a few others, but I've been surprised to not see them either make an acquisition and or announce a major development in this space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any change to advice you'd give to entrepreneurs that you gave, in your last podcast?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So I'd stick with picks and shovels. I would stick with that. I think that's still important. Make deals with, at this point in space, if you want to get into, into this space, I would, think about how you can be a supplier to the industry, the OEMs. And then a little later, well, in line with that, the drone deliveries and the beyond visual on a slide is accelerating. I think there's really good opportunities there for entrepreneurs that are willing to step into that space. And that's something I think you can do. And then others that are willing to maybe wait a little bit longer, infrastructure investment. Infrastructure in real estate, infrastructure in communication, navigation systems, in data processing and data aggregation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:10:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I know that you've listened to a lot of our podcasts.

I find it very informative and I always believe that you learn by listening to people that are smarter than you. And, everybody on, on your podcast generally smarter than me. my favorite is going to be John Langford. For personal reasons, one, I, I think that, one, he's within our portfolio and, one of the companies that we're really, hopeful for with Electra. Aero. Two, he's just a force of this industry with such a proven track record, and he's also influenced many of your other podcast people that have been on. They've either worked with him or worked for him within his team. And he's really spread his knowledge across the industry that, it's difficult to replicate and absolutely necessary. So I view as somebody that I would love to be able to emulate in any way, shape, or form. So hearing him speak about not what he's, just not what he's doing about this AAM industry, but is what he's doing potentially for STEM operations and his investments in things to get young people interested in aviation. I think it was just remarkable.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>David, thanks for being on, and good journeys back.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>David:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you.

If you do have the data and you want to run a one or half kilometer resolution model, it's going to take you computing resources, and that costs money and time, so you always have to worry, too, about turning these out fast enough. What good is a forecast if it comes out after the event. And the third one is the science. There's a reason why we can't forecast tornadoes perfectly, and there's still a lot of science. There's still a lot of things to learn. Even in icing, we have a lot of mysteries. So it's those three, but data is the key to improvement.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our conversation with Don Berchoff, CEO of TruWeather. So I was really looking forward to this conversation with Don. Because as he says, weather imposes uncertainty, and uncertainty costs money. We've known for years, the cost of weather on traditional aviation. And listen up to the kinds of numbers that Don shares as those costs and what percentage of those costs are considered preventable. This discussion is essentially about what's possible in weather. Don says that aviation has gotten used to the lack of weather data and it's gotten used to uncertainty and that there are ways to improve weather today and in the future. Improvements that could dramatically improve flight operations and reduced costs, according to Don. Listen to what a weather pro says about the three things most needed for a better forecast. And according to Don, how data is key to improvement. We get into a discussion of weather on smaller things that fly. Drones and eVTOLs and other vehicles in advanced air mobility. Now Don talks about the need for better low altitude and micro weather and the need for better data for micro weather. He says that with drones, there's approximately a 40 to 50% attrition rate due to weather. But here's the challenge. Even though everyone says they need better systems in this case, better weather systems how much are they really willing to pay for those systems? This is one of the great challenges of selling technology to aviation. And Luka and Peter really challenged Don here. They know advanced air mobility is really thin profit and margins. And questioned their willingness to pay for better weather. But as Don counters though, they can't afford not to have better weather. So take it all in and many thanks to Don for joining us and to our many guests, we hope you enjoy our talk with Don Berchoff as you innovate and The Vertical Space. Don Berchoff United States Air Force Retired is the co-founder and CEO of TruWeather with 40 years in aviation, logistics and weather industry solving, impactful weather problems for the government and businesses. Don built and led a regional weather center that supported worldwide tanker and airlift weather operations and the provision of weather warnings and forecasts at 138 Army and Air Force installations.

I think of my weather industry, which is, my home. And then I think of the, aviation industry, which is who we support and who I'm part of. The weather industry, I think, is in agreement with most of what we're going to talk about today, that there's a lack of low altitude weather data, that impacts predictions and that impacts uncertainty. I don't think anyone would argue with that. We might argue with how to close that gap and what's the right way to do it, but I think most people understand that gap. On the aviation side, the challenge that I've run into is most of your aviation folks who have been out there operating for lots of years have really gotten used to the lack of weather data. And they've kind of built it into their mindset or into their business model. So they're used to flying and dealing with the weather and overcoming uncertainty. And they really, sometimes they looked at me five years ago when I first entered this industry. And I said, this is going to be a challenge that for drones and air taxis, the lack of low altitude weather. And, they said, well, why are you trying to? You know, solve a problem that doesn't exist. That was actually quotes. And you know, it actually did exist, but they were used to it and they didn't understand what was possible. What I'm starting to see now is as folks are flying more in the industry, they're realizing, you know what, we're starting to see and understand the economics around weather data more than the safety component. You can always get around weather by not flying. And, we, we generally had about a 30%. of the time when manned aviation or crewed aviation didn't fly due to weather. They could have flown, but they didn't think of it that way. And so that's really where the mystery is going to get unlocked here. We're going to show them that you can, make more money with better weather data. We're going to show them you can reduce your risk. We can reduce your uncertainty. We can increase your passenger comfort. And you don't have to live with what you had because technology is changing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:10\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, why is there the difference between those who know weather and the aviation communities interface with weather? Why is there a difference?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>7:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It's a really good question. so I'm going to bifurcate the weather industry a little bit for you. You have those that are scientists folks that are actually in the business of producing forecasts. And they really do understand the things we're talking about. You need more data to make a better forecast. That sounds like common sense, right? But it really isn't as obvious to everyone as you might think even in the weather industry, because we have, the business side of weather. And the business side of weather, came out of really the 1980s and 90s. You know, the government had been the monopoly in weather and it had to be. There was really no options. And what weather companies did initially is they would take that government data and they customize it or make it much more impactful to a decision. In the beginning we didn't really change the forecast. Other than the human would look at the data and have this interpretive skill and heuristics that they can make it better. And that was the customized weather. People paid for that because it was better than the forecast. But then we started adding more data, right? We started getting satellites up there that were commercial satellites. We've added more weather instruments that are, privatized. we have more commercial data. but the business model has always been, and still is, focused on taking data, through apps and advertising, right? So advertisement, I always consider in the weather industry, we have a conflict of interest. The conflict of interest is, if you're in the business of providing data on apps and you're selling advertising, you have a motivation to have people click your apps more, which means now you want to, make data more hyper exciting, right? And then you have the customized piece, which isn't scalable unless you change the technology, around it, which is what TrueWeather's doing. And we have folks that like the current business model. And they don't want to admit that there's a lack of data, because if they do, it says we have to change the business model, which would disrupt the weather business models that depend on apps and button clicks and just forecast or customize data. So there's that middle piece there. So I'm bifurcating, a little bit. Now aviation, I think the challenge is weather's very complex. And, you know, when I was in the Air Force, I was on Air Force bases with F 16 pilots trapped at Kunsan, they didn't want to hear about my excuses about weather. They just want to know why weren't you right? Right. And, there's a tendency to try to simplify this whole process so they can make a decision that they feel comfortable with. And I think, you know, when you start explaining that you could do more with this data or that data, what I've seen in the industry is that they worry about having to pay for the data now. See, they like free data and the problem is free data is not free because it costs money. So to go back to, the edict here, in 1998, the cost of, weather delays by major airlines on the U. S. economy was 41 billion a year. And this is lost productivity, this is, decisions that cost money, it's inconvenience to customers and clients, that number is much bigger today. And to try to explain to the aviation community that's been built in the current system that there's an economic argument to be made, they don't really see it because they're not worried about the bottom line as much as the CFO is of a company.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The cost of weather delays, the 40 odd billion per year, how much of that is due to low altitude weather?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This study I'm talking about was a 1998 Boeing study that said that they actually said the 41 billion dollars was the cost of weather on the U. S. economy due to delays by the aviation industry. This is what got my attention, they said 28 billion was avoidable. That was the, that's what got me interested in this problem. Because that told me that even back then it was the way decisions were being made that was also causing some of this uncertainty that led to, you know, this 28 billion. So now if you look at today and based on what I've learned through my work in the Air Force and studies that I've done that have been validated, 30%, roughly 30 percent of, I, I think is recoverable, and the percentage of that due to low altitude weather, you have to bifurcate it down now and say, okay, that's general aviation, because remember, big aircraft don't fly at low altitude, right? They come into airports, they're well instrumented. So you gotta look at this and say, who's impacted by it? It's helicopter pilots, it's general aviations, and now it's gonna be drones and air taxis. And what I'm seeing right now based on, I can't really talk about specifics, but we're getting about a 40-50 percent weather attrition rate, meaning cancellation rate right now for some low altitude operations that are happening with drones. And my estimate is about half of that is due to lack of low altitude weather. And about half of that's due to just decision systems that aren't able to take this data and present it in ways that help to make a better decision, right? I don't want to get into those details, but that's about the way I see it right now.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, I'd love to uncover a little bit more of this because it's intriguing your comment about how there is perhaps still pushback from the aviation side that, solving for this low altitude weather is, not really worth the effort, right? Yet the impact is monetizable, some of the studies that you quote. And so is that because really where the money is, the weather is not as big of a factor on the low level, But the majority of the impact then becomes on GA and yet this is an area right now where the cost of not flying is not as high, because if you're a GA pilot, you look out the window and you decide that you won't fly because of weather and it's not like there is an economic impact as a result of it for the most part, right? So can we maybe dissect this business problem a little bit more with some examples and some additional feedback and commentary that you're hearing?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sure. So, let's take the helicopters, for example, right? If you talk to Rex Alexander, who is a significant advocate within the helicopter community, who also is trying to work with, you know, Oh, good. So, yeah, so Rex and I, you know, we have these conversations all the time. He's worked very hard to increase the ability of the, emergency helicopter HEMS, right, Helicopter Emergency Management Services, to improve their, readiness and their ability to respond, and do that in a way to try to improve weather information through a system that has been developed by, I think, NCAR and the National Weather Service have developed a system by which they try to better pull together the data we do have and try to better inform whether a helicopter should take a mission or not. Because remember, if there's an accident on a highway and you know, you have to decide whether you're going to send an airlift out there or you're going to bring an ambulance out there what you want to make sure is that if you're going to send that helicopter, it could get to where it has to go. And many times they will not take a mission because, remember, most flying helicopters does not occur at an airport. The airport's the only place that we measure weather right now. You don't get the measurements between airports. People don't understand, like, cloud height, visibility, measurements only happen at airports. That means 97 percent of the country, you have no measurements. There's no measurements. Satellite can't do it. There's nothing. Same with winds. Winds only get measured at airports when aircraft land, or with two balloon launches a day. We have a vast, desert of data below 5, 000 feet. The satellites get down to about 5, 000 and then they attenuate. There's some that get through, but it's not really relevant. This micro weather problem is the problem. We have always known it is a problem. There was a study done from the ground up. This was developed in 2008 by the National Academies that said we needed 400 profilers around the country to measure what we call the boundary layer up to 5, 000 feet on a regular basis, right, to get this sensor data so we can improve our modeling. So the helicopters may have to go to a hospital somewhere in the middle of an urban canyon that doesn't have even, it only has a windsock. There's no digital information and if there's fog or stratus they have to fly VFR. You just don't know if you can do it because we don't have data. So they'll drop that mission. They'll say, we can't take it and it could risk a life. And so they send an ambulance out. So that's an example of just one use case, but that magnifies itself across the board, right? Into both public safety, emergency response, and business, because we haven't talked about the business side yet of not flying that helicopter to the helicopter company or the hospital. That's just an example.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What other industry is more dependent on good weather than aviation?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a really good question. I would say it depends on how you define good weather, right? If you're a farmer, you want rain. That's good weather, right? If you're a renewable energy farm, you want winds. That's good weather, right? But it may not be good for your picnic. So, I always say it's the use case that drives that question. Now, you're talking about a really nice day where that's probably tourism, Because, you know, people want to go to the beach.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>How about the ability to predict weather accurately, whether it be good or bad? What industry is more dependent on that, or is more affected by it? You just said there's a 40 billion study on cost and delays and cancellations. That's a significant cost to the industry. What other industry is more affected?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I'm gonna blow your mind now. In 2017, the cost of weather on the US economy was 634 billion a year. And that covers agriculture, renewable energy, construction, logistics, transportation. These are all industries that are affected by weather, and they all need micro weather, by the way. But the challenge has been is we haven't been able to build the business case to close these gaps, to collect that micro weather, because these industries, there's no real coalition. The other problem is the government can't afford to put that out, that infrastructure. I was a science and technology director at the weather service for four years. I had a 130 million budget, and I learned pretty quickly that the money that we're spending on infrastructure in the government has to be on strategic infrastructure, such as satellites and things of that sort. And we have gotten much better at long range forecasting because of satellites. But when it gets to the microweather, we haven't really invested in that. And so that's like the nearest target, but yet the hardest to solve because of the resources. So if you think about it, agriculture can use microweather, renewable energy, right? They want if, you know, every time winds are off by one or two knots from the forecast, the renewable energy farm could be hit with millions and millions of dollars because they think they're going to generate a certain amount of power. They've got a contract to generate that power, and they may have to go to the spot market now to buy fossil fuels to make up for the difference they're losing. And that costs them lots of money.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>18:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Don, this deficiency microweather out weather that you talk about is it really a statement that we need more weather observations, in order to have a better picture of micro weather or do we have enough input data and the answer is somewhere else in this chain?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you talk to folks that are trying to demonstrate that they are developing a micro weather forecast because it is a requirement, and people do need it. They're using techniques that downscale models, but not adding new data below 5, 000 feet. Just so you understand, the global models are like 9km resolution right now. That's the best. That's European. It means that every grid space is 9x9km, which means everything in that grid space looks the same. You're not resolving anything in that other than the average. Our short range models in the United States are three kilometer resolution, which is probably like a mile and three quarters or two miles. Those are in those grids you're not resolving anything below that. So if you try to continue to drive that resolution higher by getting down to one kilometer by one kilometer or 500 meters, you're not adding new data into the set. you're just, all you're doing is you're making it look better. You're making the pictures look really better, but it doesn't mean the data is accurate. You need real data just like anything else. You have to have data in order to do improvements to forecasts. There's also modeling. The modeling has to get better. There's physics and then the computing. So the three things that make a better forecast are data, computing, because you need speed. If you want to, if you do have the data and you want to run a one or half kilometer resolution model, it's going to take you computing resources, and that costs money and time, so you always have to worry, too, about turning these out fast enough. What good is a forecast if it comes out after the event. And the third one is the science. I mean, we're not, there's a reason why we can't forecast tornadoes perfectly, and there's still a lot of science. There's still a lot of things to learn. Even in icing, we have a lot of mysteries. So it's those three, but data is the key to improvement. You can't do machine learning without data. What I'm seeing in the industry is people are doing machine learning, but they're using analysis data. So the way we do historical weather in the weather community we don't have data everywhere, so you have to build a grid. You have to take the data you have, and then you build a grid, and you match that up against your physical models, and then you estimate what you think is happening in between those, and then you get a grid of historical data. But guess what? That's not real data. And people are using that kind of historical grid today, which is 15 kilometers or more resolution to run machine learning. And after they run the machine learning, they can't even validate it's right because there's no data. So, you know, that's the dirty secret in weather. Now, there are machine learning techniques that make sense, that you can do, like if you have weather radar, that you at least have real data, right? You're getting data. Although, keep in mind, weather radar is not necessarily always what it seems. Because you can have, areas that the radar beam goes above the precip, and it may be precipitating, and you're not going to see it on the radar. Right? So these are the, this is all the problems with weather instrumentation. There's no perfect solution with instruments. You have to build a village of sensors. Satellite, radar, lidar, remote sensing, you know, that kind of thing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So two questions. One, is is there a well executed accuracy assessment in the weather industry to track these various forecasts against what actually happened, so that we have an objective understanding of, okay, you have these large grids, we don't have differentiation inside, people are doing interpolation, they're training models off of those interpolations rather than off of actual observed data. But who's measuring how accurate that actually is and do we even have agreement on that, within the sector, within the industry, whatever you want to call it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>22:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, the, global models are being actively validated by the MET services. So ECMWF, National Weather Service, they are validating their models. The usefulness of that depends on what you're trying to measure. So, if you're trying to understand how accurate your winds are at 20, 000 feet, you're going to use a combination of satellite observation, and, balloon launches and maybe aircraft observations. And you, again, you're gonna map that out and potentially put it in a grid again. And you may not have a perfect real historical data set, but you have what's the best you can have. That would be on the average how you would, validate a model, using an analysis of the best data you can have and fitting it to a grid. Now, if you're talking about an airport, and you're just interested in validating your forecast at an airport for ceiling height, that's the best example of a really good validation, right? You can say, okay, I have measurements of ceiling. They come in every hour or more often. I can take a grid point out of my model and I can say, what's the ceiling forecast, what's the visibility forecast, the temperature for at that location. And that would be, that's your best set of data to do validation. So the problem is in between. So you have a point, and then you have an area. When you start looking at area, then it becomes more difficult to put a lot of confidence in all your validation. And so what TruWeather's doing, so, you know, just to give you an example, the low altitude has no validation except at a ground level at the airport. And that to me doesn't matter because drones don't fly at airports. And eVTOLs and air taxis mostly won't be flying at airports. They'll be flying out of urban centers that we have no data today. We don't know what the winds are doing in the urban canyons. We have no validation of that. All we could do is run models of what we think is happening. And they're not very good because there are a lot of estimates going into them. So, what we're doing is saying, look, we can't solve world hunger, but, when I saw the drone and air taxi industry coming up in 2017, I said, this is the best business model we've ever had for microweather. Now, you might say, well, what about agriculture, what about, yeah, they're all important. But when I say business model, I meant the ubiquitous nature, the amount of traffic that's going to be flying in certain areas. And the ability to amortize that cost of better services across a much larger array of companies and use cases. And so, my thesis has been and still is that we fill these low altitude weather gaps with ground based infrastructure and with drones that can collect weather data. And we use the satellites and we use the radar and we bring that together around corridors that are going to be your highest use corridors. Let's focus on that. We get real data now. When we run our models, we can validate that data, and we can then do real machine learning. That's the thesis.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:04\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You've painted a picture of the weather gaps that I was not aware of. I did not realize it was all generally around the airports. And, but I want to go back to, before we get to the microweather, talk about the use case, talk about the gap that you're filling. I just want to pull it right back just a little bit to commercial aviation. You mentioned the 40 billion dollars in delays, diversions, and cancellations due to weather, you're saying, and you're saying a large portion of that is preventable. So let's eat into that a little bit. You were part of the NextGen weather ConOps. What could we do today to put a dent? If you're saying a large percent of that is preventable. What could we do today to be able to help address those preventable weather delays? How could better weather, better predictions, more accurate predictions help? And how do we do it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. Well, it's a very good question. I was involved in the JPDO back in 2005 for NextGen. I helped write the weather ConOps I had my, you know, we worked with a couple of folks. We had a vision that, you know, we would have to run more modeling, collect more data, improve the microweather. Cause keep in mind, even around, even at an airport, you're going to have microweather challenges, right? If you've ever been to San Francisco, you know about the fog that sometimes really messes up Air New Zealand coming in. And the challenge is that, you've got to improve the micro weather for the current aviation to help with that understanding of how airport delays are going to impact the system. Now, when Boeing said, because it wasn't me, 28 billion was recoverable, I mean, obviously that's a perfect system, right? We built this, NextGen weather. We couldn't get DOT and NOAA to agree who was going to pay for it. That's how simple this problem was, right? You try to go back to OMB, and I have all this experience in government, so, you go, we went to OMB, we said, look, we need to make this a, interagency kind of thing. I'm going to be frank, DOC, Department of Commerce, they've got their budget. And, NOAA has their budget. And Weather Service has their budget. And, in order to improve and get to what is really required, requires big investments in computing, big investments in other things. We couldn't even get them to agree who's going to pay for it. So that's the first challenge is just the bureaucracy. Then you have the challenge of the current systems that operators are using, we're using a lot of legacy systems in aviation that, NextGen ran into this problem, right? They said, we, you want us to equip our aircraft and do what and pay for what, and then we have to change our software. So the problem is, I made a decision that problem is intractable, right? Let's go after the low hanging fruit. Let's go after a new industry. I think the only way you're going to get to what you asked me, is by demonstrating it. And showing people how bad it really, I mean, how much it's really, costing you and then demonstrating there is a solution, right? And so then I started working with the ASTM. We rewrote the FAA to their credit, said, yes, we got to change the way weather data is collected. We've got to open up the spigot. We can't just collect data at airports anymore and say, that's the only approved data. We rewrote the standard. We got it through. It's published. FAA is working with us right now on how we can test and demonstrate that. Which means then we'll be able to get more data collected through IoT and other things as long as they follow certain rules, right? So that was always my thesis. I gave up on the big picture, right? I said, let's focus on what we can control. Helicopters have always been the bastard childs of weather. So I always knew they would be a fan. And this is where it's going. So that's kind of my answer. I know it's not a great answer, but I'm telling you exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Who's most benefited from low level weather and who really is not being affected at all.

What I was trying to get at is that you can take a lot more weather on an aircraft that's engineered, it's heavy, it's big, it can carry regular fuel, not battery power. You can put more gas on it. You have a pilot who can deal with, unexpected circumstances that will come up because we don't forecast perfectly. And you have a pilot who has flown routes that they know the local weather effects better than the weather people because you don't have the data and they never come back and tell us what they experience because they want to have that as a secret so they can get us later when they say, Oh, I told you it would be that way. I'm kidding. But, the bottom line is that you cannot scale this industry if you don't have better digital information, because that pilot today might be sitting a thousand miles away from where they're flying their drones. They want to fly one too many. There's no way the pilots can even know what's going on. They don't even wake up in the same environment that they're flying in. All those heuristics are gone. I'm sorry to say, Mr. Pilot, it's useless. Because now you're flying somewhere where you've never flown before, you've never experienced the weather, you don't even wake up in the same location that you're flying you're weather blind. And if we don't backfill that information with real data, you're going to have more uncertainty and you're going to be cancelling missions more than you have to. And you cancel them today when you could fly. 30 percent of the time when you cancel a weather, a mission due to weather, you could fly. I know you know that because you always get mad at us when we say you can't fly and then you go, I could have flown today. That's money. And that happens in manned aviation. Imagine uncrewed. Imagine lighter aircraft. Imagine a consumed data source. I mean a conserved data, a power source. You can't add more power on a battery. So now you have to make decisions. How far am I going to go? How much weight can I carry? How much recharge time do I have? And if you're flying people, how bumpy is it going to be? Now this is a totally different environment. So that gets back to your original question. What is it that many few people agree with you, Don? They disagree with me about what I'm saying because they can't see the alternative reality that's going to occur in five years. Every knot of wind is going to be battery power, just like the renewable energy. It means weight, it means distance, it means something. And, that's the bottom line. I mean, I don't see it any other way because I'm so deep in it and I know it, you know, I could see the future on this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>33:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The tendency to cancel due to weather, being, too conservative today. I totally agree with you. I was frustrated with that when I was flying. But at the same time, the cost of traditional manned aviation missions, especially in military is much higher, right? And there's human lives that you're putting at risk. And so there's a tendency to err on the side of safety. But when you're dealing with drones, whose flights are really short to begin with, who don't necessarily have a high cost of returning home, if the weather turns out to be not good enough. That calculus is a little bit different for that segment of aviation. I guess what I'm trying to unpack a little bit more is who sees the business value in this? There's no doubt that there is a gap, but how do you monetize this? Who is it that will take that data, that new weather, granular micro low level weather and have a disproportionately higher impact on their business?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>34:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There's a lot to unpack there, right? So, we could talk about the military. Military is about bombs on target, reaching objectives. It's a different calculus, right? It's also about asset efficiency, asset management, because if you have limited resources and low density, high demand assets, if they're getting canceled due to wet weather, unnecessarily, you're not covering an area over the battle space that needs to be covered. So I can make the argument from a military perspective, which I'm very good at because I was in it about how, you need to be considering efficiency and using your assets in the military environment because they're not unlimited, right? And I proved that at the TACC. So, in the year 2000, I got to the Tanker Airlift Control Center at Scott Air Force Base. I was asked to build a regional weather squadron. I was the first and we built it to 108 people. And then I was at the Air Operations Center. We also supported TACC. And the first thing I noticed is that I was watching how planners and dispatchers were making decisions about how to allocate those airlift assets in those refueling assets around the world. And I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Weather wasn't even in the calculus. They would just plan and say we don't change based on a weather forecast. You've heard that before. I know that because you're in the military, right? So I watched this for a while and I said to my boss, the two star General Woolley, I said, there's low hanging fruit here. You know, we're not perfect at forecasting, but I could tell you. We are certain about certain forecasts, and if we're certain enough about those, why don't we take that into consideration when we're planning these missions? It doesn't mean we change everything. Let's just take a very focused risk management approach to this, where if we're really confident you change that mission profile, you're going to save resources. So he, he was game and we did that. And in one year we cut the delays. They were averaging 5, 000 delays a year from weather out of 100, 000 missions. So 5% In one year we cut it to 1800. So AMC says, what does that mean for us? And I said, well, let's take it to your financial analysts. How many more aircraft do you need to make that up? And what we found was that we saved them 200 million with that. So that's what's falling on the floor today. So we got that study. I'll share it with you. It was validated and we were nominated for the Chief of Staff Team Excellence Award and AMC made us validate everything because they didn't want to be embarrassed, right? So fast forward, that's what I'm using right now for this whole industry. But that was a military example. Now let me give you a commercial example. So I was up at eVTOL Insights two years ago and I had been asked to make a presentation. I was going to be one of the later in the day presentations and there was an OEM, one that everybody knows and is well familiar with that got up in the morning and said, I just happened to be in New York City where I grew up. So you're really in my backyard and I understand weather there. And they said we're going to fly air taxies and we're going to fly eight missions a day with one eVTOL. I said, okay. And, he said, we're going to generate 14 million a year. And I sat there and said, no, you're not, you haven't included the 30 percent weather tax. And it was at that moment that I trademarked the term weather tax because it hit me. People have to understand who are the people that care most about money in a company, the CFO, right? If I use the term tax, that's going to get their attention. So I got up in the end of the day and I said, look, You got a 30 percent weather tax in New York City, and people look at me like, what are you talking about? And I said, that's the price Mother Nature imposes upon your business, both real or perceived, because part of that tax is the time that you ground yourself when you could fly, based on uncertainty. And I said, so you're really going to generate 9. 8 million per aircraft. That's what's going to happen. And, of course,\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Why 30%?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>38:51\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Oh, well, I took my lessons from the TACC, and I took, other data, that we've collected to show that, about, on the average, depending on the city, you know, it all changes. I also said all the weather tax is all local, like politics, right? It changes based on the regime and the weather. But, generally speaking, when I look at all the studies that have been out about AAM, they just look at actual real weather impacts. They say, oh, the weather will be 15 or 20 percent, 50 percent of the time you won't be able to fly, right? But I know that you have to add that uncertainty piece in. So I take that as an average. I feel pretty good about it, right? 30 percent of the time, you're gonna be, impacted if you don't build a better system. So I said to him, look, I said, 30 percent of that's recoverable. I'm pretty confident of that. Probably more, but let's just give you a low hanging fruit. 30 percent is recoverable. So I said, first of all, you're really going to only generate 9. 8. Which they didn't like. And I said, but I could get you back 30 percent of that. And I said, for each aircraft, if I have the right systems in place in an urban area, I could get you back 30%. Think about what that is. That's like 1. 2 million a year, right? Then I looked at him, I said, how much will you pay for that? I said, don't you tell me that, I'm going to talk to your CFO. I said, if I could show you that, how much would you pay? I maintain they'll pay at least five to one, four to one return on investment. We could generate two to three hundred thousand per aircraft for weather alone. We're working right now with NASA, We're implementing, Urban Weather Sensing testbed at Hampton, we're bringing it out to Dallas, it's going to be around Alliance Airport, and we're going to do more of the economic studies behind this. But my argument is that you will pay me for that, if I could show you that I can get you more flight time, and by the way, more reliability for your customer, and if we have the better data, we can keep you out of rough air, we don't have to get people sick. Who are not going to come back on these small vehicles if they're getting sick. All these things. So, it's really hard to believe, right? I mean that this is possible, but that's kind of where my whole career has taken me to this point. It's all been a lifetime of work to get here and then to see the possibilities and now we're acting upon it and hopefully, you know, we'll be successful.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For me, it's not that difficult to understand the value prop as you're describing to me, what I'm curious to learn more about is how do you convince those customers that this actually is achievable and is real, right? Because it kind of goes back to how do you convince people in one weather app being more accurate than another. There's no easy way to validate it. You need to run, large scale, experiments and testing and retroactive analysis. What is the second and third and the fourth conversation and the conversation with the CFO organization look like, can you give us a sense of their skepticism? You're having to convince them how this discussion evolves.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>41:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No, I mean, that's the big problem, right? So that's why I didn't go into conventional aviation because that would be an impossible thing to prove. When I saw the new industry, I said, this is all new software. It's all open data systems. We have ability now to actually make a new market around weather that is working in concert with the industry in understanding how they're using data in all areas of the industry, not just weather. How the FAA is moving to a performance risk based standard for weather, but for everything in aviation. So this is really being embedded and baked in right now into the industry as we go along. NASA's given us several SBIRs and we're going to be going out to Alliance Airport around Hillwood and, and we're going to be putting in three scanning wing LIDARs. We're going to put in the infrastructure that we think is required to get the data we need to run the high resolution modeling and to then be able to run those models every 15 minutes with winds that are unimaginably accurate compared to what you have today. And we're gonna, we have an economist, and we're gonna work with the operators, and that's the next step in the process. I realize you have to prove it. The thing I'm saying is I have no doubt that once we collect that data, if somebody wants to deny it, then it's not going to be rational. It's going to be because of their own personal culture, what they've been raised in, and how insistent they are that the way we used to do it is the right way to do it. I think we'll be able to show that. I just have to sit down with the number counters and show them the results. We have to have a clean slate, we got to throw away the past, we got to look at the future, and then we got to realize the software that's being built in this new system is very easy to work with. So what I did with the ASTM, as I said, all weather data has to be translated into JSON, GeoJSON, not weather geekism. I mean, one of the problem with weather data is it comes in so many shapes and sizes that people can't even get to it to use it properly. So I'm taking a holistic approach and saying this industry is the test for what I'm saying and NASA's been behind us and the FAA's behind us. I'm not going to tell you yet that it's assured. But what I will tell you is that I know you can't do better without better data. There's no data in the urban canyons. You can't run CFD modeling without real data to know what's really happening.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So in the air taxi use case, like you go back to the New York scenario and you postulate that with these micro weather forecasts, predictions into the future, what the weather will be at that very granular locale, that these operators will be able to, fly more often, but how does that fit into their ability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Or carry more weight, or carry more\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:31\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>weight. Okay. But how does that fit into they're improving their profitability on their bottom line because how many hours or days ahead are they typically selling a ticket for that scheduled flight wherever the passenger is going and are you going to be forecasting, so far ahead of time that they can, cancel the flight before the ticket is sold? Or are they selling a ticket and then canceling a flight before departure? How does that time window work? And the contrast in commercial aviation is really quite different because. Well, number one, commercial aviation is so weather resilient that they only cancel when the weather gets to a real extreme. People are buying those tickets, days, weeks, even months ahead of time. But, you know, in, in the overall spectrum of weather, they're, they'll fly in instrument conditions, they'll fly in visual conditions, they'll fly in a lot of conditions and the transportation mode is pretty resilient to the weather, until you get to an extreme. But in these air taxis, from what I've gathered so far is a lot of these are going to be VFR operations. And so they themselves are just inherently more sensitive to weather conditions. If you realize this ability to predict whether it's not a weather observation, but it's the ahead of time factor that it brings, how does that match up with the eVTOL passenger when they plan to buy that ticket? And how does it mesh with, the operators, need to cancel and their ultimate profitability?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:03\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good question.

But here's the thing is that, remember I said, you know, I'm not trying to solve the long range forecast problem. That's beyond my pay grade, right? As you mentioned earlier, you have to run large simulations. We're running a very localized microweather model that could be a 10 by 10 kilometer area or even less. We're going to use the initial conditions that come in from the bigger models. Then we're going to have our data coming in our sensors that nobody else has. And then we're going to nudge that and rerun that model with our data. And then we're going to run a short range forecast, probably out to six hours. Now, you might say to me, well, Don, is six hours enough? Well, the answer is, we're not trying to solve the whole problem. We're trying to go after the most impactful part of the problem. People are going to buy tickets when they buy them. The question is, and I always tell this to people in the military, because remember, I went to National War College, I have a degree in National Military Strategy, and I always brought weather in as part of the campaign, right? I believe weather is a weapon, weather, anticipate and exploit, you know, using it against the enemy. And I also ran an Air Force base. So I understand the logistics. I ran the main staging base in Afghanistan. And so I, I practice a lot of what I'm talking about today and I tested it in real life, but what I'm saying is that last six hours is the key, right? Because now you still have options at six hours out, or even three hours out. The key is not committing somebody to come to a VertiPort where they cannot take ground transportation to get to the airport. That's the key. Period. And that's what we're focusing on. And we're also building an intermodal system. We just won a DOT Smart Grant with Fort Worth, City of Fort Worth. We're going to bring weather into this, as well as air. And we're going to start looking at how, if you can't get to the VertiPort, or if the VertiPort cancels two hours ahead of time, can we get you in an Uber Black, what those road conditions are going to look like. All this predictability, we are just a chaotic transportation service today, right? This is about just bringing more discipline and better data into the system into these decisions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>48:18\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, help me out. So, one way to answer Peter's question, I believe. Again, you got me at today, most of your sensors are at the airports. So what you're saying is, I would assume with drone operations, drone delivery operations, eVTOL, those things that fly low altitude it's going to be, really important to have good weather. Peter's asking, so what? Peter's saying, well, what difference will it really make? So it's possible, even though they plan that advance. Very good point Peter on the commercial side. People already bought their tickets and they're already at the airport. Now it is true. They may not cancel because of weather, because they can fly in almost anything, but there'll be massive, unnecessary delays because isn't good weather prediction. And so I think that's a very big part of the 28 to 30 billion dollars. If I only knew really what was going to happen. So in your case, it's possible what you're saying is, because of the big chunks of grid today that weather is done on, if I know much more accurately where the real weather would be, because of your sensors, for example they're less apt to cancel flights that they otherwise would have cancelled because there is no weather in that spot. And I'm guessing that's where your three or four million dollars, a year per operation would come from. Is that right? Is that kind of the so what, the way I'm reading\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>it? Yeah. You got it. So what is, today you would can't, you know, you might have, I've seen this already. I've worked with some companies where they would have to cancel going back to Peter's point. I was driving away from the long range into the short range. So what was happening is they were doing testing, of some of these concepts. And they would have to cancel the mission two or three hours in advance because they didn't want to bring the people out to the VertiPort only to be stuck there. Or in the opposite state, you're at the airport and they're expecting an air taxi, and now you're not going to have it. So they're going to have to find another means of transportation. That's not as bad as the other one, right? Where you can't get to the VertiPort and now you've waited. You're only an hour and a half before takeoff because you thought you were going to fly there, and now you can't get to the airport now because traffic in those areas won't allow it. So, they were making this no go decision about two, two and a half hours before. Well, a lot of times they could have flown, and this is something they told me. So that's where the 30 percent comes in, right? So now we bring them out 30 percent of the time more than we did, and they're going to fly and they're going to make money. And they're not going to be sitting there with the empty aircraft sitting on the VertiPort, not flying and all the costs that goes with that. Does that help a little bit? I'm glad you helped me tease that out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>50:56\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It does. Help me out a little bit with, drone delivery services. Our sense is that eVTOLs are still several years away at scale, potentially more than that. some would say, but drone service delivery is happening today, and it's going to happen at scale a whole lot faster, arguably, than eVTOL operations. How does micro weather help, now you got me talking only micro weather, so you've trained me. How does micro weather help make a difference to the drone service delivery Does it really, will they make any different decisions based on better weather.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>51:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And I would say just on, on Jim's question, when you're thinking about drone delivery, and let's just take last mile drone delivery, because so many people have a pretty vivid picture of what it is, that's going to operate more based on microweather observations than forecasts. And, you know, consumers will open the app and they will either be able to place that order or not, because this is all taking place within a matter of minutes. It's, you know, it's not like I'm ordering something three, four, five, six hours ahead of time and making some kind of a decision based on that. It's immediate. So it's just, okay, what is the weather along this two, three mile route right now or 15 minutes in the future? And can we go?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>52:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the things I want to point out is micro weather doesn't become as important if you're not flying scheduled missions. If you're not depending on velocity, where your business model depends on having a lot of flights, right? If you're doing surveillance on a pipeline And you could wait another day. It doesn't become as much of an issue. So, the drone delivery one is one of those that really depends on volume. And so every mission you don't fly you're dropping revenue that probably hasn't been told to your investor about how much the weather challenge is. So there's a lot of pressure on these companies. You got to remember, it's not like the current airlines who have baked in weather already, right? These are all folks that are going after VC money or other money. And they're, you know, they're embellishing a little bit of their abilities to fly, 95 percent of the time when it's really maybe around 20, right? So now they're already behind the power curve. The challenges with drone delivery is the winds above the tree level is not measurable and we see a lot of difference in the winds above tree level than the models put in there. The battery power issue, the weight carried issue. It just adds chaos into the system as well as the problem of you have to have three miles visibility you have to you know, be 500 feet below a cloud deck, all those things. Right. So you notice, I even talk about a thunderstorm because the thunderstorm stuff we see coming. It's the micro weather that's invisible or not notable that's going to hurt their business model. So, So, you're right. Now, one thing I will say, Peter, is that you really need about an hour, ahead of time because, you gotta remember there is an operation, there are people loading drones, they're running around the store picking stuff up, so, you know, if somebody puts in an order, it's not like it's gonna happen in 10 minutes, generally, right? So you have to think about the flow. So, if you have, I don't know, just to say you have 15 drones at a Walmart someday, right? That's 15 drones. That's a lot of drones? So every 10 minutes you're not flying when you can fly, you've just dropped 15 drone flights. So even the short range, and you do need the data, as you said. So what we've been advocating for is let's get some wind sensors on towers at 200 feet, 100 feet, 150 feet. Let's get above the tree line. Once we know what the winds are really doing, which we don't have today, that takes away some of the mystery immediately about power management, distance traveled, wind shear, there's other things I could talk about. And then let's get a ceilometer at every Walmart or wherever you're flying from so we can see the cloud height, measure it, because right now they're using the nearest METAR. And the nearest METAR could be 15 miles away and it may not even be relevant. You've been on airports where one half of the runway is IFR and the other half is clear, right? I used to, that happened to me at Kunsan. I used to get yelled at all the time by the wing commander because we would call it seven miles visibility but the approach end of the runway, which was less than a quarter of the area drone, was socked in but I couldn't call that visibility. He threatened to put me on a boat at the end of the runway to take my weather observation. So, my point is that all that comes together. So you're right. The data is important. Having that extra information is important. And then you still need a short range forecast for your flow to manage your logistics, right? To make sure you're not taking orders that you know you're not going to be to\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>55:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>meet. Don, you mentioned earlier that about 40 percent of drone flights are canceled due to weather. Can you talk more about that? And, you know, maybe be a little bit more specific who do you refer to when you mentioned this, and if you talk to drone delivery organizations that are really starting to have some meaningful and interesting scale, companies like Wing, like Manna. Do they have this problem? Do they, complete your sentences when you talk about the issues of winds aloft and how they're not able to predict those and how this impacts their customer service ultimately. Do you have an agreement on the impact that this is having on their operation and how do they think about this? Do you work with them? Do you provide services to them?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Very good question. So what I will tell you is I, we are a Drone Ups company. I'm proud of the fact that they hired us, over another company after they realized that what we're producing is meaningful to them. They've acknowledged the challenges of micro weather, keep in mind that, when I say 40%, it doesn't mean the weather was bad 40 percent of the time. It means that you just don't know. So, that statistic really depends on where you're, what your weather challenges are, right? Some people might think, oh, in Phoenix, you probably don't have a 40 percent attrit. Well, I don't know the winds, right? The winds above the ground, you know, they can't handle 30 knots of wind necessarily above the ground, right? So your weather attrit is not seemingly the same as what you would think about for a regular aviation, right? That number seems high if you're not really on the ground and understanding what's happening. What we tell them, you know, is that we'll get you that, some of that back. And it means that you have to buy into the whole system. You've got to buy into the system of better sensors above tree level, some ceilometers, the way that we, aggregate data and present it through custom, outputs for locale and your decisions. You've got to make very systematic approaches to how decisions are made. You can't leave it up to a local pilot, to make that decision because they don't have the big picture. So this is the kind of work we're doing with DroneUp is trying to figure out how do we, really, you know, it's not just the data collection side, it's also the decision side, right? And how you build the system so that those decisions are made in a systematic fashion, that there's a stable process. I could talk about other drone companies. I don't want to do that because some drone companies don't want to admit there's a problem yet because they're still trying to, raise money. Others, are doing certain things that they feel they can handle it themselves, which may be possible. I just know I've been in the business long enough to know that you can't, if you're going to be a successful low altitude drone company or eVTOL company, you can't just look at weather as a data supplier. You have to have partnerships. There's even a meteorologist piece to this. There'll be times when you're going to have an area that has lots of drones that you want to fly and there's a system coming in and the models are going to say, you know, that system will be, you'll be getting rain at 30%. You know, one of the things I'm finding is what does a 40 percent chance of rain mean? Do you cancel? How do you make a decision with that, right? So, what we say is you talk to our meteorologist, we'll help, we'll get you an extra hour of flight time, potentially, because we say, oh, that 40 percent is happening north, it's not going to move down into your area for another hour. There's no automated weather today that could be the heuristical part of that, like you used to get when you talk to a forecaster. There's still going to be a requirement to have meteorologists in a loop until we're perfect at forecasting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Assuming a drone delivery operation is happening from a hub and covers, let's say a four mile radius, how much does it cost a drone operator to instrument this particular area with the necessary sensors, and then also get the meteorological service from you. What is that burden on an annual basis or on a per flight basis, and how does that fit into the overall economics of those delivery operators?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>59:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so I don't want to give you all those details because that's my IP, but what I will tell you is this. Our goal is to get them four times return on investment. When we talk about sensors, when we talk about integration, when we talk about APIs, and when we talk about getting those APIs properly integrated into, their decision support systems that they're doing. And when we talk about even having a forecaster in the loop every now and then, you don't have them every day, you only have them on the edge cases, you call them up. The goal is a 4 to 1 return on investment. So I'll give you an example. If they're losing, 40 percent of their missions today, we want to get it down to 30%. And if that revenue, we want to get you, we want to get you, you know, we don't want you to pay more than 25 percent of what that savings is. And that doesn't even get into the cost avoidance piece. I'm just talking about revenue right now. We're not even talking about people that are standing around and I've seen this doing nothing because they're waiting for the rain to end, right?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:00:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It seems like, the customers who could benefit the most from this, if I'm interpreting your, arguments correctly are the, high frequency, low altitude operators, drone delivery operations, for instance, right in the near term. Those are also, customers who are very pressured by, cost. And they are looking at every single cent and asking themselves the question, can I afford to spend this cent because my unit economics are really challenging to maintain and achieve. We see this often with, all kinds of supplemental data providers that yes, have a lot of value, but, you know, drone operators might only have the capacity to pay cents per flight for some of this data. So in that context, how do they prioritize the value of weather data and their willingness to, give up margin for it, as opposed to best effort, if I need to cancel a flight, I'll cancel a flight, I'll send it a minute later or a couple of minutes later, because it's really at a small scale.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:01:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, first of all, all those other methods cost money. So if you've canceled a mission because you didn't have good data, and you then had to drive that or find an Uber Eats guy to take it, you've just spent money. We're looking at this the wrong way. You're looking at weather as a cost of doing business. Weather is an enabler to make money. That's the problem I run into all the time. I'm not criticizing. I'm saying that what we're up against is a culture of how people think about weather. Everyone thinks about the cost, but nobody recognizes weather's costing them. You know, there's no such thing as free weather data. It's costing you. So, what I would tell you is this, and again, some of this has to be proven, but I'm, you know, there's an old saying, I don't know this to be a fact, but I know it to be true, right? Weather may cost you overall today, 60 cents a drone flight when you amortize all the impacts of weather on your ecosystem. If you amortize that cost, it might cost you 60 cents a drone flight. Alright, if you start paying me 15 cents a drone flight, I'm not, I'm using this as an example, and I save you 60 cents, I don't understand where the problem is. Why are we prioritizing? You're going to have to lay somebody off instead, or you're going to have to cut costs somewhere else, or, and this is what I say all the time in weather. It's amazing how much value there is here that people haven't realized yet, and they're actually cutting costs in areas that they don't have to if they just have a smarter weather system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:02:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah. These drone companies that, that we've talked to, they have weather minimums where they are flying with about a 50 percent safety margin on wind conditions, rain, etc. So they have a pretty wide safety margin for their go no go. But obviously they want better dispatchability. They want to fly more often.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:21\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So we want to get that safety margin down. You know, we want to get more certainty so you can bring that down to 20 percent.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:03:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't know if that's the direction that they're going to go though, because the drone platforms themselves are improving with weather resilience, so much. I mean, and a lot of it has its roots in the amount of energy that the drone can bring along with it on the mission. And so we know batteries are getting better. We know drones are being built that can handle stronger winds. They can handle more moisture in the air. Icing will always be a challenge, but short of that, I think we see the weather performance of these drone systems improving a lot in the coming years. So, how does that trend fit in with what you are offering to them on a forecast basis? And I would just assume that they're going to, keep the same 50 percent type safety margin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:04:12\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, if you're assuming they're going to keep the same 50 percent safety margin, then there's no business model. Because that, they're, for some reason, they're doing that. But back to the, the question, the bottom line is this, is that we have very sophisticated aircraft today that are manned and they, and we still ground these aircraft 30 percent of the time unnecessarily. The same thing is going to happen when you have your very sophisticated drones. If you ever use the term all weather, be careful, because there's no such thing. I've been told we can have all weather aircraft since 1980s. There's no all weather aircraft. The more you engineer, the more weight you put on an aircraft, there's always a trade off between engineering, weight, and everything else. So I've been in this a long time. It really comes to this way. You have to improve your engineering, but you have to improve your weather resiliency from a prediction standpoint. You have to work them both together. There's no one or the other. You're always going to have weather impacts and you're always going to have margins that you're going to give up if you don't improve the data. I mean, why wouldn't you want to invest in better data and get more margin and get more flights. I mean, this doesn't make sense to me. I mean, maybe I'm, I don't know. I don't get it. Right. I don't get why you have to have a 50 percent safety if you're got better weather data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there other alternative funding sources that are available for your capability or your competitors? Beyond just the organizations themselves paying for your services, will the government underwrite your capabilities? If they're looking at every cent, which they are today, and you're saying, but there's real value here, and they're just prioritizing their dollar, is there an opportunity for the government, any kind of consortiums to help underwrite the costs of the microweather?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:05:58\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. To answer your question, I don't expect the operators to pay, the full cost of this. There's two things I want to mention. Number one is once we get these low altitude weather networks out, they're going to be able to serve other verticals that today are underserved. So if you think about the urban canyons, there's a lot of air pollution. There's a lot of concern about how air pollution moves around transport through urban canyons. This data is not only going to be valuable to aviation, it's going to become valuable to many other verticals and they will buy it at some point. This just hasn't been a business model. The second thing I want to mention is that the states, can invest in infrastructure. So the way I break it down is this way. You have strategic weather infrastructure and then you have tactical weather infrastructure. The strategic weather infrastructure would be like those scanning wind lidars. You don't expect companies to pay, anybody to pay for that, right? Either that's going to be private investment, helping to fund that, that would then, you know, buy into that based on the business model, or we look at public private partnerships like toll roads. Right? So we could see that the states, there's like five business models where the states can actually buy some infrastructure, but then just contract out the maintenance, the data processing, and then, you know, you work out the business model with the state. Maybe, they get a discount for all public safety to use the data, right? And then you charge commercial some fee. There's a bunch of different business models that can make this work, which is why, I'm not landing on one solution. I'm still figuring out all the things that you guys have brought up, I'm well aware of. And so I've been working on the approaches to try to get around those, objections, right? So to speak, to try to find a way to make this work, to make it profitable and make it work. So I don't see the, drone operators having to buy all the infrastructure. I see them buying a service. And that's really where we want to get to. Now, they may still want to buy some of their own equipment for takeoff and landing location that only they have, right, like a ceilometer. But, if we can get everybody to share their data, you've got real data now coming in where you can improve cloud ceiling forecasts over an area to get a much better understanding. Today they don't know what they're going to fly in if they can't see it. There's no data. You don't know if it's IFR around that ridge. You don't know. So that means they have to stay grounded until they know and things like that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:13\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Don, can you share some, thoughts, observations, what it's like being an entrepreneur and building a, a weather business thoughts for aspiring founders in this industry.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:08:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, you know, you guys got an idea of what it's like, because you've been asking me very good, challenging questions. And by the way, I do appreciate it, because, what we're really trying to do is very hard on a number of levels, right? You got the policy. Which I've worked on with FAA and ASTM to try to, you know, make it more favorable to bring in third party weather providers into the aviation industry. You've got the science and technology, which is all cutting edge. Everything we're doing is on the edge of technology and science. It hasn't been that this stuff hasn't existed before. It's been in the universities and labs a long time, but no one's ever pulled it together into a, you know, into a production system and make it into a business case that could work. And then you've got the culture in aviation, like, the questions you guys are asking. These are all good questions. They're all real problems. They're all real objections that I have to overcome. and that's hard. That takes a lot of energy, right? If I could have probably invented the pogo stick and it would have been a hell of a lot easier, right? But I like hard challenges because I've been in this industry so long, I've been fed up that we haven't been able to really change the aviation system, right? It's been the same system for years and it just doesn't make sense to me that we're kind of happy with it when it's so disruptive and costs so much. So, and then selling my investors. Right? So, this is not an easy sell. You have to find people that really get in and understand that it's really about the data. It's not about weather, right? It's about the data. It's about what the data can do. Why is it every other part of the industry says we need better data to make decisions, but weather, eh, we don't need better data. This will work fine. I mean, I just, it's so baffling to me. And I understand it. I think it's the culture. I think it's the way people have been brought up. I think it's just the system. And it's also, really difficult to understand what we're trying to do and understand why it will work. So I get all that. That's, what's been the hardest part. I mean, this, building the business, hard because you need money, hard because we need customers. What I am confident about right now is we will get them. So what's the second problem? The second problem is the pace by which this industry is actually growing. And I would tell people that are, trying to, build a business in this industry, not just weather, is you gotta have patience and you gotta have recognize it's never going to go as fast as you think it is. Don't dilute yourself thinking, that you're gonna, you know, do something different than everyone else, because you can't if the policy doesn't change, you can't if the FAA doesn't change the policy. And the other thing is these, all these other companies I work with, they're all doing new software too, which is what I love, by the way. And they all have their challenges. Like you said, Peter, they may not be ready to invest in weather, right? They may not be ready to invest in something else. So, I think, the key is, you have to know what you're getting into. You got to understand that it's a different animal. We're basically building an aircraft and flying at the same time in this industry writ large. It's not an established industry where you're trying to do something that's entrepreneurial and innovative, and it's challenging.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And as we wrap up, what's, one message that you would like to leave with the audience?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Don:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:11:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Well, I think, you know, again, I think this has been a great conversation.

I do believe that what we're doing is the right thing I'm always more than happy to have more conversations about this. I want to you know, there's things I still have to learn There's people that probably can help me figure out how to crack the nut Right? So I don't want you to think that I have all the answers. what I'm just going to say though is weather imposes uncertainty. And uncertainty in anything costs money. And, the only way that you're going to resolve that is by having real data to fill in that uncertainty gap. And if the data can give you the ROI and you can demonstrate it, believe it. If I can show you this, believe it, right? The implementation part is hard because the companies we're working with have to bring their company along with this, right? Who, again, have a lot of people who would say, Oh, why are we doing this data? I get it from ForeFlight. I can see my weather, you know. So, this is a multi faceted problem, right? That's why you have to come in at the CFO level and in the COO and CEO level. Because, you really got to have a buy in by the company up and down to say, yeah, this is the direction we're going to go in because it makes sense. It's the future of weather. It's the future of, networked information and it's the future of analytics. So you want good weather data in there. Why are you going to spend a billion dollars on all these other systems that are going to give you perfect data and then you're going to use weather as your weakest link in the tent? It doesn't make sense to me. Why invest in all that if it's, this is your weakest link in your chain, right?

And why not using drones for this kind of operations? It can be cheaper with drones, more sustainable. So it's now about delivery inside the port and outside, for example to the anchor area where ships are waiting for entering the port. When a ship is sailing to the port, for example, an oil tanker, before they transfer the oil to a terminal you have to take some samples to check the quality. Nowadays the ship will enter the port, will go to the terminal, people will go on the ship, will take the samples, will drive with the car to the laboratory, do the checks, and they know if it's okay or not to start a procedure for transferring. We're now looking into why don't we fly with a drone to the ship who's already sailing to the port, not yet inside of the port, but sailing to the port, take the sample, fly to the laboratory, and do the check. When the ship is sailing into the terminal, we know the outcome and we can directly start with transferring the oil into the terminal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>1:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hey, welcome back to The Vertical Space and our discussion with Niels Kalshoven, Head of Drone Innovation Program at Port of Rotterdam and Co-founder Drone Port Rotterdam. So, this is one of the few discussions where we're speaking with someone without an aviation, OEM, or advanced air mobility background, but has deep experience where the drones will be used in this case at maritime port, the Port of Rotterdam. We heard about the Port of Rotterdam and its compelling use cases with our discussion and podcast with Andrew Hately, which you should check out. It's become a really popular podcast on The Vertical Space. So after we heard about the port of Rotterdam from Andrew, we were curious to know what they are specifically doing today and intend to do with drones and other advanced air mobility, as well as hear how their current and anticipated operations apply potentially to other ports in Europe and around the world. So we went right to the source to today's guest Niels Kalshoven. Listen to a Niel's describes the use case at the port of Rotterdam, the implementation and value of U-space, the policies and procedures put in place to ensure a safe operation and the volume of operations today, and what's anticipated in the future. This is a really interesting business model; it'll be interesting to see what type of service eventually scales at port operations. Will the ports allow their customers to operate drones independently with some type of centralized command and control, or will ports provide some type of centralized service? Whereby the port customer's contract for drone services with that centralized organization? We generally see both models with airports today where some airports allow their customers let's say airlines to operate independently, or in some cases, especially outside the United States, there are more centralized provision of services like centralized gate or ramp management. We hope you enjoy this talk with Niels. It's great to hear how trailblazers are establishing drone operations, how they justify their efforts and spend and how they see the real value in return from the operations of the future. Niels thanks for joining us and to our listeners we hope you enjoy our talk with Neils Kalshoven as you innovate and The Vertical Space. Niels Kalshoven is the Head of Drone Innovation Program at the Port of Rotterdam and Co-founder DronePort Rotterdam. The use of drones is in line with the strategic ambition of the Port of Rotterdam Authority to be an even safer, more sustainable and more efficient port. Within the port Niels is responsible to develop the port area into an area where providers of drone services can experiment in a relevant environment. In the hybrid port of the future drones be used in addition to vessels, trains, and trucks for the transport of freight and passengers. Niels welcome to The Vertical Space. Great having you on.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you very much for the invitation. Looking forward to this discussion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Is there anything that very few in the industry agree with you on?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>4:53\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. So if I look to the, urban air mobility, and people, agree with me is that I think that if you look at the technique, it's quite far. But if you look at the regulations, there's still some work to do before we get really into the operational flying with the drones in the air, in ports or cities or wherever you think about.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:17\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, Niels, you're saying is that the operationalizing of the drones is potentially further out than what most people think?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, I think so. Especially if you look, to our port, the port of Rotterdam, it's quite busy at this moment. Already now, I think two and a half year, we're looking into this kind of new industry. And what you see nowadays that the amount of operations are still, increasing. So it's quite busy in our port area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>5:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All right, then I'm going to challenge your comment just a bit here. So what you're saying is, that although drone operations may have a while to scale the way people are generally expecting, at your port, the drone operations are pretty much at volume. They're operating relatively well, which is, a pretty darn good drone use case.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. Yes, it is. So especially if you look at the regulation nowadays, it's all VLOS or eVLOS. So you have to see the drone flying. But still, I think we now have 50 to 60 commercial drone operators who are flying for our customers in the port. If you look one and a half years ago, it was only 15. So it's quite increasing in those, is it one and a half years, so to say?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Niels, give us a little bit of a background. So you're actually a port guy, right? You're not necessarily a drone person. So this is a little bit different for us. Okay. Tell us a little bit about, Port operations and how the operation of a port sets up the potential need for drone operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>6:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so if you look at the port of Rotterdam, it's a quite big port. It's the biggest in Europe, not the biggest in the world anymore. But still we have 42 kilometers long is the port and we have 3, 000 customers which are located there. If you look at the port operations, formerly we are a landlord, so we lease our land to our customers. This is one of our income and the other one is port use. So when a ship is entering the port, they pay an amount of money, for using all the, services from the port. So what you see nowadays that there's a lot of logistic going on the, in the ports. A lot of goods are transported inside of the port, but also outside to the inland or to the short sea, to other ports in the neighborhood like Antwerp or Hamburg, for example. And what you see is with the drone industry, it's quite new for us as well. It's already there, but there are many questions. How can you use these drone operations in these kind of port environments? So that is what we're now looking into in several use cases. How we can involve or implement this in the current situations, so to say.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Before going into some specific use cases, do you mind telling the story of how you got started with drones?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>8:09\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so it started two, I think two to three years ago, when we saw that there was a new development about drones and it was first, it was the very small ones and we started to, within our innovation department, and, yeah. Let's start with the intro of the investigation of that. So we spoke also to our board and they said, yeah, drones, drones is something our neighbor is playing in the garden. And that was our vision at that moment. But we thought that it was, the development goes very fast. We say, okay, if you, look into the future and see the increase in the number of operations in the port. We as a port authority should think something about that, have an opinion about that. Do we like that? Do we disagree with that? Do we want to have a specific role in the ports as a port authority in this industry? So that was the beginning when we started with this, research, which is still going on, but that was the beginning when we started to look into these operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:16\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So this was an internally driven effort. It wasn't the fact that drone companies came to you and tried to pitch the ideas, but it was more of a internally grown innovation project. Is that correct? Yes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But indeed also, drone operators asked to our authority for what is the regulations here? Can I fly here in a port area? At that moment, we didn't have any answers. So that was also a trigger to start into those investigations about the industry. So when you\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>9:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>when you started this, you know, a couple of years ago, what was the, primary, areas of concern or things that was top of your mind? Was it related to regulations? Was it related to the fact that perhaps the characteristics of existing drones were not adequate enough, or perhaps they were, was it about, the decision of whether we, hire somebody to do this or do we in house this capability? What were some of the main things that you were juggling as you were trying to decide whether this makes sense?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>10:29\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We ensure that all the drones were flying above the ports, that it will be done in a safe way. So do we have to regulate it or, do we need some extra regulations, inside of the port because it's all critical infrastructure. But it's also about security. Do you want those drones in your area? Sometimes you want them because customers are using it for inspections purposes. But it can also be that we have non cooperative drones in the port with other purposes we don't like. So those were the first topics that we say, okay, about safety and security, that's very important. We want it to be the safest part in the world. So with these new developments, you need an answer on your questions. And we didn't have the knowledge at that time. So what we said, let's start, gathering all the information, getting the knowledge, to know where we get talking about that you have information to where you can base your decision on. So that was very important in the beginning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And so did you see drones as a way to expand the offering to your customers as another revenue source for the port, or was it about enabling the customers to bring their own drones and then operate them as they see fit?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>11:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the Port of Rotterdam, it's really enabling. We do not, build up our own services for our customers. So we are more enabling the environment to say, okay, the drone operators can fly in the ports for our customers. So we really want to facilitate that.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:05\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see. Okay. So you don't, directly contract with drone operators and have them fly on behalf of the port, but you are providing an environment infrastructure, whether this is U- space or otherwise that we'll get into later that lets those, 3000 plus customers hire those drone operators and service providers and help them in whatever they need or they want done.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, exactly. Of course, we also look into the drone operations for our own organizations. But if you look at our customers, it's an open market. They are free to choose any operator they want. Of course, if you look at the port area, it's a specific category, so you need extra regulations to fly over there. But indeed it's open, so you can choose every company you want, national or international, that's up to the customers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>12:52\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What's the need for the drones. What's the, and what's the use case for the drones? What are they doing today that was done by some other means three plus years ago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:00\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what you see nowadays, it's, already said it's all EVLOS BVLOS is not, yet there. The regulations aren't in the Netherlands for enough fly BVLOS. That will, I think, take a couple of years. What you see nowadays is that a lot of inspection is done by drones. Inspection of infrastructure, chemical industries, plants, cranes, all different kinds of things.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:26\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So it's inspection and surveillance at the port. Where previously it was done by what means.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>13:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It was done by people. For example, if you look at the infrastructure, the cranes, the inspection of cranes, and look at the current status of the maintenance, it was done by people. And it took them maybe a week to build the structure, to get it to the cranes, do the inspections, get all the pictures, a video maybe, and then do also the analysis. And what you see nowadays that they use the drones, it is flying, for example, one time or several times around the building or the crane, using the camera, using the algorithms, AI solutions to also predict the maintenance. for example, they will do it first for a baseline and every month, for example, and they will do an update and they can, after several times, they can predict the maintenance. That's very interesting. So it's cheaper because it's less labor, but also you're more efficient in using, drones, for example.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And this is the infrastructure that the port owns, right? So in this case, you're using the drones to inspect your own assets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>14:35\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also, but it's also from our customers, for example, the container terminals, there are independent companies. What you see is that they're responsible for their own cranes and inspections, responsible for their own operations. And they do also, use drones for the inspections purposes. And if you look at ports, we also have, for example, bridges, or other infrastructures, trains, railways. There we also use drones for inspections. So it's both for our customers are using it, but also the port authority is using it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:06\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what is the primary, benefit or value that either the port or the customers see? In this case, let's take using drones for inspection and surveillance. Is the value realized in much, less time spent on doing these things, or is the value in having more frequent inspections and therefore predictive, interventions and maintenance, and therefore you save money over a longer period of time. Or is it something else? When you were going through the business case for these drones. Where did you see the value? How quickly and how strongly does that ROI resonate?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>15:44\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think it's always in combination. So indeed, you're more efficient in, doing, it quicker. So that's, related to the price cheaper. But also if you look to the safety, when you have to build a structure to inspect a crane with, and people have to get up to the structure,\\ it's, I think, also safer to use a drone instead of. So it's a combination of, time management, efficiency, in the duration and also safety. And that's makes it cheaper to use drones in these, topics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>16:15\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the trade offs? You mentioned things that you gain by using drones. What are the things that you sacrifice a little bit? Is it perhaps the, human touch, if we can call it that, of a knowledgeable worker that can, identify things better than perhaps machines at this point, or is it something else? What I'd like to, bring up in this conversation is what it was like convincing management to roll this out. What were the, concerns raised? What was that back and forth discussion? Obviously you mentioned security and safety, and then on the benefit side, saving time, being more efficient, saving, lives potentially, but, can we get a little bit deeper into how that calculus looked like for the port.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:02\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A very good question. We don't always have the figures yet, but if you look at it from the customer point of view, it's for them always about, do it in a cheaper way or in a safer way. If you look at as a port authority, for us, it's very important that when people are flying in the ports, it will be done on the safe way. So it's another point of view, so to say, if you look to our customers or the port authority. At the end, I think one of the most important things is indeed safety. That it's for all people. It has to be done on a safe way and a secure way.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:36\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What changes to existing processes were required when you introduced drones into the workflow?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>17:43\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yeah, so we looked indeed to the processes and the procedures. We're now looking into, we started the proof of concept for a U- space airspace. When they start to fly, they will fill in a flight request. So for now we know who's flying in the air. And that's quite a new procedure. If you look for a couple of years ago, there was none of them. So at least we know that. Those are quite new for us as well. So we formally, we're specialized in traffic management on the water. Now we're also looking to the air. So all those, procedures and processes, which are important for that, those are quite new for a port authority, maybe not so for an airport, but for a port authority, it's quite new. So that was quite a challenge for us also because, sometimes you fly above and the container, terminal, okay. Then a drone falls down on a container. That's not so exciting. Of course, there can be some damage on your drone, but not on the container. If you compare it to a chemical industry, that can be very, dangerous if you look to the dangerous goods. We're still looking in of all those kinds of procedures, what kind of, risk, mitigations must be taken into account for a container terminal or in chemical industry or, flying above, water, for example, ships. Those are quite new for us and we're still looking at several of those procedures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:11\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What about procedures on the enterprise side of, let's say, teams that inspect assets, whether those are cranes or railroads, chemical plants, or any other infrastructure in the port that the port owns. How did their workflow change from, previous iteration or version of manually collecting the data, maybe taking some pictures and then uploading those pictures into some ERP like system that then tracks over time, the state of this infrastructure. How did that change with the drones and were there any required updates to those systems in order to accommodate drones in this workflow.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>19:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes, so I don't have the knowledge of the really in depth and the detail procedures from what of our customers, what I can say is that what you see is that they're now collecting a lot of data, so that is something different in the way of working. So when they're using a lot of AI algorithms to process all this data. And get also good results of all their images and the cameras they, or the images they get into the system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So you talked about inspection and surveillance. What other use cases are prominent today?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>20:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So what we're now looking into is also several use cases. One is, for example, delivery. Delivery of packages inside of the port, but also outside. For example, we have a customer, who's now bringing 130 packages daily to ships and is doing it with boats, very small speed boats. And, yeah, why do you, why not using drones for that, this kind of operations? It's, it can be cheaper with drones. It can more sustainable. That's also very important topic. so it's now about delivery inside the port and outside, for example, to the anchor area where, ships are waiting, for entering the port. That's very interesting for us, but also, for example, when a ship is, sailing to the port, for example, an oil tanker. Before they transfer the oil to a terminal, you have to take some samples to check the quality. And those samples first has to go to the laboratory to do the checks. So nowadays the ship will enter the port, and will go to the terminal. Then and, people will go on the board, on the ship, will take the samples will drive with the car to the laboratory, do the checks, and they know if it's okay or not to start a procedure for transferring the oil. We're now looking into why don't we fly with a drone to the ship who's already sailing to the port, not yet inside of the port, but sailing to the port, take the sample, fly to the laboratory, and do the check. When the ship is sailing, into the terminal, we know the outcome and we can directly start with transferring the oil into the terminal. It's like more, if you look in a port, it's about the port optimization. How can you help that and make it more efficient and faster, and that the ship can transfer the oil and after that go directly to the next port. So that's very interesting for us as well. another use case is looking to eVTOLs. For example, when a crew is, has to be changed. For now, all tech, they will go off the ship and drive the taxis to the airport. Why don't we use air taxis for that? Because we don't have any public transportation over there. Another topic can be that our fire department in the port is fairly sophisticated and is already using drones, when the ship is on fire. They've, if the ship is on sea, they will fly with helicopters to the ships and their equipment is, they have a lot of equipment. It's too big to put it as well on the helicopter. So you need another helicopter. Why don't you use a very big cargo drone to fly the equipment to the ship and the fire department to go fight the helicopter? So those are the next, use cases we are looking into and yeah, can make a difference for a port, not only for the port authority, but for our customers, as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:27\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>90 percent of the drone operations are for infrastructure inspections.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:32\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Exactly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>23:33\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And they're operated, help me clarify this with Luka's good questions, and they're operated by one of the 3, 000 customers of the port.

Very good. and if I could, and you spelled out many use cases for, let's say, AAM. So drones, you talked about larger cargo drones, you talked about, eVTOL, and again, for our audience, you're not a drone guy, you are a port guy. And you're saying, we used to, and historically, we never had to worry about the air, or to manage the air. Talk a little bit more about that. Tell us about how you were first introduced to it, what software you used to manage that process, who are the people who operate it, and how easy is it to operate, and what are some of the challenges there?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>24:25\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. To manage the, the very low airspace, we're now looking in, uSpace airspace. That's, it's quite new for us as well. There is already some regulations for the, from the European Union but it's not in, implemented yet in, in the Netherlands. We still wanted to investigate what is U- space airspace and can that be a solution if you look at the increase of, drone operations in the ports? Not only the small one, but also the bigger one. And also, if you look into the BVLOS operations, then I think it will be very crowded in the air. And that's the reason we start this proof of concept, for two years. And what we really wanted to investigate is the USPACE airspace and solutions. So manage the very lower airspace below the 150 meters. Is that something, interesting for our ports area? And besides that, the second one is, we're now responsible for the water, but is the port authority also the one we should do this? Or is there some other authority who should be responsible for this? Those were the research questions when we started this project, because we didn't know what it was exactly. Then we said, okay, just let's do it. Let's make it happen and let's see what it brings to us. And, it's what you see nowadays is be selected, and, provider. And, they call it an UTM system. And, UTM\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Who's\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Who\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>is the provider, Niels?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>25:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The provider in this case is Airwayz. so they are the developer of the system and we are the operators of the system. So they are, they've developed the whole system and, from, and they have a background in the manned aviations and what you see nowadays, they focus on the unmanned aviations. And within that system, there are several services we, you can deliver, eh, for example, the traffic management, you get all the information, from all the drone operators. You can do the traffic management and you can say also, someone is already flying over here, please wait for several minutes, or do take another route. This is an alternative we can give you. So that's all in this system, and that's called the UTM, the Unmanned Aircraft System for Traffic Management.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:42\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>how do people, you know, file their plan and how do they get approved? And, what's this tactical and strategic deconfliction? Explain that process because our audience will love to hear the practical use case here that Andrew Hately talked a little bit about as well in his podcast.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>26:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Yes. we have several, if you look at the solution of use, use USP, you have to integrate all the drone operators into the system. So the drone operator has his own command and control system for the fleet management, where they can control their drones. And we have the traffic management system. Our UTM. So what you want is that the drone operators, when they start, do the preparations for the flight, so the pre flight, they will, fill in a flight plan and ask for a specific route, for example, from A to B. And, we will look in the area if somebody is already flying there and so not, we approve the, the request and otherwise we will withdraw it. And when they get, approval, they can take off and flight from A to B because we have in direct integrations, we get also in the, in-flight or the telemetry. So anytime we know where the drone is flying, that's is also very, easy. If you looked, eh, into the UTM system, it's like an aerial picture. So what you see is what we have. All the drones will, applied with the fly plan. In the system we also have manned aviation we also have the AIS data. So those are the ships were sailing in the ports. And we're now we have also the non cooperative drones information. So there's several information\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>28:24\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is all integrated into the software, Niels.

That is, we're now looking into the last part is the non cooperative drones. But when we have that, we have a very nice aerial picture, and then you can say we have all the information in the lower airspace and can start with the really de conflicting of the drone in the drones. And that's very interesting. Maybe not for now, because it's all VLOS and eVLOS, but in this case it will learn a lot. We get a lot of information and we learn by day. how we, get into the de conflicting for the BVLOS flights. And also what you can do is, because you get all, a lot of statistics, data, you can also look to, okay, how we can mitigate the specific ground risk or air risk. So make it easier for our drone operators to fly it in our port. And that's very interesting as well.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Speaking of air risk and ground risk, can you go into a little bit more detail what level of air risk class and ground risk you are operating in and what is the resulting SAIL level?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>29:34\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So if you look at the prototype we're now running, it's in G class. So we're close by the airport, Rotterdam The Hague airport. That's a controlled area. So to say the CTR, but we are looking outside of that. So where the area where you are doing the proof of concept is the G class. Because of the operations we have now, we don't have any SAIL 4 yet. It's all about SAIL 2, SAIL 3 some of them. and that's more or less, nowadays, but yeah, because it's still VLOS and EVLOS. But we're now looking into several operations, for example, the BVLOS, and we're now looking at looking in how we can get the drones into SAIL 4, for this and what do we need? What kind of data do we need for our regulators to convince them that it's secure and safe to fly, with these drones, and say, okay, with this information, we know at least it's safe to fly BVLOS in our area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:30\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I see. maybe this is getting too much into the weeds, but I'm curious the ground risk, determination. Are ports considered a controlled ground area for purposes of classifying risk?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>30:45\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I don't have all the knowledge of that, I have to say, but I know that if you look at specific, ground risk, when a lot of people are walking there, Let's put it that way, the drone operator at the end is responsible to look into the ground risk and, has authorization from our authority to fly above certain area\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Okay. And the reason I'm asking is because, you know, just by looking at how a safety case can be put forward in front of the regulators and the fact that it is a controlled ground, area where only the people who are involved are present and that you can, manage that ground risk, and also from a, air risk class sounds like, initially you're flying very close to infrastructure, you're, in an uncontrolled airspace, it seems like it would be already very fertile ground to be able to fly BVLOS, and I'm surprised why it hasn't happened yet in an environment like that, where you compare to, the drone delivery space, for instance, where BVLOS flights are happening over suburban areas.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>31:54\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's true. And that's, I think that's for, if you look to the port or to the Netherlands, that's one of our biggest, challenges, to convince our regulators that we can fly in a very safe way and that it can also be BVLOS. What we also try nowadays is because of the infrastructure we have and all the data and we want to try to, for example, the fire department to get the first one will fly BVLOS above water. And they are not a commercial one, so it's easier for them to do this kind of operations, and starts building up again all the data and convince our authority and regulators that it's very safe to do it in this way and that we have data that we convince them that, that you can fly BVLOS above water with these kind of data and infrastructure we supply nowadays.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>32:49\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You mentioned earlier that you think it'll take another couple of years until the National Aviation Authority is convinced and that before BVLOS flights can happen.

The technique is there, the car is there, but the regulation isn't yet there. So they're mostly always behind. So that's the same what we see now in the drone industry as well. But anyway, what we see now is that the regulators See what we're now doing in not only in the Port of Rotterdam, but also in other cities or ports and they already get the trust that it's, we can do it in a very safe way. What you see nowadays that they are really keen to help us. And we now also will start a BVLOS corridor. which will start from the port of Rotterdam to a test center which is close by, 30 kilometers away. And, that's a really first start for us, to fly, several BVLOS operations, above, water.

And that is one of the questions, for a port authority. Is that something, we want to, let it up to the market, or is that something as a port authority you should want to do that? And that's a very interesting question and we don't have the answer yet. But what you see nowadays is that, for example, if you look to a USSP and you want to get several information layers in that, that sometimes, speaking as a port authority, we have more information than other parties will have. And we're not always allowed to share those information because of the authority we are. So it's also a very interesting question is if we can provide a port authority the services and other commercial parties can also, will be there a difference in services quality and also in, in costs? Is there a price differences in the future as well? And also to the price discussion, it's very interesting and also a very big question mark, because for now we know about what the, we invest in all the infrastructure, but what the model will be, the business model of using USpace Airspace. So will you charge all the drone operators or not? We don't have an answer yet. that's a very big question mark. And we know that we will have to charge them because if you use the infrastructure and etc, maybe it can, for us, it can be breakeven or do you want to make some money on that as a commercial party?

On one hand, it's people who are selling drones to the independent operators that are running them today, which is, relatively peanuts. If you are going to charge for something, Niels, you're charging for access to the airspace, I'm assuming, is what you're charging for. And in the future, you may be charging for a service.

So everyone knows how much it will cost to fly in the port or cross the port and then it's very because we have so many people who want to fly over there and you have to organize or orchestrate in a way that you are still attractive and that you're not charging too much to your customers, that you're not attractive anymore as a port in a broader perspective. So it's, we want to have it at least in a safe way. It's the same if we look at the traffic information on water. You want that it will be done in a safe way and it, you need infrastructure for that and our customers understand they have to pay for it. Yeah. question is indeed, do you have to make a lot of money for that? And that's not always the case for us. As a port authority, I think it's more interested that we have more customers here, who bring their businesses here. And that's more valuable for us than making money out of these kinds of services.

So what in the transportation nowadays is it's under the five kilogram or something like that. Of course, we're looking to the next step is the heavier cargo drones. And when it's allowed also to fly with those kind of drones, up to 25, payload kilogram, for example, then you will also see the bigger cargo will also be, delivered. So it's a little bit depending of what is possible, and, nowadays and what is allowed nowadays. and, yeah. And if you see that it's allowed to also transport bigger cargo, then I think that will also be, that will also increase.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>42:57\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you talk to your customers or for purposes of your own drone operations as well, what are some of the frustrations that you have with current drones?

I think if you look at the products nowadays, I think it's about the distance you can fly, the time the drone can be in the air. And that, of course, is dependent of the batteries. For now, it's all about batteries nowadays. You already see that they also look to the hydrogen, of course, or in combination, hybrid. But I think nowadays it's the combination of, the duration you can fly in the air.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Luka:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>43:48\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Any interesting insights or feedback from when you're talking to customers how they think about whether to outsource drone services to an operator or whether given the volumes, it makes sense for them to develop that capability in house?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>44:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A very good question, because it's also depending on what their core business is. If you look to the example where we talked about the customers who is doing the deliveries nowadays, is for the 130 packages a day, is looking into, okay, let's start with outsource it. And maybe in the future he will insource it because it's then it's part of his core business. And that's really interesting because if you look to, for example, container terminals, we want to have some inspection of their cranes. Those will always say I will use a drone, a commercial drone operator who will do the inspection because, otherwise I don't fly too often. It will cost me too many time, too many, investments to get all, and also in, in labor with all the training, et cetera. It costs too much to do it by yourself. And then they outsource it. So it's really depending of the, the industry where you're in and the purposes you want drones for, for inspection or delivery or whatever. Because I can also imagine if you have cargo delivery daily, for example, the samples we already talked about, yeah, then it can be very interesting to do it by yourself.

I would assume with the use cases you're describing, there'd be an awful lot of ports that are going to have a lot of drone operations in the future. Or do you see it only in, one or two in Europe, in New York, L. A., who knows, in the United States, Hong Kong?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>46:14\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think if you look at Europe, I see a lot of ports starting, investigating how they can use drones in the port. Some ports are farther, some will just start. If you look to, for example, the biggest one, Hamburg, Antwerp, Rotterdam, looking these kind of operations, they also look into U- space, airspace, or, how, manage the, the, the lower airspace, offering special services as an authority. We're not the only one and every port has its own approach. what, which is good because what you see nowadays, we speak to Antwerp, we speak to Hamburg, and that's very interesting because we say, okay, we do it on our own way. We implement U- space airspace in an operational area. Antwerp has a different approach and we can learn both from both sides. That's very interesting. So what we do nowadays, what we wanted to do is that we are building up our own ecosystem in the Port of Rotterdam. They are doing it as well in Antwerp, Hamburg as well. And we want to connect all those ecosystems and exchange the data, exchange knowledge, and how can we help each other in that. So that is what you see in Europe. Outside of Europe, we also see the same is happening. For example, Singapore is also looking into this kind of operations. We have a good relationship as well with them. And, also looking into how can we help each other? How can we exchange data and knowledge? But the difference on also of the location of the port, the country it is in, what kind of port, industry is there, how far they are with their developments.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:50\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of those ports, whether in Europe or Singapore, as you mentioned, which are the most forward leaning, which are, being the most innovative and doing the most interesting things\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>47:59\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>That's a very good question. yeah, Rotterdam is one of, in, in the top five, but, uh, if you look at the approach we have looking into the uSpace airspace, how we develop services for our customers, how we build up the ecosystem, so how we help our customers, and look into their business models to implement these kind of operations. So that's something we don't see a lot in other ports. That's really our frontrunner over there. But if you look at other ports, for example, Antwerp, they already implemented the whole, uSpace, airspace, and also the BVLOS operations. They have five or six drones in the box solutions and can start the operations at any time they want. That's not so far we are yet. So on the other point of view, they're also very far, but sometimes it's very difficult to compare it. So what you can say is that there is sometimes in a port, there is a lot of development going on. And sometimes they just started. They're not so far, so it's not about who is the best, I think, it's how far they are in the implementation and building up the ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Peter:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:07\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Are there roadblocks that these early innovators have discovered that the rest of the community is thinking about how to work around, or are the ports that are being the most forward leaning, learning on their own and benefiting a lot from it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>49:23\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I think, there are some advantages of, and, what we already, for example, if you look to several systems for detecting drones, In Belgium, Antwerp, they have another system than in Hamburg, Singapore, Port of Rotterdam.

So we invite each other as well to look into our kitchen, so to say, and so they can see how we implemented that.

I think the only thing is what you see nowadays in the bigger ports. they also have the capability to invest in these kinds of new solutions. So they are more the front runner. And they can help also the smaller ports in these kind of things. And also the bigger ports are more, they have more complex operations. And if it works over in these kind of ports, you can copy and paste it also in the smaller ports. So that's the very interesting thing. So at the end, I think any ports can copy paste a part of our solutions, not the port of Rotterdam solutions, but the solutions from the, from any port where you're looking into. So I think the opportunity and it's quite big. And, I think there is a lot to do with imports and also looking into how we can implement these kinds of solutions, because it also helps us with the logistics and make it more efficient, more sustainable. we all have the same challenges over there. You always want to be more efficient and sustainable in the future and still want to make money.

You cannot use only radar systems, so you also have to look at, for example, in radio frequency RF solutions, maybe cameras or other solutions. So I think it will be a combination in the future. So what you see is that Antwerp is now using RF solutions. That's very interesting. So we could have a lot of exchange of knowledge. And we're now also starting up one of our own projects to look into that. And it's the same with radar systems. We now are the first one in Europe was doing this.

So what we want to know is who's flying in the air. So that was also one of the reasons we started with the U- space airspace. That brings us also that we have to track the non cooperative drones as well. And, that's what we now do it nowadays. And what you see is that, sometimes it's because people don't know, they're not allowed to fly over there. And sometimes they have other purposes for example, if you look to our own container terminals, we have a lot of, drugs related things that's going on over there. And they also use drones nowadays to get packages from the one side of the fence to the other side of the fence. And then we also have the other side of that's more like the terrorist, thing. We know that we have to invest in these kinds of solutions. And that it's very important to know what is happening in the air. And as a Port Authority, we're only about the detecting. We cannot, do anything about, the next step, get them out of the air. That's something for the police in this case, in our case. So we now also talk to the National Police about, well, we have this kind of data and how can we help you to give the insights of what is happening in our port area. And so that's also very interesting. So there's one topic, which needs, I think, a lot of, attention in the coming years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>56:38\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Niels, thank you for this. this is a new topic for a lot of us because it's, we don't understand port, we understand the drone operations, we understand drone delivery, we understand drone for inspecting things, but to be able to understand the intersection of the drone capability and the ports is really interesting. I'm about to ask you 10 years from now, what are we going to be seeing? And to allow you to think about that, I'm assuming there's a bit of a business opportunity here, for some kind of a service delivery, capability that again takes the best practices of what you're doing in the other European ports and others and that just takes it from port to port and maybe you guys are part of that maybe you're part owner in that but it sounds like there's a real opportunity there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>57:20\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A lot of opportunities is going on. What we also now are doing that we are building up the ecosystem. That is not only done by the port. It's also done by the national authorities. For example, the municipality of Rotterdam, which is close by. We have Rotterdam The Hague Airport. It's close by. We have the province. That's region authority. We have the TU Delft. We several universities. And also research institutions. And what we see is that we have to integrate all those, parties together. And that's the reason we now also started a foundation that's called the DronePort Rotterdam. And from that foundation we really want to get all the knowledge together, work as a one ecosystem. And spread it out. Not only in the Netherlands, but also, international, working with other ports or cities. And that's a great opportunity for us. So we're now focusing a lot of how can we manage it inside of the port, but within a couple of years, I think it's very interesting also to bring our knowledge and experience outside of our port to other ports or cities, which are now facing these kind of challenges. That's, we're now looking in, we're now in, in the phase of, formalize it, the foundation. So that will be there, I think, in a couple of weeks or months. and from that point, we can start also, the cooperation with other, parties.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Jim:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:41\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>if you were to do this all over again, you've been doing it for a couple of years What would you do different?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ccite>Niels:\u003C/cite>\u003Cspan>&nbsp;\u003C/span>\u003Ctime>58:46\u003C/time>\u003Cspan>\u003C/span>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the differences?
